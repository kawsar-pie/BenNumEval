Translation of the problem: Tahasan bought rice from a shop at a rate of 120 taka per 10 pounds, and he brought it home with 50 pounds in total. However, upon reaching home, he noticed that 3 eggs were broken. What was the loss amount for Tahasan?
2. Solution: Firstly, we need to understand: Tahasan bought rice at a price of 120 Takas (monetary unit) per 10 pounds (weight unit). The total weight he purchased is 50 pounds. Now let's calculate the cost of the broken eggs which amounted to 3 units.
3. First, we need to find out how many ""pounds"" represent the broken egg(s). Since rice and egg purchase rates differ, let's assume an equal rate for simplification. So, one unit (1 pound) approximately costs: 120 / 10 = 12 Takas. So the cost of the three broken eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 Takas loss.
4. Finally, to find out the total amount Tahasan incurred for the loss: He spent around (50 x 12 + 36) = 630 Takas initially but suffered only a loss of -
5. Therefore, Tahasan's total damage cost amounts to an overall financial setback equating approximately -36 Takas for the broken eggs.

Soni started donating to an institution at the age of 17 with a donation of 8000 taka. Now, Soni is 71 years old. How many donations in total has Soni made?

2. Solution:
To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many years Soni has been making donations. Since she started at the age of 17 and is now 71, she has been donating for 71 - 17 = 54 years.

Next, we can calculate the total amount of money she has donated. Since she donates 8000 taka each year, over 54 years she would have made a total of 54 (years) * 8000 (taka/year) = 432000 taka in donations.

However, the question asks for the number of ""donations,"" not the total amount donated. So the final answer is simply:

At the Abir market, a person buys 20 dozen eggs. When he gets home, he finds out that 3 eggs are broken. How many healthy eggs did the seller, Abir, have?

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
Given that there were initially 240 eggs (since 1 dozen equals 12 and he bought 20 dozens), if 3 eggs are broken, then the number of healthy eggs would be calculated by subtracting the broken ones from the total count.

Healthy eggs = Total eggs - Broken eggs
= 240 - 3
= 237 eggs

However, this problem is asking about how many healthy eggs the seller had. We know that he initially sold 20 dozens (or exactly 240) eggs, which means:

Healthy eggs (seller's) = Total eggs sold - Broken (buyer's)
= 240 - 3
= 237 eggs

This indicates the number of healthy eggs the seller had after the buyer received broken eggs. The actual problem seems to be asking about the remaining healthy (not-yet-sold) eggs at the Abir stall, assuming a few were miscounted or taken before being sold that day. If that was the question's intent, we can infer:

Healthy unsold eggs at Abir = Remaining after buying 20 dozens - Additional broken found by buyer
= Total unsold - Initial reported broken + Missed/remaining from Abir
= (3 + 240) - 3 (correcting for the already broken ones)
= 237 eggs

But since it's not explicitly specified, our best guess (and intended interpretation in standard problem framing) provides:

1. The calculation would focus on the buyer's experience and not Abir's inventory directly affected.

Mina can walk 200 meters in 4 minutes. How many kilometers can she walk in half an hour?

2. Step-by-Step Solution:
    1. First, let's convert half an hour (30 minutes) to the same time unit as given in the problem (minutes). Half an hour is 30 minutes.
    2. Next, we need to find out how many 4-minute intervals are in 30 minutes. This can be done by dividing the total time (30 minutes) by the time it takes Mina to walk 200 meters (4 minutes). So, the number of intervals is 30 ÷ 4 = 7.5 intervals.
    3. Since we want to find out how many kilometers Mina can walk in this time and one kilometer equals 1000 meters, we need to convert the distance she walks per interval (200 meters) into kilometers: 200 meters = 0.2 kilometers.

Jamal went to a shop to buy eggs at a rate of BDT 10 per dozen eggs (12 eggs). After purchasing, he took home 6 halis (a measurement unit) worth of eggs. We need to calculate how much Jamal spent in total.

Note: Halis is a unit of measurement used in the Bangladesh system which is equal to half a dozen or 6 eggs.

2. Step-by-Step Solution:
   - First, we need to determine how many dozens (or halos) Jamal bought. Since one halo is equivalent to half a dozen, we can find the number of dozens by dividing the total number of eggs by twelve and then multiplying by two.
     Number of dozens = (Number of eggs / 12) * 2
   - Given that Jamal brought home 6 halis or 36 eggs, to find how many dozen he bought:
     Number of dozens = (36 / 12) * 2
     Number of dozens = 3
   - Now that we know Jamal bought 3 dozens of eggs, we can calculate the cost by multiplying this quantity by the price per dozen.

Rafi bought eggs from a grocery store at a price of BDT 14 per half dozen eggs and went home with them. Upon arriving home, he found out that 3 eggs were broken. Now we need to find out how much total cost Rafi had for the purchase.
2. Solution:
Firstly, let's determine the number of eggs Rafi bought initially. Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs and a half dozen would be half of that, we can calculate Rafi's initial egg count as follows:
Initial egg count = Half dozen * Number of eggs per half dozen + Extra broken eggs - Broken eggs
= (0.5 * 12) + 3 - 3
= 6
Then, let's find out the total cost of Rafi's eggs using the given rate:
Cost of 1 egg = BDT 14 / Half dozen
= BDT 14 / 0.5
= BDT 28 per egg
Total cost of eggs = Initial egg count * Cost of 1 egg
= 6 * BDT 28

2. Solution Explanation: Each car has 2 sets of wheels (front and back). To find the total number of cars in the parking lot, you would divide the total number of wheel sets by 2.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Wheel sets observed = 48
2. Cars in the parking lot = Total wheel sets / Wheel sets per car
= Observed wheel sets / (Wheels per vehicle * Vehicles per set)

First, we need to understand that each apple will produce some twigs or leftover material after being cut and processed by the machine. Let's assume that 'A' represents the number of apples and 'T' represents the number of twigs. We can establish a direct proportion between them since the process is constant:

""A steel mill produces 240,000 metric tons of rods in a month. How many rods are produced daily at that mill?""

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
To find the daily production of rods, divide the monthly production by the number of days in a month. We'll assume there are 30 days in a month for simplicity.
Mathematically, this can be represented as follows:
\[ Daily \ Output = \frac{Monthly \ Output}{Number \ of \ Days} \]
\[ Daily \ Output = \frac{240,000 \ metric \ tons}{30 \ days} \]
Calculate the quotient:
\[ Daily \ Output = 8,000 \ metric \ tons \]
So, approximately 8,000 metric tons of rods are produced daily at that mill. This is just an estimation considering an average 30-day month, realistically the actual value would slightly vary during actual monthly distribution of days (e.g., February in a leap year).

2. Solution Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many individual Playing Cards (also known as 'Eskaabon') are there in Jamshad's bag if it contains 50 complete decks of playing cards. 

- Each deck typically has a number of suits and playing cards. For example, a standard deck usually consists of 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, with each suit containing 13 cards (Ace through King).
   - Therefore, for one complete deck, the total number of cards would be: 4 suits x 13 cards per suit = 52 cards.

Now, since Jamshad has 50 such decks:
- Total number of Eskaabons = Number of playing cards per deck x Number of decks
= 52 x 50
= 2600

The problem asks how long a journey took, starting at 5 AM from Boston and arriving in Chicago by 8 PM. From the problem, you need to calculate the duration of the trip from an early morning time, to another evening time.

2. Let's calculate this step-by-step:
    - First, convert the departure and arrival times into an understandable format. This is done in hours since midnight, so for example, 5 AM corresponds to ""5"" (as five hours after midnight), and 8 PM would be seen as ""20"" because it is 20 hours after midnight.
    - Next find the difference between these two times. The start time is 5 + 12 = 17, as we need to represent this in a 24-hour format. So actually we mean the departure was 16:05 (4 PM). Therefore, subtracting we get ""20"" - ""16"" = ""4"".

3. However, the answer seems not satisfactory. This is because there might be a misunderstanding regarding how time zones work or an assumption error while translating or the translation of ৫টায় being ""wrong"", as in it may mean from 5 AM to evening which would actually make more sense if it meant before 8 PM and the duration would have covered daylight. So another interpretation is that:
    - For instance, you take 12 hours off if it's night time. If we consider night duration is between ""0"" (midnight) and ""12"" (next midnight), then you add a 12-hour night journey. Therefore, the actual total hours become ""20"" + ""12"" which equates to 32 hours. Then subtracting the starting time becomes 32 - 5 = 27 hours.
    - Or if we assume the entire calculation without considering a different timezone or interpretation then you have start is still in 24-hour format so ""16:00"". And arrive would be interpreted as 8 PM directly or same calculation gives 20, but actually subtracting from start gives us total journey which is 20 - 16 = 4 hours.

Problem Translation: Oni starts by learning the consonants of the Bengali alphabet first. If Oni learns a new vowel each day, how many days will it take for Oni to complete the process of learning all Bengali consonants?

2. There is no information provided in the problem about how many days oni takes to learn each syllable or character. However, since it's mentioned that Oni takes 5 days to learn a vowel (Bangla Vowel consists of total of 5), we need more assumptions or data points to solve the problem.

3. Let's assume that the time required for learning consonants is the same as that of vowels and that Oni takes ""t"" days to learn each alphabet character (both consonant and vowel). Then, since there are 50 alphabets in total Bangla Alphabette:

   - Number of consonants = 39 (including all 5 tones)
   - Number of Vowels = 11 (including all three types e.g., কা, গা.. )

   Therefore, the days required to learn all the characters will be:
   
   - Days for Consonants = 39 * t (t = days/character)
   - Days for Vowels = 11 * t (t = days/character)

4. If Oni takes 5 days (t) to learn each vowel, then time required to learn consonant will also be the same per character:

   So we can equate it as on i has already spent 5 days on learning one vowel:
   
   - Days for Consonants = 39 * 5 = 195 days

   Therefore, Total time required to learn all Bangla Consonant = Days for Consonant + Vowels which is total of "" 195 + 5*11= 195 + 55 =250""

Doctor Wayne entered the operating theater at 3:28 PM to perform a surgery that lasted for 3 hours. His sister, seeking to meet him, arrived at 5:36 PM. We need to find out how many minutes sister had to wait for Wayne to finish the operation before they could meet.

2. Detailed Solution in English:
a. Firstly, calculate the total time Wayne spent from entering the operating theater to finishing the surgery: 3 hours = 180 minutes.
b. Then, since Wayne started his operation at 3:28 PM and finished after 180 minutes (3 hours), we need to find out what time it would be when he finishes. Adding these minutes to 3:28 PM gives us the end time:
   - First add the full hours given by the surgery duration, i.e., 60*3 = 180 minutes = 3 hours --> we have 3:00 PM.
   - After adding the remaining 28 minutes to this time, the end time is 3:28 + 28 minutes --> 4:00 PM exactly.
c. The sister arrives at 5:36 PM. To know how many minutes she had to wait for Wayne, we calculate the difference between her arrival time and Wayne's departure from the operating theater.
   - Subtract the operation completion time from the sister’s arrival time: i.e., 216 (5h=5*60 mins + 36mins) - 28(end of surgery) = 188 minutes.

So, Wayne's sister had to wait for 188 minutes before they could meet.

Parker sleeps for 8 hours every day. If Parker wakes up at 9 AM today, how many hours will he sleep?
2. Solution with step-by-step reasoning:
Let's start by understanding that Parker sleeps for a total of 24 hours (1 full day) minus his wakeful time (16 hours). Since he sleeps 8 hours each night, his wakeful time is the rest of the day.
wakeful time * 2 = total awake time per day
24 - 8 = 16 hours
Parker wakes up at 9 AM, so we need to find out how many more hours he can sleep for that specific day:
sleep time = total sleep time - wakeful time
sleep time = 24 - (wakeful time + current time)
We already know that his wakeful time is 16 hours. Adding the 3 PM when he wakes up, we have 19 hours of wakefulness. As per our equation:
sleep time = 24 - 19
The answer will be in terms of fractional hours since we're looking for a specific day when his sleep time differs slightly from ""daylight"" (a full cycle of 24-hour sleep).

   - A pair of wings refers to one bird because each bird has one set of wings.
   - The 12 pairs represent a total number of birds.
   - Since one pair equals one bird, the number of birds is directly equal to the number of pairs if we assume that there is no overlap (meaning each wing-pair belongs to a separate bird).

A train travels for 32 hours between Eastern Coast Terminus and West Coast Terminus. The journey starts at dawn on Sunday (Saturday night into Sunday morning). Which day of the week does the train arrive at its destination?

1. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:

The 32 hours spanned from dawn to the next dawn. Counting forward 32 hours would put us at noon on the day after the start (32 is divisible by 24)
    
    Let's count step by step:
    - Start at Saturday night/Sunday morning (0 midnight).
    - After 12 hours, it'll be Monday morning. (We add one full day)

Add another 20 hours and it will reach the West Coast Terminus on the following Wednesday since it's almost half of Monday:

To summarize:
Starting at Night of Saturday => End on Tuesday PM
Hence, Wednesday is one day after Tuesday in a week counting system:
Hence Train reaches its destination on Wednesday.

Tahescan's shop sold eggs for 132 Taka to take home. When he returned home, he found that 3 eggs were broken. Now, we need to calculate how much damage this caused to his money invested in these eggs.

2. To solve the problem, we need to consider two things: (1) the cost of each egg and (2) the percentage damage caused by the broken eggs.

   Let's denote the cost of one egg as 'x'. As given, Tahescan spent 132 Taka on egg(s), so if he bought n eggs then,
   132 = x \* n ... (Equation 1)

3. The problem also says that there were 3 broken eggs out of a dozen. This means half the eggs brought in from the shop were good ones. So, n/2 represents the quantity of good eggs he had at home.

4. Each egg's cost is x, so the total cost of good eggs = (n/2) \* x

5. From Equation 1, we know that 132 equals to x times n, so x \* n = 132 => x = 132/12. But since 'x' is the cost of a single egg, this value doesn't make sense in this context (since it suggests that each egg costs less than a Taka, which is not logical).

6. Here, we can realize an error; there must have been a mistake. It's impossible that a dozen eggs would cost only 132 Taka in the market. I could try the problem again by assuming another approach:
    (Suppose that each egg's price has to be in such a way that the money invested in them doesn't lose its integrity). So I will continue with the following steps assuming different values:

   If we assume the cost of one good egg to be the same as the Taka lost due to bad eggs. Suppose, 'a' is the amount of money Tahescan was entitled to after selling the good eggs, then:
   -The total cost he initially invested = a (the selling price of all good eggs)

2. Solution with step-by-step reasoning:
A standard commercial airplane has two wings (one pair consists of two halves on both sides). So if Victoria counted 50 wings in total, we need to divide this number by 2 to find out the number of wing pairs, and since each plane has one wing pair, we'll get the number of planes.

Step 1: Divide the total number of wings by 2 (since there are two wings on each plane).
Number of wings per plane = Total wings / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 pairs

Step 2: Since one pair of wings belongs to one airplane, the number of planes is equal to the number of wing pairs.
Number of planes = Number of wing pairs = 25

A chocolate costs 2 takas. Over Christmas, the cost was reduced by 57 paysa (where 1 taka = 100 paysa). What was the original price of the chocolate in takas?

2. Step-by-step solution in English:

To solve this problem, we need to understand that ""৫৭ paid"" means 57/100 of a taka. So, we subtract this amount from the original price of the chocolate which is given as 2 takas.

Let's denote the cost after discount by C and the discounted amount by D.

So, D = 57 paid or 0.57 takas (since 1 taka = 100 paysa)

The original price of the chocolate is given as 2 takas which we will denote by P.

We know that C = P - D

Given C = 2 - 0.57

So, P = 2 (original price of the chocolate before discount)

The problem in English is ""4 hours 45 minutes + 1 hour 52 minutes = how many minutes?""

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning.
To solve this problem, we need to add the two given time durations together. First, let's convert them both into minutes and then perform the addition:

- 4 hours 45 minutes can be converted into minutes by multiplying (4 * 60) + 45, which gives us 240 minutes + 45 minutes = 285 minutes.
- Similarly, 1 hour 52 minutes can be converted into minutes by multiplying (1 * 60) + 52, which gives us 60 minutes + 52 minutes = 112 minutes.

Now let's add these two values together: 285 minutes + 112 minutes = 397 minutes.

However, since we are working with time, and it is necessary to display the result in whole hours (which means the calculation must consider any remainder as minutes), the correct approach is to convert both numbers into minutes, then add them together:

- 4 hours 45 minutes can be represented as 265 minutes (as there are 4*60 + 45 minutes = 265).
- Similarly, 1 hour 52 minutes can be represented as 112 minutes.

Now add: 285 minutes (from 275) and 112 minutes which means (397 minutes). So, 397 minutes = 06 hrs 47 min = 6 hours 47 minutes. The remaining time is in minutes as calculated.

2. To solve this, we calculate the time from leaving until returning by subtracting the departure time from the return time.
3. Starting at 10:20 AM for a departure in the morning and returning at 4:20 PM indicates a gap of 7 hours between the two times. However, we must account for the fact the person spent 7 plus another 7 hours outside his home, therefore, the total time is calculated as follows:
   10:20 AM to 1:20 PM -> 5 hours (first period outside) + lunch break
   -> 2:00PM to 4:20PM -> Additional 2.33 hours; (time spent at different places like school and back home isn't counted as outside home time)

However, we must account for the fact the person spent 7 plus another 7 hours outside his home, therefore, the total time is calculated as follows:\n   10:20 AM to 1:20 PM -> 5 hours (first period outside) + lunch break\n   -> 2:00PM to 4:20PM -> Additional 2.33 hours; (time spent at different places like school and back home isn't counted as outside home time)\n   1+2.3=3.3hours\nThe time added together gives the total duration of time outside home, excluding lunch.\n   4. Summing up these hours yields a grand total outside time: 5 (first outbound time) + 2.33(additional half hour between classes & on way back to home), equals  7.33hours."", images=None, tool_calls=None)"

Translating the problem from Bengali to English, we have: ""There are 8 animals in a farmyard. Some are chickens while others are dogs. The total number of legs is 24. How many chickens are there?""
   
2. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of dogs as 'd'. We know that each chicken has two legs and each dog has four legs. We also know that:
   - The total number of animals is 8.
     \[ c + d = 8 \tag{1} \]
   - The total number of legs is 24.
     \[ 2c + 4d = 24 \tag{2} \]

3. We solve the system of equations represented by Inequality 1 and Inequality 2. From Equation (1), we can express 'd' in terms of 'c':
   \[ d = 8 - c \tag{3} \]

4. Substituting this expression for 'd' into Equation (2):
   \[ 2c + 4(8-c) = 24 \]
   \[ 2c + 32 - 4c = 24 \]
   Simplifying, it leads to:
     \[ -2c = -8 \]
     Therefore:
     \[ c = 4 \]

5. Now that we know there are 4 chickens (`c=4`) and from Inequality (3) `d=4`, the solution is complete.

A store sells a newly designed and attractive pair of shoes for free. Jedan met with his 31 friends at the store to purchase all these shoes. How many pairs of shoes were available?

2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:

We know that Jedan has met his 31 friends, which means they are a group of 31 people. Since each pair of shoes can only be worn by two people, the number of pairs of shoes is half the total number of people in the group.

To find out how many pairs of shoes were available, we need to divide the total number of people by 2:
31 / 2 = 15.5

Since we cannot have half a pair of shoes, it means that there was an odd number of shoes needed, and thus another friend could also wear one extra shoe without a matching pair. However, for the purpose of this explanation, we'll focus on the even distribution of shoes between pairs. Therefore, our answer will be 15 pairs, with one additional shoe remaining unused (left over).

To find out how many games Emily has for her siblings, we need to calculate the total number of unique numbers that can be represented by the single digit (decimal) system, up to three digits.
- There are 10 possible outcomes for a one-digit number (0 through 9).
- For a two-digit number, there are 9 additional unique outcomes per each first and second digit, which means 9 * 10 = 90 combinations. So, in total, we have 10 + 90 = 100 options (including zero).
- Finally, for three-digit numbers, it can be up to 1000 distinct choices because the first digit gives you ten possibilities and each of the following two digits yields nine additional possibilities. This totals 9 * 9 = 81 outcomes for every initial number, thus 10 + 90 + 810 = 900 options in total (including zero).

Summing up all the unique combinations of numbers from one to three digits, we have 1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 = **Total Numbers = 1111** games. Therefore, for Emily's siblings, there are 1111 games available in total.

2. To answer this question, we need to understand that Sebastian's weekly salary covers five working days. So if he did not work for two days, the number of days worked by him would reduce from 5 to 3.
3. The amount of money Sebastian earns each day can be calculated by dividing his weekly salary by the total number of working days in a week. So, the daily salary is 1043 Takas / 5 = 208.6 Takas.
4. Since Sebastian did not work for two days, he will no longer earn his daily salary for those days. Therefore, to find out how many Takas Sebastian will receive this week, we need to multiply the number of days worked by his daily salary and add any additional compensation he may be eligible for (which is not specified in the problem).

There is a train that travels from the East Coast to the West Coast, taking 31 hours. If this train starts its journey from the East Coast on Monday very early in the morning, then on which day will it reach its destination?

2. Detailed Solution:
- To find out on which day the train reaches its destination, we need to determine how many days and nights it travels during those 31 hours.
- Since a day has 24 hours, we divide the total travel time by the number of hours in a day: 31 hours ÷ 24 hours = approximately 1 full day and 7 extra hours.
- After traveling 1 full day (24 hours), it will have traveled an additional 7 hours into the next day.
- Since the given question states ""very early morning,"" this implies that by the end of the first day, the train would be somewhere in the night or early days. Therefore, adding those extra 7 hours to the second day (starting from ""next morning"") will result in it being mid-night of the next day.
- Hence, considering that a full day and the night are counted as one day according to standard understanding:
   - Day 1: It travels the first day and finishes the journey during the night.
   - Day 2: It reaches its destination in the early morning.

   ""There is a farm with cows and chickens where there are a total of 48 legs and 15 animals.""

2. Detailed step-by-step solution in English:
   - Let's assume the number of chickens be C and the number of cows/oxen be O.
   - We know that chickens have 2 legs each, and typically cows/oxen have 4 legs each.

3. Form equations based on information given:
   - The total number of animals is 15, so C + O = 15
   - The total number of legs is 48, so the equation would be 2C (since chickens have 2 legs) + 4O (for cows/oxen).

4: We solve these simultaneous equations. Since it's a multiple answer problem, let's try some logical considerations:
   - If we assume there are no cows, then the 15 animals would be all chickens: C = 15, which gives us total legs as 2C = 30. However, this contradicts the given total of 48 legs.
   - Let's check possibilities with one cow and some chickens.
     - Let O = 1 (one cow) then C would be 15 - 1 = 14 (fourteen chickens). The total legs would be:
       - Legs from cows: 4 * 1 = 4,
       - Legs from chickens: 2 * 14 = 28;
     - Thus, the total is: 4 + 28 = 32. This is still less than 48, which indicates another cow will be required. So, we try another variation with O = 2 cows/oxen then C becomes 15-2=13;
       - Legs from cows: 4 * 2 = 8,
       - Legs from chickens: 2 * 13 = 26, now total legs would be: 8 + 26 = 34

2. Now we need to determine Tahasan's loss. Tahasan bought 3 dozens of eggs which means he purchased 3 times the number of eggs available in a dozen. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:

Number of eggs bought = Dozens of eggs * Eggs per dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs

Tahasan lost 8 eggs out of these. Therefore, the number of good eggs he has left is:

Good eggs left = Total eggs - Broken eggs = 36 - 8 = 28 eggs

The price Tahasan paid for all those eggs initially was:

Total cost = Cost per dozen * Number of dozens = 120 takas * 3 = Rs. 360

At this point, we don't consider the exact distribution of money as it has no effect on our calculation. We now just need to calculate how much Tahasan is left with after losing 8 eggs. Since 1 dozen costs Rs. 120 and no refunds were issued for the broken ones:

Remaining cost = Total egg cost - (Broken eggs / 12) * Eggs per dozen = 360 - (8/12)*120 = Rs. 320

The original Bengali question translates to: ""Mason started saving five paise every day. How many days will it take him to save a total of three taka (which is equivalent to 300 paise)?""

Now the problem is: ""Mason starts saving 5 paise each day. How many days will it take for him to save a total of 300 paise?""

2. To solve this, we can first identify the variable to be determined: number of days (which we'll name 'd').

3. We're presented with two pieces of information to work from - Mason saves 5 paise per day and his goal is to save a total of 300 paise. To find 'd', we need an equation that relates these values. The relationship between them can be expressed as:
   Total Savings = Savings per Day * Number of Days
   So, the equation we're dealing with is:
   300 paise = 5 paise/day * d days

4. Next, solve for 'd':
   300 = 5 * d
   Divide both sides by 5:
   d = 300 / 5
   d = 60

5. The problem asked how many days it would take Mason to save three taka which is equivalent to 300 paise. According to our solution and equation, the answer is that it will take him 60 days to achieve his goal.

2. To solve this problem, we need to determine the duration of time that elapsed between Mr. White becoming a head teacher and his retirement in December of the same year, assuming that the school year starts on September 1st and ends on August 31st.
   - We know that Mr. White's term as head teacher started on March 1st and continued until he retired at the end of December.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the number of months he served as a head teacher by counting the months from March to December (inclusive). That gives us: March (3), April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December (12). So, there are 10 months in total.
   - Since each month has 30 days (assuming a calendar of 365 days), we can calculate the number of days he served as a head teacher: 10 months × 30 days/month = 300 days.
   - To find the number of weeks, we divide the total number of days by 7 (days per week): 300 days / 7 ≈ 42.857 weeks. Since we usually count weeks in whole numbers, we can round it down to 42 weeks.

A factory produces 360 motorcycles in 2 days. How many motorcycles will be produced in the factory in 5 weeks?

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:
First, we need to determine how many motorcycles are produced per day:
Motorcycles produced per day = Total motorcycles / Number of days
= 360 motorcycles / 2 days
= 180 motorcycles/day

Next, let's calculate the number of working days in a week (assuming no holidays). An average workweek contains 5 working days:
Working days per week = 5 days

Now we can determine how many motorcycles will be produced in one day during a typical week. The answer depends on whether or not 5 weeks includes more than the usual workdays:
Motorcycles produced in a week = Motorcycles produced per day * Working days per week
= 180 motorcycles/day * 5 days
= 900 motorcycles/week

At this point, we need to consider two scenarios - whether or not the last week (before the end of the 5th week) is a complete one:
- Scenario A: The total duration of 5 weeks does not include more working days.
In this case, the motorcycle production for 5 weeks would be equal to 4 full weeks plus 3 days (which fall into partial week):
Total motorcycles in 5 weeks = (4 * Motorcycles produced per week) + (Motorcycles produced per day * 3)
= (4 * 900 motorcycles/week) + (180 motorcycles/day * 3 days)
= 3600 motorcycles + 540 motorcycles
= 4140 motorcycles

- Scenario B: The total duration of 5 weeks includes more than the regular working days.
Suppose there is one additional day in the 5th week, in this case, the motorcycle production for 5 weeks would be equal to 3 full weeks and 8 days (which include 1 partial week):

2. Step-by-step solution with explanations:
Step 1: Find out how many motorcycles are produced per day by dividing the total production in 5 days by the number of days.
Motorcycles produced per day = Total motorcycles / Number of days
= 2450 motorcycles / 5 days
= 490 motorcycles/day

Step 2: To find out the total production in 5 weeks (35 days), multiply the daily production by the number of days.

""Isla should be advised to take a diabetes capsule every day. However, in July, she forgot her capsule for two days. How many capsules did Isla consume by the end of July?""

2. Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:
First, let's find out how many days there are in July. July has 31 days. Since July had 29 days where Isla took her capsule daily and she forgot her capsule for 2 days, we need to account for these skipped days.
    - Number of days with missed doses = Days in July that Isla did not take the capsule = 2
    - Total number of days Isla should have taken the capsule = Days in July + Missed days = 31 + 2 + 2
    - Therefore, total number of days Isla consumed her capsules = 35 - 2 = 33
    - As she missed two doses: Capsules actually consumed = 31 (all but the two skipped)
    
However, since the question asks for how many capsules she consumed by the end of July, we must adjust and think in terms that even if she skips 1 of her day's consumption.
    
    - Cursory check on the given information reveals a bit confusing point as days are taken without exact reference frame (a day could be before or after July). We will proceed with taking 30 days (July) consumption and consider the missed capsules also accounted in this count due to the ambiguous context provided.
    - Capsules taken by end of July = 30 days * daily dose + missing capsule if it was considered as one

So, Isla consumed 31 capsules.

Vivian annually spends 2000 taka for her car insurance. How much does she spend on it over a decade?

Solution Enhancement:

1. Determine Vivian's yearly expense; this is given as 2000 taka each year.
    - Let Y represent Vivian's yearly expense: Y = 2000 (taka).

2. Calculate the spending over a decade, which is equivalent to ten years.
    - Monthly expense: Since a regular year has about twelve months, yearly expense is distributed within those months. To find monthly expense, divide the yearly expense by thirteen (approximately): M = Y/12 = 2000/12 ≈ 167 (taka).
    - Months over a decade: Decades consist of ten years and each contains 120 months in total. Let's consider the number of months over the decade as: Mo = 120 (months).

3. Calculate Vivian’s spending on car insurance for a duration of one decade.
    - Total expenditure in taka is achieved by multiplying the monthly budget with the total number of months across the decade: T(total) = M * Mo = 167 * 120 ≈ 20,040 (taka).

Upon executing these calculations, the answer emerges as:

   1. First, we need to identify how many bones there are in the human body to understand the total number of examining times required. Generally, an adult human has around 206 bones (however, we will use the figure 5 for simplicity since the given information mentions ""every single bone"").
   2. Arya examines every single bone at a rate of 1 bone per hour over a period of 5 hours.

2. Detailed Step-by-step Solution with Explanations:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We know that the total number of animals is 11, and Harry counted a total of 30 feet. It's also given that there are only hens and horses in this farm. Let H represent the number of hens and R represent the number of horses.

Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given information
From the problem statement, we have two pieces of information which can be represented by two equations:

Equation (1): H + R = 11 (total number of animals)
Equation (2): 2H + 4R = 30 (total number of feet)

Step 3: Solve the system of equations
First, multiply Equation (1) by 2 to align it with Equation (2):
2(H + R) = 2 * 11
2H + 2R = 22

Next, subtract this new equation from Equation (2):
(2H + 4R) - (2H + 2R) = 30 - 22
2R = 8

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find R:
R = 8 / 2
R = 4

Step 4: Find the final numerical answer
The number of horses in the farm is 4.

2. Detailed step-by-step solution:
   - The Roman numerals used to create sketches start from 1 (I), and since every student draws based on their roll number, we need a total of all the collected sketches.
   - There are five sketches for each Roman numeral, which means there is a fixed number of students drawing each numeral multiple times to reach five instances per numeral.
   - Since five sketches of 'I' are made (from roll numbers 1, 4, 6, 9, 11), 4 additional students for 'II', and so on, we add these sequentially.
   
   The number of students in the class is found by summing up the sketches made:
   - For I (1 to 5): there are 5 sketches (from 1 person)
   - For II (6 to 10): there are 4 additional sketches (from another 4 people)
   - For III (11 to 15): there are 3 additional sketches (from another 3 people)

2. Solution: First, determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 25 to find when their cycles overlap. The LCM of 15 is 3 × 5 and for 25, it's 5^2. So the LCM will be 3 × 5^2 = 75 minutes.

   Anis starts by learning the Bangla vowels first. If it takes Anis 9 days to learn a vowel chart, how many days will it take her to learn all the Bangla vowels?

2. Solution & Steps:
   Let's suppose that learning each set of consonants or vowels (whichever comes first) takes Anis 9 days. Since there are more sets of Bangla vowels, it would take 3 sets × 9 days/set = 27 days to learn all the vowels. But since she has already learned the vowels from her initial learning phase (as stated that she started with learning Banla consonants), Anis's total days spent learning Bangla is:
   21 days (consonants) + 9 days (vowels) = 30 days.

   Therefore, it would take Anis **30** more days to learn all the consonants if she started from scratch with no prior knowledge gained.

Santiago moved from his own country in January and returned on the same date in December after staying in Australia for a few months. How many months did Santiago stay in Australia?
2. Detailed Mathematical Solution:
To find out how many months Santiago stayed in Australia, we subtract 1 (January) from 12 (December) because January is also included in the period of his stay outside of Australia. However, since both the departure and return dates are on the same date and the problem states that he returned ""after staying a few months"", it implies that his total time abroad plus the 1-month gap between the end of December and beginning of January also includes 8 months because 12 - 4 = 8.

2. Solution in English with step-by-step reasoning:
3. The working period of three days should be translated into hours. With one day consisting of 24 hours, we multiply the number of workdays (which here is only one part of the problem) by those hours.
   
   Total Machine Working Hours = Number of Days * Hours per Day

   In this case:
   36 Hours (the answer for how many hours the machine worked) would be = 1 days * 12 hours/day (or vice versa, as indicated within each day’s calculation).

She then started watching a 3-hour movie series, and her laptop suddenly shut down at 5:44 PM because the battery ran out while she was watching it. How long did Hannah have left to watch her movie?

Step 1: Calculate the remaining time the movie lasted beyond the full charge duration.
The battery ran out after 2 hours, as the laptop was fully charged at 3:20 PM and shut down at 5:44 PM. So, subtracting the 2-hour mark, Hannah had watched for an additional 2.2667 hours (from 3:20 PM to 5:44 PM).

Step 2: Find out how long the movie was.
We know that Hannah had watched only half of her full battery life when she could no longer watch (2 hours), so it means the total time for the movie was twice as long, or $2 \times 2.267 = 4.53$ hours.

Step 3: Calculate Hannah's remaining movie time.
Subtract the half-lifetime of her laptop from the total movie time to find out how much of it is left: $4.53\, \text{hours} - 2.267\, \text{hours}= 2.263\, \text{hours}$. However, we should have used the half-life of $2$-hour mark precisely, which means that the remaining time is $15$ minutes and not exactly equal to `2.263` hours because the battery ran out at an exact instant during playback.

2. Assuming each chicken has 2 feet and each cow has 4 feet, let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'v'.
   - The total feet equation becomes: 2c + 4v = 38
   - The total animals equation is given by: c + v = 12
   
   We now have a system of two equations with two variables:

Steola works for a pharmaceutical company and receives a monthly salary of $4919$. Last year, she took a two-month unpaid leave. We need to find Steola's annual income for last year.

2. Solution (Step by Step):

First, let's calculate Steola's monthly salary for 10 months since she didn't work during 2 months due to her unpaid leave.
Monthly salary = $4919
Unpaid leave duration = 2 months

Total earnings for 10 months = Monthly salary * (Number of months - Unpaid leave duration)
                          = $4919 * (10 - 2))
                          = $4919 * 8
                          = $39,352

Next, we need to find her annual income.
Annual salary = Earnings for 10 months / Number of months in a year
              = $39,352 / 12
              = $3,280

However, since Steola took two months of unpaid leave last year, the total annual income should not include these two lost months. Hence, we need to consider her actual earnings for only 10 months.

The chess game of Abha and Sara has decided, but it turned out that there were no pieces left. How many pieces were present originally?

2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
1. It is given that there are no pieces left after the game. This implies that all the pieces have been moved or accounted for.
2. The total number of pieces in a standard chess set, regardless of the color (white or black), is 32.

Translated Problem: Rafik bought a dozen eggs for 120 taaka from the shop and on reaching home, found that 6 eggs were broken. What was the total cost of each egg in taakas?

2. Detailed Solution:
   - Rafik initially bought a dozen (12) eggs for 120 taaka. We need to determine the total amount spent per egg accounting for the spoiled ones.
   
   First, calculate the total cost for the 6 damaged eggs:
     - The shopkeeper should have replaced these eggs at no extra charge since they were found damaged after reaching home. But to maintain the logic of calculus of cost per egg including a possible additional price for replacement due to breaking:
     - Let's denote the original price per egg as p and assume that when Rafik bought those eggs, he had to pay an additional q for the spoiled ones.

   Hence, we have:
     \[ (p + q) * 6 = \text{Additional Cost}\]
     - Since no replacement cost is specified, we treat the problem assuming q = 0, so the price for each egg remains uniformly p, which makes sense given the lack of additional charge mentioned.

   Next, calculate how much it would cost per good egg using the remaining eggs:
     \[ p * (12 - 6) = \text{Total Cost Left}\]
     - This translates into the amount spent on working with undamaged merchandise. As q=0 we calculate simply:
     \[ p * 6 = 120\]
     - From here, solving for p gives us the base cost per egg:

     \[ p = \frac{120}{6} = 20\]

So, Rafik has spent a total sum of 120 taaka on eggs where each good-working egg costs him an even amount of money;
  - In conclusion: The price per egg in this context is 20 taakas.

2. Solution: To find out how long we need to wait for the train from Huwara station, we first need to understand that the difference between the time of departure (22:35) and our arrival time at Huwara station (20:35) is 2 hours. Since trains often have a difference in their schedules based on the distance they cover, it can imply that on certain routes, they leave late from one station but early for the next one.

So, even though the train departs at 22:35, if there's no need to wait more than this deviation (which could be due to unexpected delays or scheduling difference), we don't need extra waiting time. It seems like waiting till 20:35 is enough in this case because the train can arrive early and leave on time after passengers get on at Huwara station. Hence,

2. Solution with Explanation:
First, we need to convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per minute.
Since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 60 seconds in a minute, to convert the speed to km/min, we multiply the given speed by (1000 meters)/(60 seconds) = 95 m/s * (1 km/1000 m) / (1 min/60 s) = approximately 95/60 km/min.

Next, since Victoria is traveling for 2 minutes, we multiply her speed in km/minute by the number of minutes to get the total distance traveled: 95/60 km/min * 2 min = approximately 3.17 km.

   - Let the number of chickens be represented by $x$ and the number of cows by $y$. We know that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. Therefore, we can write two equations:

     20 &= x + y & \text{(total number of animals)}

     \[ x = 20 - y \]
   - Next, we substitute this value into equation (1):
     \begin{align}
     60 &= 2(20 - y) + 4y \\

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of vacation days Joy took over the year. We know that there are 12 months in a year and Joy takes 2 vacation days per month. So, the total number of vacation days is calculated by multiplying the number of months by the number of days taken off each month.\n\nVacation days = Months per year * Days of vacation per month\n= 12 * 2\n= 24\n\n3. Therefore, Joy took a total of 24 vacation days over that year.\n\n\\boxed{Answer: 24}', images=None, tool_calls=None)"

A rectangular park's perimeter was fenced with a total cost of Tk224. What is the cost to fence just one side (i.e., one edge) of the rectangular park?

2. Detailed Solution Step-by-Step:
To determine the cost to fence one side of the rectangle, we can use the perimeter formula for a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width:
    - Given that the total cost (C_total) to fence the entire perimeter was Tk224, we need to find the individual cost-per-edge (C_edge). Therefore, we are looking for C_edge = C_total / Perimeter.
    - However, in this problem, the perimeter is not explicitly given because there is no clear definition of the lengths of each side—only a total number of units (Tk224). So our approach will directly assume that every edge costs the same amount, hence no division process here. The answer is straightforward, since we are not looking to divide any costs across lengths or multiple instances.
    - Therefore, it's stated clearly in the problem that it costs Tk224 for both length and width combined without further breakdown. Since the total cost is already given as a single figure, C_edge = 224/4 = 56 (where 4 represents the four sides of a rectangular park).

3. Conclusion:
The answer to the question of how much it costs to fence one side of the rectangular park is a straightforward calculation using the problem's given data and without any need for further division into edges. Therefore, each individual edge (or side) costs Tk56.

The problem states: ""Jamal bought eggs from a store at MM taka each and used a total of three halis (hundreds) of eggs in his household. How much money did Jamal spend?""

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning.

Let's denote the price per egg as P (P = MM taka). We know that Jamal bought three halis (hundreds) of eggs. So, the total number of eggs he bought is 3 * 100 = 300 eggs.

The cost for these 300 eggs can be calculated by multiplying the price per egg by the total number of eggs:

Cost = P * Number of eggs
     = MM taka/egg * 300 eggs
     = 300 \* MM taka

However, we cannot calculate the exact cost without knowing the value of 'MM', which is missing from the problem.

2. Solution:
Rafi bought a total of half a dozen egg cartons, which amounts to 6 eggs × 144 Takas = 864 Takas.
Since each carton contains 12 eggs and he bought 6 eggs (which makes half a carton), the total cost for 3 broken eggs is:
Cost per egg × Number of broken eggs = 144 Takas/carton × (3 eggs / 12 eggs)

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:

The probability is determined by the ratio of favorable outcomes (people born on specific dates that fall within two years) to the total sample space (all possible birthdates for people in those years).

First, we identify the favorable scenario. This involves determining birthdates that fall strictly before February 29th but would become a legal date if that day were included as a leap year. For example: January 31st could be followed by a leap year in which February 29th is valid, and so forth until all possible combinations within the sample period are exhausted.

Assuming that the two years preceding and following the focus date of February 29, 2023 would fit into this category:
- January 1 to December 31 (non-leap): 365 x 2 = 730 possible dates
- Leap year February 1 to 29: 31 + 28 = 59
- Non-leap year February 1 to 28: 28 + 2

So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 730 (both years non-leap) + 59 (leap year including February) ≈ 789.

Now we calculate the probabilities:
Let T be the total sample space. The year 2022 has 366 days. Adding these numbers up gives us a total of 366 * 2 = 732 possible birthdates in both years.

Hence, the probability is given by the ratio of 'favorable outcomes' to 'total sample space.'
Probability (Feb 29) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of days across two years)
= 789 / 732
≈ .1076 or 10.76%.

Therefore, the probability that a person born on February 29th would have their birthday on February 29th is 10.76%.

Tahasan bought eggs from his shop at a rate of Rs. 132 per dozen, and decided to buy half a dozen eggs. After reaching home, he discovered that 6 eggs are broken. What was the loss Tahasan suffered in terms of money?

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:

Firstly, let's calculate the cost of half a dozen eggs:
1 dozen = 132 Rs
Half of a dozen = Half of 132 Rs = 132 / 2 = Rs. 66

Tahasan paid Rs. 66 for half a dozen eggs, and he found out that 6 eggs (which is 3/7th of a dozen) were broken and had to be discarded. So, he was left with (1/2 - 3/7) dozen eggs:

Remaining eggs = 1/2 dozen - 3/7 dozen
                      = (7-6)/14 dozen
                      = 1/14 dozen

Since this remaining part represents the usefulness of his money, we can say that Rs. 66 buys him 1/14 of a dozen eggs. Now, to find out how much he loss due to the broken eggs:

Total cost for 3/7th dozen = (3/7)*132 Rs = Rs. 58

So, Tahasan had to pay Rs. 66 and got just worth of Rs. 58 from it (3/7th dozen), so his loss in money is:

Loss = Total cost - Worth of remaining eggs
          = 66 Rs - 58 Rs
          = Rs. 8

So, Tahasan had a loss of Rs. 8 due to the broken eggs.

Translation of the problem: The price of a pencil is 6 taka and Elizabeth has only 5 taka in her pocket. She borrowed 53 paysa from a neighbor. Now, how much more paysa will Elizabeth need to buy one pencil?
2. Solution with step-by-step reasoning:
   - First, let's convert the paysa amount into taka because the price of the pencil is given in taka. Paya is 1/100th of a taka. So, 53 paysa = 53 * (1/100) = 53/100 taka = 0.53 taka.
   - Elizabeth currently has 5 taka + 0.53 taka from the borrowed money = 5.53 taka.
   - The price of one pencil is 6 taka. So, she needs to pay the remaining amount after using her current money. Therefore the additional amount needed is: Price of a pencil - Elizabeth's available money = 6 taka - 5.53 taka=0.47 taka.

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning.
First, let's determine if Roman would have slept or woke up on time today. Since he sleeps for 7 hours and wakes up at 9 AM, it implies that he went to bed at 2 AM (12 PM + 2 hours = 2 AM).

Now, we know that he goes to bed at 2 AM every night. Assuming tonight is not an exception, he will go to sleep at the same time (i.e., 10 PM) as yesterday since there's no indication of a change in his sleeping pattern. Therefore, he will wake up at 5 AM tomorrow morning (10 PM + 7 hours = 5 AM).

There are five complete decks in a shopkeeper's Taz game. How many different face cards are there in total?

2. Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:

First, we need to know what constitutes a deck and how many face cards each deck has. A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards. In a deck, the face cards are Jack (J), Queen (Q), and King (K). There are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit in a single deck has one Jack, one Queen, and one King, which makes three face cards per suit. Considering there are four suits, the number of face cards in a standard deck is therefore 3 face cards/suit × 4 suits = 12 face cards.

Since this problem involves five complete decks, we can find the total number of face cards by multiplying the number of face cards per deck by the number of decks:

""Five objects each having a cube shape have all their outer surfaces painted."" We are asked to find the total number of outer surfaces painted by Ikiel.

2. Detailed Step-by-step Solution:
A single cube has six faces, but since we are dealing with five identical cubes, where each face is either painted or unpainted in a symmetrical manner, some of the faces will overlap and end up not needing to be double-counted from both objects. Here's how it breaks down:

    - First cube: Full six painting ⇔ Full color on 1st cube (6 faces).
    - Second cube: Share two painted faces with the first and have two new unique ones ⇔ Contribution on 2nd cube (4 new unique + 6 overlap from 1+2) = 4.
    - Third cube: Share 3 faces painted while overlapping with previous ones, has three brand-new ones ⇔ Contribution on 3rd cube (3 faces not previously counted).
    - Fourth cube would follow the same logic of the second but mirrored for simplicity. So, it will have additional two new unique faces ⇔ Contribution of 4th = 2 new ones (already considered the overlaps of the second one)
    - Fifth cube follows like third in simplification. It has three faces, each not counted before ⇔ Contribution of 5th = 3 new ones.

Combining all:
First object: 6
Second additional to first: 4
Third additional to up-to-now first two and overlap-managed: 3
Fourth overlaps with second mirrored and unique as those from it: 2 (already considered fourth)
Fifth following the third pattern: each unique non counted before = 3.
    
However, since we are to consider the full unique outer faces painted across all five: We need a total unique faces across whole cubes not reduplicate counts, simply adding the individual contributions above gives full sum; $=6+4+3+2+3$=18 total surface areas initially painted.

Here\'s how it breaks down:\n\n    - First cube: Full six painting ⇔ Full color on 1st cube (6 faces).\n    - Second cube: Share two painted faces with the first and have two new unique ones ⇔ Contribution on 2nd cube (4 new unique + 6 overlap from 1+2) = 4.\n    - Third cube: Share 3 faces painted while overlapping with previous ones, has three brand-new ones ⇔ Contribution on 3rd cube (3 faces not previously counted).\n    - Fourth cube would follow the same logic of the second but mirrored for simplicity. So, it will have additional two new unique faces ⇔ Contribution of 4th = 2 new ones (already considered the overlaps of the second one)\n    - Fifth cube follows like third in simplification. It has three faces, each not counted before ⇔ Contribution of 5th = 3 new ones.\n\nCombining all:\nFirst object: 6\nSecond additional to first: 4\nThird additional to up-to-now first two and overlap-managed: 3\nFourth overlaps with second mirrored and unique as those from it: 2 (already considered fourth)\nFifth following the third pattern: each unique non counted before = 3.\n    \nHowever, since we are to consider the full unique outer faces painted across all five: We need a total unique faces across whole cubes not reduplicate counts, simply adding the individual contributions above gives full sum; $=6+4+3+2+3$=18 total surface areas initially painted.\n\n3.

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
   Since each member will need one pair ofgloves and a pair consists of 2 gloves, we can find the minimum number of glovess required by dividing the total number of participants by 2.

Mathematically, our calculation can be represented as follows:
   
Total Members = 63
Minimum Gloves needed per member = 1 Pair (2 Gloves per Pair)

Minimum Number of Glovess = Total Members * Minimum Gloves need per member
= 63 * 2
= 126

Thus, each participant requires 2 gloves and hence the minimum number ofglovess needed is:

2. Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English: A standard deck of playing cards contains 52 cards, which are further classified into 4 suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades) containing 13 ranks each (Ace through 10). If Elisa intends to carry a deck of cards for her journey, and if each deck consists of 6 cards, then the question implicitly assumes that she is carrying multiple partial decks or perhaps taking only specific sets of cards from a whole deck. Assuming the latter case and considering an average hand size (let's say 5 cards), the total number of cards can be found based on how many times the full-deck equivalent of 52 can fit into the selected set of cards by Elisa. Let's use the provided information:
    - A full deck has 52 cards.
    - Each full deck is divided into groups of 6 cards each.
    - A hand size we assume to be an average of 5 cards per selection. Therefore, for each selected group of 6 cards, a suitable selection may consist of up to 4 hands.

2. Solution Steps:

a) We need to find out how much money Penelope saves per month and then multiply it by 12 (months in a year).

b) To find out the amount saved per day, we first convert the decimal form to monthly savings. If she saves 24 Takas per day, we will calculate it for various months:
   March, June, September, and December have 31 days.
   Months with 30 days are: April, July, October, and January (assuming a leap year).

c) Convert daily savings into monthly savings:
   - Penelope's monthly savings for a month like March, where the day count is maximum:

d) As most months have either similar or fewer days than March (considering leap year), her monthly savings in these months are not less than 600 Takas.

e) Multiply Penelope's monthly savings by the number of months to get the total yearly savings:
   - Yearly savings = Monthly savings x Number of months

2. Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
   - Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as M.
   - From the problem, we know that there are a total of 9 animals, so C + M = 9.
   - We also know that chickens have 2 feet each and cows have 4 feet each. So, the total number of feet is 2C (feet from chicks) + 4M (feet from cows) = 26.
   - Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we know that C = 9 - M. Substituting this into the second equation gives us 2(9 - M) + 4M = 26.

Translation of the Bengali Problem into English:
A teacher divides a group of 40 male students and 24 female students into some teams, ensuring that each team has an equal number of males and females. We need to determine the maximum number of teams the teacher can divide them into and how many males and females would be in each team if they are divided equally in every team, with no student left out.

2. Detailed step-by-step solution:
  2.1 First, we need to find a total number of students (40 males + 24 females) that can be evenly distributed into teams so each team has an equal amount of male and female students. The total number of students is 40 + 24 = 64.

  2.2 To make sure the number of male and female students in each group is equal, we must have a common divisor that works for both, which means finding factors of 40 (number of males). The possible factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.

  2.3 Checking the possibility with each factor:
     - For Factor 10: If we divide into 10 teams, then there would be (40/10 = 4) males and (24/10 = 2.4). The number of female students in a team doesn't seem to divide evenly. Consequently, 10 is not an appropriate divisor.
     - For Factor 8: If we divide into 8 teams, then there would be (40/8 = 5) males and (24/8 = 3). We can see that the number of females in a team does not allow for even distribution without leftovers if divided as such. Hence, 8 is also not appropriate.
     - For Factor 4: If we divide into 4 teams, then there would be (40/4 = 10) males and similarly (24/4 = 6) females per team. This allows us to have equal numbers of each gender in every group (a total of 10 + 6 = 16 students per group).

""A rectangular park is to be used for boating, and the total cost of boating was 172 Taka. How much did it cost per section/side?""

2. Solution:
To find out the cost per side, we need to divide the total cost by the number of sides in a rectangle which has two lengths and two widths resulting in total four sides. However, since the problem asks for individual side costs, let's assume these are symmetrical rectangles and so both length (l) and width (w) contribute equally to cost distribution.
   Let x be the cost per side. Since there are 4 sides, the equation will look like this:
   4x = 172Taka

To solve for x, divide both sides by 4:

   x = 172 / 4
   x = 43 Taka

Therefore, it costs 43 Taka per section or side.
