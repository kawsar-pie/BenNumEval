The problem states that a large chocolate is split into eight equal pieces, with three pieces given to a friend, two pieces to a brother, and the remaining pieces kept for oneself. To determine what fraction of the entire chocolate I received, we can follow these steps:
2. First, calculate the total number of pieces the chocolate was divided into. This is given as 8 pieces.
3. Next, calculate how many pieces I was given by adding together the pieces given to my friend and brother: 3 (friend) + 2 (brother) = 5 pieces.
4. To find the fraction of the chocolate that I kept, divide the number of pieces I received by the total number of pieces (I kept for myself = pieces I received - pieces given): 8 (total pieces) - 5 (pieces received by others) = 3 (pieces I kept for myself).
5. Now, express this as a fraction: 3 (pieces I kept) / 8 (total pieces) = 3/8 of the chocolate.

""The cost of 18 eggs is 72 Takas. How much money is needed to buy 15 eggs of similar kind?""

2. Next, we need to determine the unit price (cost per egg) from the given information that 18 eggs cost 72 Takas. To do this, divide the total cost by the number of items:

Unit price per egg = Total cost / Number of eggs
= 72 / 18
= 4 Takas

3. Now, we can easily calculate how much money is needed to buy 15 similar type eggs using the same pricing rate, which has a unit price of 4 Takas:

Total cost for 15 eggs = Number of eggs * Unit price per egg
= 15 * 4

2. To solve this, we need to find two numbers whose sum is 147. Let's denote those numbers as x and y where x < y. We know that:
   - x + y = 147
   - y * 0.375 > (y/x) * 4

From the first equation, we can say x = 147 - y. Substituting this into our inequality formula:

- (147 - y) * 0.375 < 4 * (y/147) => -40.525 + 0.375*y < 4*(y/)

Solving this equation will provide values for x and y but we need to identify the smaller value which is x. Let's rearrange:

- 0.375x > -40.525 + 4(y)/147

2. To solve this problem, we need to understand that the ratios represent parts of a whole. The sum of the ratios' numbers (1 + 2 + 3) gives us the total number of equal parts.

Total parts = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

2. Let's denote the price of one bull as B and the total number of animals (bulls + goats) as N. According to the problem, N = 3 (goats) + 2 = 5; we know the combined price is Rs 45080.
3. The price of one goat is already given as Rs 4560, so if we let X represent the number of goats, then:
   Price of one goat * Number of goats (X) + Price of bulls * Number of bulls (Y or B) = Total price
   4560 * 3 + B * 2 = 45080
4. Solving for B:
   13680 + 2B = 45080
   Subtracting 13680 from both sides, we get:
   2B = 31400;

4. Solve the problem:
   - First, let's determine the equivalent work done by each person per day. Since Rajive, Devamgana, Masum, and Tajmara can perform a total of 150 mandis in 6 days, we must distribute the work equally among all four people. The number of parts performed by each person in one day combined is equal to that performed by the whole group in six days.
   - Let x represent the number of mandis worked per day per person:
     Total daily production = 150 / (6 people * x)
     x = 150 / (6 * 4)
     x = 25/2 = 12.5 mandis

The surface area of a triangular region is given in meters and the height is given in centimeters. First, we need to convert the heights to the same unit. Since there are 100 centimeters in a meter, let's convert the height: 
    Height = 15 m + 50 cm = 200 cm (since 15*100 cm = 1500 cm)

2. Now that both measurements are in the same unit (centimeters), we can calculate the surface area of a triangle: A = 1/2 * base * height
    In our case, the base is 24 meters (or 2400 centimeters), and the height is 200 cm. Therefore:
    Area = 1/2 * 2400 cm * 200 cm = 240000 square cm

3. Finally, we need to convert this value back into square meters since the question mentions the surface area in meters. There are 1 million square centimeters in a square meter (since there are 100 cm in a meter and 100^2 = 10000 for area).

""Mr. Ray, a government officer, is going on a pilgrimage tour in India. If a Bangladeshi Taka is equivalent to Indian Rupees at 0.63, then how many Bangladeshi Takas are needed for 3000 Indian Rupees?""
2. Solve the problem step by step:
First, we need to find out the conversion rate from Indian Rupees to Bangla Taka. According to the question, 1 Taka is equal to 0.63 Rupees. So, if we want to find out how many Takas are equivalent to 1 Rupee, we can divide 1 by 0.63. In mathematical terms, it would be:

1 ÷ (63/100) = 1 ÷ 0.63 ≈ 1.587 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, the conversion rate is approximately 1.58 Taka for 1 Rupee. Now, if we want to find out how many Takas are equivalent to 3000 Rupees, we simply multiply the number of Rupees by the conversion rate:

3000 × 1.587 ≈ 4760 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

So, approximately 4760 Takas are needed for 3000 Indian Rupees.

""There are three positive numbers. The product of the first and second number is 24, the product of the second and third number is 48, and the product of the first and third number is 32. What is the smallest number?""

2. Solve for the smallest number:
Let's denote the three numbers as A, B, and C (A < B < C). We have the following equations:

A * B = 24
B * C = 48
A * C = 32

We can see that C is common in both B * C = 48 and A * C = 32, so we can eliminate C first by dividing the second equation from the third:

(A * C) / (B * C) = 6/8

This simplifies to A/B = 3/4. Now since A is the smallest number and A < B, we know that A cannot be greater than 3 times smaller than B. Thus, A has to be a factor of 24 that is less than or equal to half of 24 (since B is twice bigger). The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. But since 4 * 3 = 12 < 24 and 3 * 4 > B * (A/B) = 16 > 24, the smallest number A must be such that A is a multiple of both 4 and 2 but less than or equal to half of 24.

A = 2, B = 12 (since A/B = 3/4), C = 24 (as per the first equation)

2. To solve this problem, let the two positive numbers be x and y, where x > y. We are given that x * y = 162 and x / y = 2.

From x/y = 2, we can express x in terms of y as x = 2y.

Now substitute x = 2y into the equation x*y = 162:
(2y)*y = 162
2y^2 = 162
Divide both sides by 2:
y^2 = 81
Take the square root of both sides:
y = 9

Since we defined x as 2y, now we substitute y=9 to find x:
x = 2*9
x = 18

The problem states that it would take 40 workers a total of 35 days to build a section of the Ishamati river during nightfall. We are asked to determine how many workers would be needed to complete the same section in 28 days.

2. Solve the mathematical calculation:
First, calculate the work done by one worker in one day (unit work): 1 unit = Work of one worker per day
Let's define: x represents the number of workers needed to build the section in 28 days after the first 35 days have already been completed.

Next, set up an equation based on the given information and the principle that work is equal to units (number of workers) multiplied by time.
Work = Units × Time
(40 workers * 35 days) = Work completed so far
Let x be the number of workers required to complete the rest in 28 days:
Unfinished work  = x workers * 28 days

Combining these two parts (total work and unfinished part):

40 workers * 35 days + x workers * 28 days = All the Work (A)
35 * 40 + 0.7x = A
1400 + 0.7xA = A
Now solve for A:
Let A represent the total work needed to build the section:
40 workers * 35 days = A
1400 workers-days = A

Plug this value of A into the equation:
1400 + 0.7x * 28 = 1400
0.7x * (4+3) = 400
2.8x = 400
Now, solve for x (number of workers needed to complete in next 28 days):
x = 400 / 2.8
x = 142.857143
Since the number of workers must be a whole number, round up or down depending on whether part work can be considered:
x ≈ 143 (assuming no part work is allowed)

2. Solution:
To find the depth of the water after the box is removed, we need to calculate the volume of the box and then determine how that volume affects the water level in the rectangular container.

First, let's find the volume of the box:
Volume = Length × Width × Height
        = 3 m × 2 m × 1 m
        = 6 cubic meters

Now, we need to convert the box's handle diameter (50 cm) into meters for consistency with the other units:
50 cm = 0.5 meters

The radius (r) of the handle is half the diameter:
r = 0.5 m / 2
r = 0.25 m

Next, we calculate the area of the base of the box when the water level drops because of the box's presence:
Area of the base = Length × Width
                 = 3 m × 2 m
                 = 6 square meters

Now, we need to find the height (h) that the box contributes to the water level. We use the formula for the volume of a cylinder (handle):
Volume of the cylinder = π × r² × h

We know the volume of the box is equal to the volume of the cylinder because both represent the space displaced by the presence of the handle:
6 cubic meters = π × (0.25 m)² × h

To find h, we divide the volume of the box by π and the square of the radius:
h = 6 / (π × 0.25²)
h ≈ 7853.98 meters (this value is much too large for our context—we must have made a mistake in calculation or assumption)

Redoing the formula with correct assumptions and calculations, we discover that the height of the box contributes to the water level:

2. Solution process:
   Let's denote the unknown number as \( X \).

The equation can be written and solved as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{6}{7} \times 3 \right) + X = \frac{26}{7}\].

First, calculate three times six-sevenths:
\[ 3 \times \frac{6}{7} = \frac{18}{7} \].

Then add the unknown \( X \):
\[\frac{18}{7} + X = \frac{26}{7}\].

To isolate \( X \), we subtract seventeen-sevenths from both sides:
\[ X = \frac{26}{7} - \frac{18}{7} \].

2. Let's denote the larger number as 'x'. Consequently, the smaller number would be 'x - 20', since the difference between the two numbers is given as 20.

3. The sum of these two numbers is provided as 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Let's denote the number of points the student scored in English as E and the number of points scored in Math as M. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The sum of scores in English and Math is 176: E + M = 176
2. The score in Math is 10 more than in English: M = E + 10

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of E:
E + (E + 10) = 176

Combine like terms:
2E + 10 = 176

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2E = 166

Divide both sides by 2 to find E:
E = 83

Now that we have E, we can find M using the second equation:
M = E + 10
M = 83 + 10
M = 93

So the student scored 93 points in Math.

2. We can observe from the problem statement that we need to find one certain unknown small number (let's call it x), where when added to 5320, the result must be a perfect square (i.e., a squared integer). To accomplish this, let us check whether the nearest perfect square around 5320 can serve our purpose.
3. To find the smallest such number x, first identify the two nearest perfect squares that are on either side of 5320. A good starting point to verify is checking integers from the square root of 5320 up and downwards until we find a match for the conditions.
4. First calculate the square root of 5320, which approximately equals 72.815 (not an integer), thus suggesting that it's neither the complete square of 72 nor 73. The largest perfect square less than 5320 is:
   \[ √(5320) = \text{round }(\sqrt{5320}) = 72 \]
   Therefore, the square number around it will be \( 73^2 = 5329 \).

5. To find x, subtract 5320 from 5329:
   \[ 5329 - 5320 = 9 \]
6. This implies if you add the smallest number 9 to 5320, it becomes a perfect square. 
    Verification: \( 5320 + 9 = 5329 \) and \( 73^2 = 5329 \).

Gita, Rita, and Mita together have Rs. 180. Rita's amount is 6 less than Gita's, and Mita has 12 more than Rita's amount. How much money does Mita have?

2. Let's denote the amount of money each girl has as follows:
- Gita = G
- Rita = R
- Mita = M

From the problem, we know three things:
- G + R + M = 180 (Total amount)
- R = G - 6 (Rita's amount is 6 less than Gita's)
- M = R + 12 (Mita's amount is 12 more than Rita's)

Substituting the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:
G + (G - 6) + ((G - 6) + 12) = 180
Combining like terms, we get:
3G + 6 = 180
Dividing by 3:
G = 60

Now we find Rita's amount, which is:
R = G - 6 = 54

M = R + 12 = 54 + 12

Translitigated Bengali problem in English: ""There is a rectangular garden with length and width being 60 meters and 40 meters respectively. Inside, there are railroad tracks 2 meters wide on all four sides. Find the area of these railroad tracks.""

2. Conclusion & Solution: The total side length of the garden including the railroad tracks would be (60 + 12) meters and (40 + 12) meters respectively due to the two meter railroad track on both ends of each dimension. This forms a square with side length 72 meters, because both dimensions are increased by twice the width of the rails, i.e., 60 + 12 = 72 and 40 + 12 = 52 (but this is incorrect).

   The correct area would be calculated on the actual dimensions increased by the rail width. This means the area covered by the railroad tracks and garden within it would be:

   Area of garden and rails = (60m x 40m) = 2400 sq. meter

   Now to calculate just the railroad's area, we can subtract the original garden dimensions from this result and then multiply by two since both sides are increased by rails:

   Area of rails only = 2 x [(60+12) x (40-4-12) + (60-12) x (40-4)]

   Therefore, the simplified solution steps:

   1. Increase garden length by twice 2 meters (rail width): (60 + 2*2) = 64 and for width it would be (40 - 2*2) = 36 (incorrect due to my earlier misunderstanding).
   2. The correct steps would be: (72 x 52) because rails are included on both directions along each dimension. 
   3. Final calculation of railroad tracks' area: Area of rails only would then be correct calculated on the corrected dimensions - and that should give us the area covered by just the rails in the garden.

This means the area covered by the railroad tracks and garden within it would be:\n\n   Area of garden and rails = (60m x 40m) = 2400 sq. meter\n\n   Now to calculate just the railroad\'s area, we can subtract the original garden dimensions from this result and then multiply by two since both sides are increased by rails:\n\n   Area of rails only = 2 x [(60+12) x (40-4-12) + (60-12) x (40-4)]\n\n   Therefore, the simplified solution steps:\n\n   1. Increase garden length by twice 2 meters (rail width): (60 + 2*2) = 64 and for width it would be (40 - 2*2) = 36 (incorrect due to my earlier misunderstanding).\n   2. The correct steps would be: (72 x 52) because rails are included on both directions along each dimension. \n   3. Final calculation of railroad tracks\' area: Area of rails only would then be correct calculated on the corrected dimensions - and that should give us the area covered by just the rails in the garden.\n\n   So after correcting earlier arithmetic oversight:\n\n      The total area remains same 2400 sq meters, but to answer specifically for rail', images=None, tool_calls=None)"

2. Solution: A leap year is a calendar year containing an extra day (or a leap day) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year. A year that isn't a leap year is called a common year and has 365 days.

   Since India gained independence on August 15, 1947, we need to count how many leap years occurred until the year 2014. Leap years follow a repeating pattern of 3 common years followed by 1 leap year.

The leap years till 2014 are:
- From 1956 to 2014, there are (2014 - 1956 + 1 = 59) leap years.

   The count doesn't include 1975 since it was not a leap year as per the Gregorian calendar rule which states that years divisible by 4 but NOT divisible evenly by 100 are leap years (with the exception of centurial years, which must also be divisible by 400).
   - 2000 was a leap year as it is both divisible by 4 and 400.

However, India's independence happened on August 15, 1947, and that means we don’t count the years preceding till then. So let's calculate correctly from there to 2014:

For leap years from 1948 (since '56 is divisible by 4) to 2014:
- From 1948, to avoid counting a leap year every 4 years twice and considering the rule for centurial years, we will only count whole blocks of 4 starting from 1948 up to 2015. Calculate the block: (2015 - 1948 + 1 = 68).
   Divide it by every next-block skipping-pattern as per the Gregorian rule (i.e., Leap years divide by 4):

2. To solve this problem, we first need to calculate Nasir Sahib's annual base salary. Since his monthly base salary is 27,650 Takas, we multiply that by 12 (the number of months in a year):
Annual Base Salary = Monthly Base Salary x Number of Months
Annual Base Salary = 27,650 Takas/Month x 12 Months
Annual Base Salary = 331,800 Takas

Next, we subtract the tax-exempt amount (two hundred fifty thousand Takas) from his annual base salary:
Taxable Income = Annual Base Salary - Tax-Exempt Amount
Taxable Income = 331,800 Takas - 250,000 Takas
Taxable Income = 81,800 Takas

Finally, we calculate the tax he has to pay by multiplying his taxable income by the tax rate (10 Takas):

Translate the Bengali problem into English: A fish seller buys a dozen eel fish for 1600 taka and sells each fish at 350 taka. What is his percentage loss or gain?
2. The solution can be derived by calculating the selling price of a dozen eel fish and comparing it to the cost price. The selling price per fish would be:
   1600 taka / (12 * 350) = 1.143
The percentage difference between the selling price and the cost price of the eel fish can then be calculated by:
   Percentage loss/gain = [Selling price - Cost price] / |Cost price|
                                  = [1600 taka - Selling price per fish * Number of fish] / 1600 taka
                                  = [(350 taka * 12) - 1600 taka] / 1600 taka
                                  = [4200 taka - 1600 taka]/1600 taka

""The product of two positive numbers is 147; the larger number is three times the smaller number. Find the value of the larger number.""

2. Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. According to the given conditions, we have:
   y = 3x (since the larger number is three times the smaller)
   y * x = 147 (since their product equals 147)

From equation (1), substitute y in equation (2):
   3x * x = 147
   3x^2 = 147
   x^2 = 147 / 3
   x^2 = 49
   Take the square root of both sides:
   x = $\sqrt{49}$

Monoyara Begum borrowed a certain amount of money at an interest rate of 6% and another amount at an interest rate of 4%. The total loan amount was 560,000 taka, and she earned a profit of 2840 taka in the end. If a 5% profit is taken on the entire loan, what is the annual profit?
2. Answer:
To find the annual profit, we need to determine how much was borrowed at each interest rate. Let's denote the amount borrowed at 6% as x taka and the amount borrowed at 4% as y taka. We know that the sum of these two amounts is the total loan, so:
x + y = 560,000 ... (Equation 1)
We also know that the profit earned was 2840 taka when the loans were settled. Assuming that the interest rates are annually compounded and the profits made from each amount respectively are equal to the total profit, we can write another equation as follows:
0.06x + 0.04y = 5% * 560,000 + 2840 ... (Equation 2)
But notice that by substituting x from Equation 1 into Equation 2 we would have two unknowns and need more equations to solve. However, the problem seems to provide all necessary data. This suggests we might be missing a crucial piece of information or assumption: namely, that the profits are not the direct consequence of the compounded interest rates but rather a lump sum that happens to match 5% interest on total principal.
Thus, let's rethink and simplify the situation. If Monoyara Begum earned a lump sum profit of 2840 taka, then regardless of the rates or amounts borrowed specifically, she had an overall annualized rate of 5% on her loan amount. Therefore, we can calculate her annual profit directly by:
(560,000 taka)*(5/100) = £28,000 taka
This gives the annualized profit as a direct consequence of the 5% interest rate she is being assumed to have applied to her total loan amount.

2. To find the GCD of these three numbers:
   - Firstly, we will use the Euclidean algorithm to derive the GCD of two numbers at a time, then utilize the result in association with the third number.
   - Calculate gcd(228, 342):
     i) We can say that $228 = 692 \times 0 + 342$ and since the remainder is zero, GCD(228, 342) = 342.ii) Similarly, $342 = 228 * 1 + 114 \ 114$ is the remainder.iii) $228 = 114 \times 2 + 0$, this implies that GCD(228, 342) or GCD(342, 114) = 114.

2. To calculate how much Rajdip earned, we follow these steps:

     $125 \times 2 = 250$ Takas
   - Determine the number of each type of item he was able to buy with his earnings:
     - Pencils: Since each pencil costs 5 Takas and he bought sets of two, we calculate how many sets of pencils he could buy. Thus, $250 \div (5 \times 2) = 25$ sets of pencils.
     - Notebooks: Since each notebook costs 20 Takas and he bought sets of two, we calculate how many sets of notebooks he could buy from the remaining money after buying pencils.

A rectangular container has a length of 3 meters, width of 2 meters, and height of 4 meters. How many kilograms of pure water can it hold?

To find out how many liters of pure water the container can hold, we need to calculate its volume (V) in cubic meters first:
= Length × Width × Height
= 3 m × 2 m × 4 m
= 24 cubic meters

1. Convert cubic meters to liters (since 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters):
Volume in liters = Volume in cubic meters × 1000
= 24 m³ × 1000
= 24,000 liters

Now that we have the volume of pure water in liters, we can use it to calculate how many kilograms of pure water (since the density of pure water is about 1 kg/L):

2. Let's denote the amount Dalim has by D. According to the problem, we know that S (amount for Sabuj) = (3/5)D because he received 3/5 of what Dalim had.
Now, Lingkon (L) got half of what Dalim got, so L=(1/2) * Dalim which is represented as D/2.
Given that the total money is 63,000, we can write this in equation format: D + S + L = 63,000.
Substituting our expressions for S and L in terms of D into the equation, we get: D + (3/5)D + (1/2)D = 63,000.
To solve this equation, let's first combine like terms:
(1+ 3/5 + 1/2) * D = 63,000 => (10/10 + 6/10 + 5/10) * D /2 D = 63,000.

Shyaml Chakma took a loan of 4500 Takas from a bank at an annual interest rate of 8%. We need to find out after how many years, the total interest earned would be 2520 Takas.

2. To solve this, we'll use the simple interest formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time.

3. Here, the principal is 4500 Takas, the interest rate is 8% or 0.08 when expressed as a decimal, and the total interest we want to find is 2520 Takas. We'll represent the number of years as 't'.

4. So, plugging in our values into the formula, we get: 2520 = 4500 × 0.08 × t

5. Solving for 't', we divide both sides by (4500 × 0.08) to isolate 't'. So, t = 2520 / (4500 × 0.08).

2. The problem in English is: ""If the annual profit percentage falls from 10% to 8%, how much less will be the profit for an investment of 3000 Takka over 3 years?""

To solve this problem, first, we need to calculate the difference in profit percentages:

Difference in profit percentage = New profit percentage - Old profit percentage
                              = 8% - 10%
                              = -2% (since it's a decrease)

Now, we need to find out how much less is the profit for an investment of 3000 Takka over 3 years. To do this, we can use the following formula:

Less Profit = Investment Amount * Decrease in Profit Percentage
                   = 3000 Takka * (-2%)
                   = -60 Takka (negative sign indicates less profit)

2. Solution:
To solve this problem, we first understand that the two consecutive numbers are x and (x+1). We're given two pieces of information here: 
    - Their sum of squares (g.s.a) equals 16, or, more formally, x^2 + (x+1)^2 = 16.

Firstly, we need to understand the compound interest formula. The final amount (A) can be calculated using the initial principal (P), the annual interest rate (r), and the time duration (n): A = P(1+r/n)^(nt).

2. In this problem, it is given that initially there was an investment of 6500 Taka where after one year the amount became (6500*1.2) or 7800 Taka due to compound interest. Similarly, after two years this has again increased becoming 6570 Taka, noticing here 6500*1.03^n = 6570 for n=2(time periods, annual).

3. With these informations, we are required to find out the principal amount (P) in 6500*1.2 and 6500*1.03^2 equation. So let's form two equations here:
    - Equation 1: P * 1.2 = 7800
    - Equation 2: P * (1.03^2) = 6570

4. Solving the first equation for P we get: P = 7800 / 1.2 = 6500 Taka.

""Ramiz Sahib deposited 50,000 taka in the bank and declared that he would not withdraw any money from the bank for the next 6 years. The annual interest rate of the bank is 10%. What will Ramiz's total assets be after 6 years?""

2. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the compound interest on the initial deposit over the given period.

The formula for compound interest is:
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, P = 50,000, r = 0.10 (as percentage), n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 6. So, A will be:
A = 50,000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*6)
A = 50,000(1 + 0.10)^6

""The annual profit increased from 8% to 10%, causing Tisha's investment to earn an additional 128 Takas over 4 years. What was her initial capital?""

2. Solution:
Let's denote Tisha's initial capital as `P`. The interest earned due to the annual profit increase can be expressed using the formula for compound interest, which is applicable when the interest rate changes after some time. In this case, we have two periods with different interest rates.

For the first period (2 years) at 8% interest:
Interest = P * r1 * t1 / 100
= P * 0.08 * 2

For the second period (2 years) at 10% interest:
Interest = P * r2 * t2 / 100
= P * 0.10 * 2

The total additional earnings after four years are given as 128 Takas. Hence, we equate the sum of interests for both periods to this amount:
(P * 0.08 * 2) + (P * 0.10 * 2) = 128

Solve the equation step-by-step:

P * 0.08 * 2 + P * 0.10 * 2 = 128

(0.16P + 0.20P) = 128
(0.36P) = 128
P = 128 / 0.36
P ≈ 355.5555556

Since the problem doesn't specify a context where fractions of Takas could be meaningful, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number.

In Tanbir's farm, there are 50 cows and 60 buffalos. If each buffalo gives birth to 2 calves annually, how many animals will be in Tanbir's farm after one year?

2. Let's calculate the number of new calves born:
Each buffalo gives birth to 2 calves annually, and there are 60 buffalos.
So, `New Born Animals = Buffalos * Calves per Buffalos`

Now, we know there were initially 50 cows and 60 buffalos in the farm. Adding these to the new born calves:
Total Animals = Initial Cows + Initial Buffalos + New Born Calves

2. First, we calculate the formula or equation based on the given condition. If placing an investment of \$13,000 for 5 years can double the money after yielding yearly percentage returns, it implies an annual growth multiple that is applied 5 times to achieve a doubling effect.

Translation of the problem: What is the difference between simple interest and compound interest earned on a principal amount of 5000 taka at an annual interest rate of 10% over a period of 3 years?
2. To solve this, first calculate the simple interest using the formula SI = PRT/100, where P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time:
   SI = 5000 * 10 * 3 / 100
   SI = 150 * 3
   SI = 450 taka.
   
3. Next, calculate the compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + R/n)^(nt), where n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year and T is the total number of years the money is invested:
   Since the problem doesn't specify whether interest is compounded annually or not, we'll assume it's compounded annually for simplicity. Hence n = 1.
   A = 5000(1 + 10/100)^3
   A = 5000(1 + 0.1)^3
   A = 5000 * 1.331
   A = 6655 taka.

There is a ledger and a pen, where the total cost of both items is 75 taka. If the price of the ledger is 5 taka less, and the price of the pen is 2 taka more than double the price of the ledger, what is the price of the ledger?

2. Let's denote the price of the ledger as L and the price of the pen as P.
We have two equations:
L + P = 75 (Total cost)
P = 2L + 2 (Price relation between pen and ledger if ledger is 5 taka cheaper)

Now substitute P from our second equation into the first one:
L + (2L + 2) = 75
3L + 2 = 75
Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate terms with L:
3L = 73
Divide by 3 to find L:
L = 73 / 3
L = 24.33 (approximately)

However, since the prices are given in whole taka, there should be no fractional part. This indicates that we assumed correctly and the ledger is indeed 5 taka cheaper. So:
L = 73 / 3 - 5/3
L = 68/3

   ""If a piece of fabric costing 25 meters is bought at a certain price, and then 20 meters of the same fabric is sold at that same price, what percentage profit or loss will be incurred?""

2. To solve this problem, we first need to understand that both buying and selling fabric involve the same cost per meter. Let's denote the cost per meter as C. Then, the total cost for 25 meters of fabric would be 25C, which is the amount you pay for it. When selling 20 meters of the same fabric at the same cost per meter, you earn 20C.

The profit made from this transaction would be:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = (20C) - (25C)
Profit = -5C

This indicates that there is a loss rather than a profit since the value is negative.

3. To find out the percentage of loss, we consider the cost price as 100%. The loss in rupees is proportional to the loss percentage:
Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) * 100%

2. To find the annual percentage interest (APR), we can use the simple interest formula:
   A = P(1 + rt)
   where:
   A = final amount (Rs 18,850)
   P = principal (initial investment)
   r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   t = number of years (8 years)

3. In this case, there is no initial principal mentioned, so we take the profit earned over 8 years as the final amount (A). The formula rearranges to find the annual interest rate:
   r = (A/P)^(1/t) - 1
    Since P cannot be determined from provided data, using such a direct method isn't feasible. However, you may use iterative or computational methods to estimate an initial investment which could have yielded the given profit within the mentioned period.
4. Considering another formula for interest, we can approximate it as:
   r = (Interest / Principal * Time)^(1/Time) - 1
    Plugging in approximate values, assuming Rs 50,000 were a plausible sum as the initial investment over this period:
   r = (18850 / 50000 * 8)^(1/8) - 1
    After calculations, the approximated annual interest rate (APR) would be approximately 3.6% in this case.

2. The given sum (S) and product (P) are 12 and 720 respectively. According to Vieta's Formulas (if we consider these numbers as roots of a quadratic equation), the sum of the roots is S/1= -b/a (where S=b/a), and their product is P=c/a.
   
3. To have an even number of solutions, both S and P must be positive. Since we are specifically looking for pairs of even numbers, they will follow the pattern (2n, 2m) where n,m are integers. That means -2(n+m)=12, hence n,m = -3 & 0; -1 & 1 etc...

4. We can set up an equation to solve: x*y = 720 and x + y = 12 where x and y are even numbers.
   
5. To find these numbers, we'd do prime factorization of P=720. Since it is even, divide by the smallest prime number that produces a non-zero integer. So dividing by 2 gives:
      -(1) (1st Iteration): 360 = 5 * 72; thus factors pairs are (15*48).
      -(2) (2nd): further breaking down of the factors can lead to a number of pairs, but we are to only find those even: (16*42, 24*30 etc...).
   
6. Continue this process until no more new factor pairs present themselves. The pairs found must add up to equal S=12 and multiply to P=720.

Conclusion: Considering these pair calculations and restrictions (both even, positive sum), the final answer would be determined by counting the number of such valid pairs. Please note that manual factorization may miss possible pairs due to length exhaustivity. However, through a software-based programmed approach, you can efficiently find all such pairs of even numbers from 720 without missing any possibilities.

That means -2(n+m)=12, hence n,m = -3 & 0; -1 & 1 etc...\n\n4. We can set up an equation to solve: x*y = 720 and x + y = 12 where x and y are even numbers.\n   \n5. To find these numbers, we\'d do prime factorization of P=720. Since it is even, divide by the smallest prime number that produces a non-zero integer. So dividing by 2 gives:\n      -(1) (1st Iteration): 360 = 5 * 72; thus factors pairs are (15*48).\n      -(2) (2nd): further breaking down of the factors can lead to a number of pairs, but we are to only find those even: (16*42, 24*30 etc...).\n   \n6. Continue this process until no more new factor pairs present themselves. The pairs found must add up to equal S=12 and multiply to P=720.\n\nConclusion: Considering these pair calculations and restrictions (both even, positive sum), the final answer would be determined by counting the number of such valid pairs. Please note that manual factorization may miss possible pairs due to length exhaustivity. However, through a software-based programmed approach, you can efficiently find all such pairs of even numbers from 720 without missing any possibilities.\n   \n**Answer: Count the pairs using method as illustrated', images=None, tool_calls=None)"

Translation: Each chocolate is sold at a cost of 8 Takas and is bought at 8.5 Taka. If the profit is 25 Takas, then how many chocolates were bought?

Now, let's analyze the problem, break it down, and solve step-by-step:

1. First, we need to determine the cost price (C) of each chocolate item. Since the chocolates are bought at 8 Takas as their selling price.
2. The total profit (P) for all chocolates is given as 25 Takas.
3. We also know the selling price (S) per chocolate, which is 8.50 Takas or Rs. 8 and Rs. 0.50 (which means a small difference of margin between the cost price and the selling price - Rs.0.50).
4. Since we don't have the cost price directly for each chocolate, let's assume that 'n' is the number of chocolates bought at cost of 8 Takas each. Therefore, total cost (TC) for 'n' number of chocolates would be: TC = n * 8.
5. The total selling price (TS) will then be: TS = n * S or TS = n * Rs. 8 and Rs. 0.50 which means the profit earned from each chocolate is included in this selling.
6. So, Total Cost (TC) + Profit (P) = Total Selling Price (TS). Given P is 25 Takas, so we can write: n*8 + 25 = n*S
7. Simplify the equation n * Rs.8 + Rs.25 = n*(Rs. 8+ Rs.0.50) => n* Rs. 0.50 = Rs. 25 => n = 0.50/(1/n) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1 * Rs.50;

Translation of the problem into English: ""We have three rods in our house with lengths of respectively 45 cm, 50 cm, and 75 cm. Calculate how many times each rod can completely measure a length of at least [undefined unit].""

2. To find out how many times each rod can fully measure a certain unknown length, we need to understand the context in which this is asked. Without additional information about what exactly needs to be measured or how precise the measurement needs to be, it's challenging to provide an appropriate English problem statement.

3. Assuming that ""কম্পক্ষে"" (at least) here implies a comparison of lengths that must fit within the length of each rod, then we must clarify what this unknown length is. Let’s suppose the question is asking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all three lengths so that we can find the longest length that still divides all three rods completely without any remainder.

4. To solve such a problem, we would calculate: `gcd(45, 50), gcd(50, 75), gcd(45, 75)`
   Using the Euclidean Algorithm:
      - gcd(45, 50):
        - 45 = 50 * 0 + 45, hence gcd is 45.
      - gcd(50, 75):
         -  75 = 50 * 1 + 25, hence gcd is 25.
      - gcd(45, 75):
        -  75 = 45 * 1 + 30, but 30 is not the GCD, because 45-1*30=15, and 15 is lesser and closer to half of any rod if rounded down. So gcd is actually 15.

Try to determine how many yellow buttons are left after each row of Sakir's square arrangement in his attempt to decorate with the remaining pieces.

2. Let's denote:
- Total number of yellow buttons (T) = 450
- Remaining yellow buttons (R) = 9
- Number of yellow button per row after arrangement (X) = ?

The problem can be solved by subtracting the total number of yellow button arranged in a square from the remaining button using an arithmetic sequence for arrangement. As the number of remaining buttons is 9, which means Sakir arranged 450 - 9 = 441 buttons in his square shape and there are 9 more buttons left than the remainder after arranging them.

Let S be Sakir's arrangement side length:
S^2 = 441

The value of s is not provided, neither does it affect our remaining yellow button calculation.
We can infer that for every set of X number of button per row, 9 are left over indicating a pattern we must adhere to while trying to understand and calculate the same:

3. We need to check if the remaining buttons fit proportionally with each other as they did when arranged in pairs or groups of another shape or structure that Sakir intended to use:
Number of button per row X = (T - R) / S
Since T=441 and R= 9, assuming perfect square arrangement where the remaining would also follow a square pattern. If we can't assume an integer X then we look for divisors/prime factors etc., of Remainder:
Since R doesn't fit any proper multiplier of a possible side length without leaving fraction which in context, is irrational (450 as whole not fitting into perfect squared arrangement). Therefore the pattern isn't following a true square or rectangle arrangement hence it remains an ambiguity without further info.

Translate the Bengali problem into English: A train travels at a speed of 30 km/h from Kolkata station to Narayanganj station, taking more than 10 minutes when covering a distance of 25 km. What is the total distance between the two stations?

2. First, find the time it takes to cover 25 km:
25 km / 30 km/h = 25/30 hours or 5/6 hour
Convert this to minutes: (5/6) * 60 minutes/hour = 50 minutes
Since it takes more than 10 minutes, the train also stops or slows down when covering a distance of 25 km. Therefore, the time taken to cover the next portion must be less than 10 minutes.

3. Given that the total travel time is 1 hour (60 minutes), and it took 50 minutes for the first 25 km, then the remaining journey time is:
60 minutes - 50 minutes = 10 minutes

4. Calculate the distance covered in the remaining 10 minutes at a constant speed of 30 km/h:
Distance = Speed * Time
= 30 km/h * (10/60) hours
= 30 * (1/6) km
= 5 km

5. Add the initial and remaining distances to find the total distance between the two stations: 25 km + 5 km = 30 km.

x + y = 18 and

y = 2*x - 6 (because half the smaller number is more than the larger by 6)

2. The capital profit relationship states that the capital is to its profit as the time period is to 1/5th of the interest rate or 8 per cent per annum. Therefore:
   - Profit = 5600 Taka
   - Interest Rate = 8%

First, find the total percentage of profit over the capital:
   - Calculate: \( \frac{Profit}{Interest \; Rate} = \frac{5600}{8} = 700 \) 

To find the actual time elapsed, calculate the time as the capital's portion of the profit divided by the capital’s proportion in the interest rate:
   - Thus: \( Time : Profit = 1 : (1/5 * 700) \), where 700 is the result we found from above.

3. If it costs $2.50 to repair one meter of the field's edges, what will be the total cost for repairing the whole field?

To find the total cost for repairing the field's edges, first determine the area of the rectangle by finding its dimensions given the cost and rate, then utilize those dimensions to calculate how much it would cost to fix one meter on four sides. 

1. To find the width of the rectangle:

$Width_{square\_meter} = \frac{Area_{total}}{Rate_{sow}}$ = $\frac{10260}{190}$ = $54$. So, the width is 54 meters (since square meter refers to any unit of area like a square of side length 54).

2. From that we can find the length:

$Length = Width\times1.5 = 54 \times 1.5 = 81.$

3. Now calculate the perimeter of the rectangle as follows, since four sides need to be repaired:

$Perimeter_{meters} = (2 * Length) + (2 * Width) = (2 \times 81) + (2 \times 54)$ = $306$ meters.

We are asked to find the smallest perfect square number that is divisible by both 25 and 60, after excluding zero. To solve this problem, we need to first identify numbers that meet these conditions separately and then determine their least common multiple (LCM), which is the answer to our initial query.

Firstly, calculate some multiples of each number:
Multiples of 25: 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, ... 
Multiples of 60: 0, 60, 120, 180, ...

The smallest number that is a multiple of both 25 and 60 must be a common multiple between these two sequences. The lowest such common multiple is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) we're looking for.

To find the LCM, we could:
1. Determine prime factors of 25 and 60.
2. List them in product form and identify duplicates.
3. Multiply unique factors together to obtain LCM.

Prime factorization of 25 = 5 × 5
Prime factorization of 60 = 2² × 3 × 5

So, the common factors are 5, and it occurs twice in both numbers. The remaining part of each number contributes to the overall multiplier: For 25 it is 'nothing', so only once. For 60, we take two twos (2²), one three (3), contributing a '2 × 3 = 6'.

2. Let's denote the total amount of money as 'T'. According to the given ratio (5 : 4 : 2), we can express the distribution of money for Labib (L), Sami (S), and Siaim (I) as follows:

   - Labib receives L = T/11 * 5
   - Sami receives S = T/11 * 4
   - Siaim receives I = T/11 * 2

Given that Siaim receives 180 Taka, we have the following equation:

T/11 * 2 = 180

T * 2 = 180 * 11

""Rojinaabibbi has built a house on her land covering 0.35 part and used 0.2 part of the remaining land for flower cultivation. Find out how much proportion of the land is being used for flower cultivation.""

2. Solution:

Let's assume the total land portion to be 1. Rojinaabibbi built her house covering 0.35 portion of it, which leaves 0.65 portion remaining (because 1 - 0.35 = 0.65). Out of this 0.65 portion, she used 0.2 part for flower cultivation. So, the total land portion used for flower cultivation would be:

Initial land portion without house + Flower cultivation portion

2. First, we need to find two perfect squares whose product is 1576. To do this, let's factorize 1576:
   1576 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 7^2

   So, one of the square factors could be (2^2 * 3^2) which equals to 36, and the other would be (7^2) which equals to 49.
   36 and 49 are both perfect squares (6^2 and 7^2 respectively).
   49 > 36, so 49 is the larger square factor.

Now, we know the larger square is 49, and it's 9/7 of a certain unknown number. So, let's represent this unknown number with 'x':

2. To solve this, we calculate:
   - The amount after the first year's compound interest, but before repayment: Rs. 5000 + (8% of Rs. 5000) = Rs. 5000 + Rs. 400 = Rs. 5400

2. Calculation: To find the smallest four-digit number divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all numbers in the group.

- 12's prime factors are: 2 * 2 * 3 = $4^2$ * 3
- 15's prime factors are: 5 * 3 = 5 * 3
- 20's prime factors are: 2 * 2 * 5 = $2^2$ * 5
- 35's prime factors are: 7 * 5
  
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:

- 2^2 (from 12 and 20) = 4
- 3^1 (from 12) = 3
- 5^1 (from 15 and 20) = 5
- 7^1 (from 35) = 7

Hence, the LCM of 12, 15, 20, and 35 is:
LCM = $4*3*5*7 = 420$

Now, we are looking for a four-digit number that is divisible by this LCM. Since 1000 is not divisible by 420, the next multiple of 420 after 1000 is:

1056 (i.e., $420*2 + 120$)
1470 (i.e., $420*3 + 210$)
1890 (i.e., $420*4 + 300$)
2310 (i.e., $420*5 + 420$)
