**1. Translation:**

The problem states: ""If the number of elements in a set is 3, what is the number of its proper subsets?""

**2. Solution:**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to determine the number of proper subsets:

*   **Understanding Subsets:** A subset is a set formed from the elements of the original set. It can include all the original elements, some of them, or none of them (the empty set).

*   **Understanding Proper Subsets:** A proper subset of a set is a subset that does *not* include all the elements of the original set.  In other words, it's any subset except the set itself.

*   **Calculating the Total Number of Subsets:** The number of subsets of a set with *n* elements is 2<sup>*n*</sup>.

*   **Calculating the Number of Proper Subsets:** The number of proper subsets is the total number of subsets minus 1 (because we exclude the set itself).  Therefore, the number of proper subsets is 2<sup>*n*</sup> - 1.

*   **Applying to the problem:** In this problem, the set has 3 members (n=3). Therefore the number of proper subsets is 2<sup>3</sup> - 1.

*   **Calculation:** 2<sup>3</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
Therefore, the number of proper subsets is 8 - 1 = 7.

**1. Translation to English:**

When 5 grams of hydrogen gas is passed through 1.27 x 10^24 chlorine atoms, what mass of chlorine gas was present?

**2. Solution:**

Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

*   **Step 1: Understanding the Reaction**

Hydrogen gas (H₂) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl₂) to form hydrogen chloride gas (HCl). The balanced chemical equation is:

H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl
* **Step 2: Calculating moles of hydrogen gas**

The molar mass of H₂ is approximately 2 g/mol.
Moles of H₂ = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 2 g/mol = 2.5 mol

*   **Step 3: Calculating moles of chlorine atoms and then chlorine gas**

We are given the number of chlorine atoms. First, we need to convert this to moles of chlorine atoms. We know that 1 mole contains Avogadro's number of particles (6.022 x 10^23).

Moles of Cl atoms = (1.27 x 10^24 atoms) / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) ≈ 2.11 moles

Since chlorine exists as a diatomic molecule (Cl₂), 2 moles of chlorine atoms is equal to 1 mole of chlorine gas.

Therefore, Moles of Cl₂ gas = (moles of Cl atoms)/2 = 2.11/2 ≈ 1.055 moles.

*   **Step 4: Determining the Limiting Reactant**

From the balanced chemical equation (H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl), 1 mole of H₂ reacts with 1 mole of Cl₂. We need to determine the limiting reactant.

We have 2.5 moles of H₂ and 1.055 moles of Cl₂.  Since we have less Cl₂, it acts as a limiting reactant. Thus, only 1.055 moles of H2 will react with 1.055 moles of Cl2 and 1.445 moles of H2 gas will be left unreacted.

*   **Step 5: Calculating the mass of chlorine gas**

Tickets numbered consecutively from 1 to 10 are shuffled thoroughly. A ticket is then drawn at random. What is the probability that the ticket has a number that is a multiple of 2 or 3?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

*   **Identify the Sample Space:** The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes, which in this case are the numbers on the tickets. The sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The total number of possible outcomes is 10.

*   **Identify the Favorable Outcomes (Multiples of 2):** The multiples of 2 within the sample space are {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. There are 5 multiples of 2.

*   **Identify the Favorable Outcomes (Multiples of 3):** The multiples of 3 within the sample space are {3, 6, 9}. There are 3 multiples of 3.

*   **Identify the Overlapping Outcomes (Multiples of Both 2 and 3):**  The multiples of both 2 and 3 are multiples of their least common multiple, which is 6. The multiples of 6 within the sample space are {6}. There is 1 multiple of both 2 and 3.

*   **Calculate the Total Number of Favorable Outcomes:**  To find the total number of outcomes that are multiples of 2 or 3, we add the number of multiples of 2 and the number of multiples of 3, and then subtract the number of multiples of both (to avoid double counting).
    Total favorable outcomes = (Multiples of 2) + (Multiples of 3) - (Multiples of both 2 and 3)
    Total favorable outcomes = 5 + 3 - 1 = 7

*   **Calculate the Probability:** The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
    Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

**1. Translation:**

The problem states: If 17.75 grams of Sodium Sulfate are dissolved in 450 ml of solution, what is the concentration of the solution?

**2. Solution:**

To find the concentration of the solution, we need to determine the mass of solute (Sodium Sulfate) per unit volume of solution.  We can express the concentration in grams per liter (g/L).

* **Step 1: Convert volume from ml to L:**

We are given the volume in milliliters (ml) and need to convert it to liters (L).  We know that 1 L = 1000 ml.

Volume in liters = 450 ml * (1 L / 1000 ml) = 0.45 L

* **Step 2: Calculate the concentration in g/L:**

Concentration = (Mass of solute) / (Volume of solution)

Concentration = 17.75 g / 0.45 L

Concentration = 39.444... g/L

A cow is tied with a rope in such a way that it can graze grass in a circular field of 144 square meters. What is the diameter of the field in meters?

**2. Solution:**

The problem states that the cow can graze in a circular field with an area of 144 square meters.  We need to find the diameter of this circular field.

*   **Formula for the area of a circle:** The area (A) of a circle is given by the formula  A = πr², where 'r' is the radius of the circle, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.

*   **Finding the radius:** We know the area A = 144 square meters. We can rearrange the formula to solve for 'r':

    r² = A / π
    r² = 144 / π

    Since the problem does not give us a value for pi, we'll assume π = 3.1416 will suffice.

    r² = 144 / 3.1416 = 45.8366

    r = √45.8366 ≈ 6.77 meters

A wheel rotates 25 times to cover a distance of 3.25 km. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Convert the distance to meters.**

    The distance covered is 3.25 km.  Since 1 km = 1000 meters, we can convert it as follows:

    Distance = 3.25 km * 1000 meters/km = 3250 meters

*   **Step 2: Calculate the circumference of the wheel.**

    In 25 rotations, the wheel covers 3250 meters. Therefore, in one rotation (which is the circumference of the wheel), it covers:

    Circumference = Total distance / Number of Rotations
    Circumference = 3250 meters / 25 = 130 meters

*   **Step 3: Calculate the diameter of the wheel.**

    The circumference of a circle is given by the formula:

    Circumference = π * Diameter

    Where π (pi) is approximately 3.14159. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the diameter:

    Diameter = Circumference / π

    Diameter = 130 meters / π  ≈ 130 / 3.14159 ≈ 41.3803 meters

*   **Step 4: Round to a reasonable number of decimal places.**

    Rounding to two decimal places (since it's appropriate for this kind of measurement), the diameter is approximately equal to 41.38 meters.

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem ""তুঁতের এক অণুতে যুক্ত পানির ভর কত?"" translates to: ""What is the mass of water molecules associated with one molecule of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄.5H₂O)?""  ""Tute"" refers to copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate.

**2. Solution:**

Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate has the chemical formula CuSO₄.5H₂O. This indicates that for every one molecule of copper sulfate (CuSO₄), there are five molecules of water (H₂O) associated with it. To find the mass of the water associated with one molecule of CuSO₄.5H₂O, we need to calculate the mass of 5 water molecules.

*   **Molar mass of water (H₂O):**
    *   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 g/mol
    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of H₂O = (2 * 1) + 16 = 18 g/mol

*   **Mass of 5 water molecules:**

Since we are considering one mole of CuSO₄.5H₂O, and there are 5 moles of water per mole of the compound, we need to calculate the combined molar mass of 5 water molecules.

Mass of 5 H₂O molecules = 5 * (Molar mass of H₂O) = 5 * 18 g/mol = 90 g/mol.

Since the problem asks about the mass associated with *one molecule*, we can think of the answer in terms of atomic mass units (amu). So, one molecule of CuSO₄.5H₂O is comprised of one CuSO₄ molecule and five H₂O molecules. The mass of 5 water molecules is 5 * the mass of one water molecule. Mass of one water molecule is about 18 amu, so the mass of 5 water molecules is 5*18 = 90 amu.

1. **Translation:** What is the percentage of chlorine in chloric acid?

2. **Solution:**

   *   **Step 1: Chemical Formula of Chloric Acid**

       The chemical formula for chloric acid is  HClO<sub>3</sub>.

   *   **Step 2: Atomic Masses**

       We need the atomic masses of each element present in the compound:

       *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu (atomic mass unit)
       *   Chlorine (Cl): 35.5 amu
       *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu

   *   **Step 3: Molecular Mass of Chloric Acid**

       Calculate the molecular mass (also known as molar mass) of HClO<sub>3</sub>:

       Molecular Mass = (1 × Atomic Mass of H) + (1 × Atomic Mass of Cl) + (3 × Atomic Mass of O)

       Molecular Mass = (1 × 1) + (1 × 35.5) + (3 × 16)

       Molecular Mass = 1 + 35.5 + 48

       Molecular Mass = 84.5 amu

   *   **Step 4: Mass of Chlorine in One Mole of Chloric Acid**

       In one molecule of HClO<sub>3</sub>, there is one atom of chlorine. Therefore, the mass of chlorine is 35.5 amu.

   *   **Step 5: Calculate the Percentage of Chlorine**

       Percentage of Chlorine = (Mass of Chlorine / Molecular Mass of HClO<sub>3</sub>) × 100

       Percentage of Chlorine = (35.5 / 84.5) × 100

       Percentage of Chlorine ≈ 41.99%

2. **Solution:**

First, we need to find the total height the boy climbed.

*   Height of each step = 16 cm = 0.16 meters (Conversion from cm to meters)
*   Number of steps = 20
*   Total height climbed (h) = height of each step * number of steps = 0.16 m * 20 = 3.2 meters

Now, we can calculate the work done by the boy against gravity.

*   Mass of the boy (m) = 40 kg
*   Acceleration due to gravity (g) = approximately 9.8 m/s²
*   Work done (W) = Potential Energy gained = m * g * h

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem translates to: ""What is the amount of work done (in Joules) when an object tied to a string is rotated once in a vertical plane?""

**2. Solution:**

When an object attached to a string is rotated in a vertical plane, the work done by gravity over one complete revolution is zero. Here's why:

*   **Work and Force:** Work is done when a force causes displacement of an object in the direction of the force. Mathematically, work (W) = Force (F) * Displacement (d) * cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the force and the displacement vectors.
*   **Gravity as the Force:** In this case, the force acting on the object is gravity (weight of the object, *mg*, where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity).
*   **Vertical Circular Motion:** As the object moves in the vertical circle, gravity acts downwards.
*   **Work Done in Upward Motion:** When the object is moving upwards (against gravity), the work done by gravity is negative (gravity opposes the displacement).
*   **Work Done in Downward Motion:** When the object is moving downwards (in the direction of gravity), the work done by gravity is positive (gravity aids the displacement).
*   **Complete Revolution:** Over one complete revolution, the object returns to its starting point.  The total vertical displacement is zero. Therefore, the net work done by gravity is zero.  Another way to visualize this is that the work done lifting the object to the highest point of the circle is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the work done as the object falls back down to the starting point. The positive and negative work cancel out.

Since the only force doing work is gravity, and the net work done by gravity is zero, the total work done is zero Joules.

249.5 grams of blue vitriol was heated and 150 grams of white powder was obtained. What is the percentage yield of the product?

**2. Solution:**

Blue vitriol is hydrated copper(II) sulfate, CuSO₄·5H₂O. The white powder obtained upon heating is anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, CuSO₄. The problem asks us to find the percentage yield.

*   **Step 1: Understand the Reaction**
    The reaction is the dehydration of blue vitriol:

    CuSO₄·5H₂O  →  CuSO₄ + 5H₂O

*   **Step 2: Calculate the molar mass of CuSO₄·5H₂O and CuSO₄**

    *   Molar mass of CuSO₄·5H₂O = 63.5 (Cu) + 32 (S) + 4 * 16 (O) + 5 * (2 * 1 + 16) (H₂O)
                                        = 63.5 + 32 + 64 + 5 * 18
                                        = 63.5 + 32 + 64 + 90
                                        = 249.5 g/mol

    *   Molar mass of CuSO₄ = 63.5 (Cu) + 32 (S) + 4 * 16 (O)
                                  = 63.5 + 32 + 64
                                  = 159.5 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the theoretical yield of CuSO₄**
    If we start with 249.5g of CuSO₄·5H₂O (which is 1 mol), the theoretical yield of CuSO₄ should be the number of moles times its molar mass.

    Since 1 mol of CuSO₄·5H₂O produces 1 mol of CuSO₄, theoretically 249.5 g of  CuSO₄·5H₂O should yield 159.5 g of CuSO₄.

**English:** 50 grams of fluorine are passed through 4 grams of hydrogen gas. What amount of hydrogen will react with the fluorine in the reaction?

**2. Solution:**

To determine the amount of hydrogen that reacts with fluorine, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the stoichiometry involved. The reaction between hydrogen and fluorine produces hydrogen fluoride.

The balanced chemical equation is:

H₂ (g) + F₂ (g) → 2HF (g)

This equation tells us that one mole of hydrogen gas (H₂) reacts with one mole of fluorine gas (F₂) to produce two moles of hydrogen fluoride (HF).

Now, let's calculate the molar masses of H₂ and F₂:

*   Molar mass of H₂ = 2 * 1.008 g/mol ≈ 2 g/mol
*   Molar mass of F₂ = 2 * 19.00 g/mol = 38 g/mol

Next, we need to determine the number of moles of fluorine and hydrogen present:

*   Moles of F₂ = mass of F₂ / molar mass of F₂ = 50 g / 38 g/mol ≈ 1.316 mol
*   Moles of H₂ = mass of H₂ / molar mass of H₂ = 4 g / 2 g/mol = 2 mol

Now, identify the limiting reactant. The limiting reactant is the one that will be completely consumed and determine the amount of product formed.  From the balanced equation, 1 mole of H₂ reacts with 1 mole of F₂.  Therefore, the mole ratio of H₂ to F₂ is 1:1.

Since we have 1.316 moles of F₂ and 2 moles of H₂, fluorine is the limiting reactant (because if all the fluorine were used up, only 1.316 moles of H₂ would be required, which is less than the 2 that is available ).  Thus, the amount of hydrogen that reacts is determined by the"

**1. Translation:**

The sum of two angles is 60 degrees and their difference is 30 degrees. What is the measure of the larger angle in degrees?

**2. Solution:**

Let the two angles be *x* and *y*, where *x* is the larger angle and *y* is the smaller angle.

We are given the following information:

*   *x* + *y* = 60  (The sum of the two angles is 60 degrees)
*   *x* - *y* = 30  (The difference of the two angles is 30 degrees)

We can solve this system of two equations with two variables.  One way to do this is by adding the two equations together:

( *x* + *y* ) + ( *x* - *y* ) = 60 + 30

This simplifies to:

2*x* = 90

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for *x*:

*x* = 90 / 2

*x* = 45

Now that we have found *x*, we can find *y* by substituting the value of *x* into either of the original equations.  Let's use the first equation:

*x* + *y* = 60

45 + *y* = 60

Subtract 45 from both sides to solve for *y*:

*y* = 60 - 45

*y* = 15

Since *x* = 45 and *y* = 15, the larger angle is 45 degrees.

""What amount of sodium carbonate is present in 2 liters of a 0.2 molar sodium carbonate solution?""

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

*   **Understanding Molarity:** Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

*   **Formula:**  Molarity (M) = Moles of solute / Liters of solution

*   **Given Values:**
    *   Volume of solution = 2 Liters
    *   Molarity of solution = 0.2 Molar

*   **Calculate Moles of Sodium Carbonate (Na₂CO₃):**

    Rearrange the formula to solve for moles of solute:

    Moles of solute = Molarity (M) × Liters of solution

    Moles of Na₂CO₃ = 0.2 M × 2 L = 0.4 moles

*   **Calculate the Molar Mass of Sodium Carbonate (Na₂CO₃):**

    *   Na (Sodium): 2 × 23 g/mol = 46 g/mol
    *   C (Carbon): 1 × 12 g/mol = 12 g/mol
    *   O (Oxygen): 3 × 16 g/mol = 48 g/mol

    Molar mass of Na₂CO₃ = 46 + 12 + 48 = 106 g/mol

*   **Calculate the Mass of Sodium Carbonate:**

    Mass = Moles × Molar mass

    Mass of Na₂CO₃ = 0.4 moles × 106 g/mol = 42.4 g

The question asks: 12 grams of Magnesium will react with how many grams of Oxygen?

**2. Solution:**

This problem requires understanding the stoichiometry of the reaction between Magnesium (Mg) and Oxygen (O₂) to form Magnesium Oxide (MgO).

*   **Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation:**

    The unbalanced equation is: Mg + O₂ → MgO

    To balance this equation, we need two moles of Mg and two moles of MgO.

    The balanced equation is: 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

*   **Step 2: Determine the molar masses of the reactants involved (Mg and O₂):**

    *   Molar mass of Mg ≈ 24 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 32 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Interpret the balanced equation in terms of molar masses:**

    The balanced equation 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO tells us that 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O₂.  Therefore, 2 * 24 g of Mg reacts with 32 g of O₂.  Which simplifies to 48 g of Mg reacts with 32 g of O₂.

*   **Step 4: Set up a proportion to find the mass of O₂ that reacts with 12 g of Mg:**

    We know that 48 g of Mg reacts with 32 g of O₂.  We want to find out how much O₂ (let's call it 'x') reacts with 12 g of Mg. Therefore, we can write the proportion:

    48 g Mg / 32 g O₂ = 12 g Mg / x g O₂

*   **Step 5: Solve for 'x':**

    Cross-multiplying, we get:

    48 * x = 12 * 32

    48x = 384

    x = 384 / 48

    x = 8

Therefore, 12 grams of Magnesium will react with 8 grams of Oxygen.

A mountain subtends an angle of 7 degrees at a point 450 kilometers away. What is the height of the mountain in meters?

**2. Solution:**

We can visualize this problem as a right-angled triangle, where:

*   The distance to the mountain (450 km) is the adjacent side to the angle.
*   The height of the mountain (what we want to find) is the opposite side to the angle.
*   The angle is 7 degrees.

We can use the tangent function to relate these quantities:

tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent

In our case:

tan(7°) = height / 450 km

First, let's convert the distance to meters:

450 km = 450 * 1000 meters = 450,000 meters

Now, we can solve for the height:

height = tan(7°) * 450,000 meters

We need to find the value of tan(7°). We can use a calculator for this:

tan(7°) ≈ 0.12278

Now, plug this value back into the equation:

height ≈ 0.12278 * 450,000 meters

height ≈ 55251 meters

""What is the value of acceleration due to gravity at a height of 500 km above the Earth's surface? The mass of the Earth is 5.98 x 10^24 kg and the radius of the Earth is 6.37 x 10^6 meters.""

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we'll use the following formula for the acceleration due to gravity at a height 'h' above the Earth's surface:

g' = GM / (R + h)^2

Where:

*   g' = acceleration due to gravity at height h
*   G = Gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 N m^2/kg^2)
*   M = Mass of the Earth (5.98 x 10^24 kg)
*   R = Radius of the Earth (6.37 x 10^6 m)
*   h = Height above the Earth's surface (500 km = 5 x 10^5 m)

Now, let's plug in the values:

g' = (6.674 x 10^-11 N m^2/kg^2 * 5.98 x 10^24 kg) / (6.37 x 10^6 m + 5 x 10^5 m)^2

First, let's simplify the denominator:

R + h = 6.37 x 10^6 m + 0.5 x 10^6 m = (6.37 + 0.5) x 10^6 m = 6.87 x 10^6 m

Now, square the denominator:

(6.87 x 10^6 m)^2 = 47.1969 x 10^12 m^2 = 4.71969 x 10^13 m^2

Now, calculate the numerator:

**1. Translation:**

A circle has a radius of 10 cm. What is the measure in degrees of the central angle subtended by an arc of length 35 cm?

**2. Solution:**

We need to find the central angle subtended by an arc of length 35 cm in a circle with a radius of 10 cm.  We can use the formula relating arc length (s), radius (r), and the central angle in radians ($\theta$):

*   s = r * $\theta$

First, we find the central angle in radians:

*   $\theta$ = s / r
*   $\theta$ = 35 cm / 10 cm
*   $\theta$ = 3.5 radians

Now, we need to convert radians to degrees.  We know that $\pi$ radians = 180 degrees. Therefore, 1 radian = (180/$\pi$) degrees.

*   Central angle in degrees = 3.5 radians * (180/$\pi$) degrees/radian
*   Central angle in degrees $\approx$ 3.5 * (180 / 3.14159)
*   Central angle in degrees $\approx$ 3.5 * 57.2958
*   Central angle in degrees $\approx$ 200.5353 degrees

A bullet of mass 10 grams is fired from a gun with a velocity of 400 m/s. If the mass of the gun is 3/2 kg, what is the recoil velocity of the gun in m/s?

**2. Step-by-step Solution with Explanation:**

This problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of momentum. According to this principle, the total momentum of a system remains constant if no external force acts on it. In this case, the system is the gun and the bullet.

*   **Initial Momentum:** Before the gun is fired, both the gun and the bullet are at rest. Therefore, the initial momentum of the system is 0.

*   **Final Momentum:** After the gun is fired, the bullet moves forward, and the gun recoils backward. Let's denote:
    *   `m_b` = mass of the bullet = 10 grams = 0.01 kg (converting to kg)
    *   `v_b` = velocity of the bullet = 400 m/s
    *   `m_g` = mass of the gun = 3/2 kg = 1.5 kg
    *   `v_g` = recoil velocity of the gun (what we want to find)

    The momentum of the bullet is `m_b * v_b` and the momentum of the gun is `m_g * v_g`.
    The total final momentum of the system is `m_b * v_b + m_g * v_g`.

*   **Conservation of Momentum Equation:**
    Since the initial momentum is equal to the final momentum:
    `0 = m_b * v_b + m_g * v_g`

*   **Solving for v_g:**

    `m_g * v_g = -m_b * v_b`

    `v_g = - (m_b * v_b) / m_g`

    Plugging in the values:

    `v_g = - (0.01 kg * 400 m/s) / 1.5 kg`

    `v_g = - 4 / 1.5 m/s"

50 grams of fluorine gas is passed through 4 grams of hydrogen gas. What is the volume of hydrogen gas that reacted in the reaction at standard conditions (STP)?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

*   **Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:**

    The reaction between fluorine (F₂) and hydrogen (H₂) produces hydrogen fluoride (HF). The balanced equation is:

    F₂(g) + H₂(g) → 2HF(g)

*   **Calculate the number of moles of fluorine (F₂) and hydrogen (H₂):**

    Molar mass of F₂ = 2 * 19 g/mol = 38 g/mol
    Moles of F₂ = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 38 g/mol ≈ 1.316 mol

    Molar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol
    Moles of H₂ = mass / molar mass = 4 g / 2 g/mol = 2 mol

*   **Determine the limiting reactant:**

    From the balanced equation, 1 mole of F₂ reacts with 1 mole of H₂.
    We have 1.316 moles of F₂ and 2 moles of H₂.  Since the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, fluorine is the limiting reactant because we have less of it relative to the balanced equation's requirement.  Therefore, only 1.316 moles of H₂ will react.

*   **Calculate the volume of hydrogen gas reacted at STP:**

    At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.
    Volume of H₂ reacted = moles of H₂ reacted * volume per mole at STP
    Volume of H₂ reacted = 1.316 mol * 22.4 L/mol ≈ 29.4784 L

Here's how to solve this problem:

*   **Understanding Molarity:** Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  So, a 0.2 M solution contains 0.2 moles of solute in 1 liter (1000 ml) of solution.

*   **Step 1: Convert volume to liters:**
    We have 250 ml of solution.  To convert this to liters, we divide by 1000:
    Volume in liters = 250 ml / 1000 ml/L = 0.25 L

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of NaCl:**
    Since we know the molarity and the volume in liters, we can calculate the number of moles of NaCl:
    Moles of NaCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
    Moles of NaCl = 0.2 M * 0.25 L = 0.05 moles

*   **Step 3: Calculate the mass of NaCl:**
    To convert moles to grams, we need the molar mass of NaCl. The molar mass of Na (Sodium) is approximately 23 g/mol, and the molar mass of Cl (Chlorine) is approximately 35.5 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of NaCl is 23 + 35.5 = 58.5 g/mol.

    Mass of NaCl = Moles of NaCl * Molar mass of NaCl
    Mass of NaCl = 0.05 moles * 58.5 g/mol = 2.925 g

To solve this problem, we need to know the following:

*   **Molar Volume at STP:** At standard temperature and pressure (STP: 0°C or 273.15 K and 1 atm pressure), one mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters.
*   **Molar Mass of Chlorine Gas (Cl₂):** The atomic mass of Chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.5 g/mol. Since chlorine gas exists as a diatomic molecule (Cl₂), its molar mass is 2 * 35.5 g/mol = 71 g/mol.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1.  **Find the number of moles of Chlorine gas:**

A coin is tossed 720 times, and heads appear 480 times. What is the relative frequency of heads?

**2. Solution:**

The relative frequency of an event is the number of times the event occurs divided by the total number of trials.  In this case:

*   The event is getting ""heads"".
*   The number of times ""heads"" occurs is 480.
*   The total number of trials (coin tosses) is 720.

Therefore, the relative frequency of heads is:

Relative Frequency = (Number of times heads appears) / (Total number of tosses)
Relative Frequency = 480 / 720

Now, simplify the fraction:

480/720 = (48 * 10) / (72 * 10) = 48/72

A 5 kg object is dropped from the roof of a 50-meter-high building. What will be the kinetic energy of the object in Joules just before it touches the ground?

**2. Solution:**

This problem can be solved using the conservation of energy principle.  We can assume that all the potential energy the object has at the top of the building is converted into kinetic energy just before it hits the ground (ignoring air resistance).

*   **Potential Energy (PE) at the top:**

    PE = mgh

    where:

    *   m = mass of the object (5 kg)
    *   g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)
    *   h = height of the building (50 m)

*   **Kinetic Energy (KE) at the bottom (just before impact):**

    Since we're assuming all potential energy is converted to kinetic energy:

    KE = PE

    Therefore, KE = mgh

Now, let's plug in the values:

KE = (5 kg) * (9.8 m/s²) * (50 m)

""What is the molar volume of 7 grams of nitrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?""

**2. Step-by-step Solution with explanations in English:**

*   **Understanding the Concepts:**

    *   **Molar Volume:** The molar volume of a gas is the volume occupied by one mole of that gas. At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), the molar volume of any ideal gas is approximately 22.4 liters per mole (or 22.4 dm<sup>3</sup>/mol, which is equivalent).
    *   **STP Conditions:** Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) are defined as 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atmosphere (atm) pressure.
    *   **Nitrogen Gas:** Nitrogen exists as a diatomic molecule, N<sub>2</sub>. We need to consider this when calculating the number of moles.
    *   **Molar mass of N<sub>2</sub>:**  The atomic mass of Nitrogen (N) is approximately 14 g/mol.  Therefore, the molar mass of N<sub>2</sub> is 2 * 14 = 28 g/mol.

*   **Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>).**

    We are given the mass of nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) as 7 grams.
    Number of moles (n) = mass / molar mass
    n = 7 g / 28 g/mol

A coin is tossed three times. What is the probability of getting heads more times than tails?

**2. Solution:**

Let's analyze the possible outcomes of tossing a coin three times.  Each toss has two possibilities: Heads (H) or Tails (T).  Therefore, there are 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 possible outcomes.  We can list them all:

*   HHH
*   HHT
*   HTH
*   THH
*   HTT
*   THT
*   TTH
*   TTT

We need to find the outcomes where Heads (H) appears more times than Tails (T).  Let's examine each outcome:

*   **HHH:** Heads = 3, Tails = 0. Heads > Tails. (Favorable)
*   **HHT:** Heads = 2, Tails = 1. Heads > Tails. (Favorable)
*   **HTH:** Heads = 2, Tails = 1. Heads > Tails. (Favorable)
*   **THH:** Heads = 2, Tails = 1. Heads > Tails. (Favorable)
*   **HTT:** Heads = 1, Tails = 2. Heads < Tails. (Not Favorable)
*   **THT:** Heads = 1, Tails = 2. Heads < Tails. (Not Favorable)
*   **TTH:** Heads = 1, Tails = 2. Heads < Tails. (Not Favorable)
*   **TTT:** Heads = 0, Tails = 3. Heads < Tails. (Not Favorable)

There are 4 favorable outcomes (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes.

The probability is calculated as (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Possible Outcomes).

The question asks: ""-80.65 degrees Celsius is equal to how many degrees Fahrenheit?""

**2. Solution:**

To convert Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F), we use the following formula:

°F = (°C * 9/5) + 32

Given that the temperature in Celsius is -80.65 °C, we can substitute this value into the formula:

°F = (-80.65 * 9/5) + 32

First, we multiply -80.65 by 9/5:

-80.65 * 9/5 = -80.65 * 1.8 = -145.17

Now, we add 32 to the result:

-145.17 + 32 = -113.17

Therefore, -80.65 degrees Celsius is equal to -113.17 degrees Fahrenheit.

For the production of hydrochloric acid, 1 gram of hydrogen is mixed with 70 grams of chlorine. How many grams of chlorine will be leftover/remain?

**2. Step-by-step Solution with Explanation:**

*   **Chemical Reaction:** The reaction between hydrogen and chlorine to form hydrochloric acid is:

    H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl

*   **Molar Masses:** The molar mass of hydrogen (H₂) is approximately 2 g/mol (2 x 1 g/mol). The molar mass of chlorine (Cl₂) is approximately 71 g/mol (2 x 35.5 g/mol).

*   **Stoichiometry:** From the balanced equation, 2 grams of hydrogen react with 71 grams of chlorine.

*   **Calculating Chlorine Required for 1 gram of Hydrogen:** We are given that 1 gram of hydrogen is used. We need to find out how much chlorine is required to completely react with 1 gram of hydrogen.

    Since 2 grams of H₂ react with 71 grams of Cl₂, then 1 gram of H₂ will react with (71/2) grams of Cl₂.

    Chlorine required = 71/2 = 35.5 grams

*   **Calculating Excess Chlorine:** We started with 70 grams of chlorine and only 35.5 grams were used in the reaction. Therefore, the amount of chlorine leftover is the initial amount minus the amount used.

    Chlorine leftover = 70 - 35.5 = 34.5 grams

A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a diagonal of 9 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the width of the rectangular prism in cm?

**2. Solution:**

Let's denote:
*   Length = l = 8 cm
*   Width = w cm (what we need to find)
*   Height = h = 4 cm
*   Diagonal = d = 9 cm

The formula relating the length, width, height, and diagonal of a rectangular prism is:

d<sup>2</sup> = l<sup>2</sup> + w<sup>2</sup> + h<sup>2</sup>

Plugging in the given values:

9<sup>2</sup> = 8<sup>2</sup> + w<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>

Simplifying:

81 = 64 + w<sup>2</sup> + 16

81 = 80 + w<sup>2</sup>

Subtracting 80 from both sides:

w<sup>2</sup> = 81 - 80

w<sup>2</sup> = 1

Taking the square root of both sides:

w = √1

w = 1

Therefore, the width is 1 cm.

**1. English Translation of the Problem:**

 রাসেল said he had 452 (in hexadecimal) bananas but he gave 9 (in hexadecimal) to Karim. How many bananas does he have left in the hexadecimal number system?

**2. Solution:**

This is a subtraction problem within the hexadecimal (base-16) number system.  We need to subtract 9 (in hexadecimal) from 452 (in hexadecimal).

* **Understanding Hexadecimal:**  In hexadecimal, the digits are 0-9 and A-F, where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, and F=15.

* **Subtraction:**

We need to calculate 452 (hex) - 9 (hex).

   452
-  009
-------

Starting from the rightmost digit:

*   We need to subtract 9 from 2. Since 2 is less than 9, we need to borrow from the next digit to the left (the '5').
*   Borrowing 1 from the '5' in the 16's place gives us 16 (decimal) to add to the 2 in the 1's place.  So now we have 16 + 2 = 18 (decimal) or 12 (hex).  The 5 becomes 4.
*   Now we subtract. 12 (hex) - 9 (hex) = 9 (hex). This gives us 9 in the rightmost place.

Now we move to the next digits:

*   We earlier borrowed from 5 so it turned into 4. We are subtracting 0 from it so 4-0 =4

Now write back the leftmost digit.
Lastly, we write the other zero.

Thus, our overall answer is 449(hex).

So, 452 (hex) - 9 (hex) = 449 (hex)

The problem in Bengali asks: What is the molecular mass of 15 moles of Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)?

**2. Solution:**

To find the molecular mass of 15 moles of sulfur dioxide, we first need to determine the molecular mass of one mole of sulfur dioxide (SO₂). Then, we will multiply that value by 15.

*   **Step 1: Find the atomic masses of Sulfur (S) and Oxygen (O).**
    *   Atomic mass of Sulfur (S) ≈ 32 g/mol
    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol

*   **Step 2: Calculate the molecular mass of SO₂.**
    *   SO₂ has one Sulfur atom and two Oxygen atoms.
    *   Molecular mass of SO₂ = (1 × atomic mass of S) + (2 × atomic mass of O)
    *   Molecular mass of SO₂ = (1 × 32) + (2 × 16)
    *   Molecular mass of SO₂ = 32 + 32
    *   Molecular mass of SO₂ = 64 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the mass of 15 moles of SO₂.**
    *   Mass of 15 moles of SO₂ = 15 × Molecular mass of SO₂

English Translation: 1 gram of hydrogen reacts with 85 grams of chlorine to produce hydrochloric acid. What is the amount of chlorine remaining after the reaction?

**2. Solution:**

We need to determine the limiting reactant to find out how much chlorine will remain after the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine to form hydrochloric acid is:

H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl

First, we need to convert the masses of hydrogen and chlorine into moles.

*   Molar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol
*   Molar mass of Cl₂ = 71 g/mol

Moles of H₂ = (1 g) / (2 g/mol) = 0.5 mol
Moles of Cl₂ = (85 g) / (71 g/mol) ≈ 1.197 mol

According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of H₂ reacts with 1 mole of Cl₂.  Therefore, 0.5 mol of H₂ will react with 0.5 mol of Cl₂.

Now, let's calculate the amount of Cl₂ that reacts:

Moles of Cl₂ that react = 0.5 mol

Mass of Cl₂ that reacts = (0.5 mol) * (71 g/mol) = 35.5 g

Now, we can find the amount of chlorine remaining after the reaction:

Remaining mass of Cl₂ = Initial mass of Cl₂ - Mass of Cl₂ that reacts
Remaining mass of Cl₂ = 85 g - 35.5 g = 49.5 g

Two objects with masses of 15 kg and 10 kg are moving towards each other on the same road from opposite directions. Their speeds are 3 m/s and 5 m/s respectively. They collide head-on and stick together. What is the velocity (in m/s) of the combined mass after the collision?

**2. Solution:**

This problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

*   Let $m_1$ be the mass of the first object (15 kg) and $v_1$ be its velocity (3 m/s).
*   Let $m_2$ be the mass of the second object (10 kg) and $v_2$ be its velocity (-5 m/s).  We take v2 as negative since it is in the opposite direction.
*   Let $V$ be the final velocity of the combined mass $(m_1 + m_2)$ after the collision.

According to the conservation of momentum:

$m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = (m_1 + m_2)V$

Plugging in the given values:

(15 kg)(3 m/s) + (10 kg)(-5 m/s) = (15 kg + 10 kg) * V

45 kg m/s - 50 kg m/s = 25 kg * V

-5 kg m/s = 25 kg * V

V = (-5 kg m/s) / (25 kg)

V = -0.2 m/s

The negative sign indicates that the combined mass is moving in the direction of the second object (the one initially moving at 5 m/s).

A rod's length is measured using a defect-free slide calipers. The main scale reading is 5 mm, and the vernier coincidence is 16. The length of the smallest division on the main scale is 0.5 mm, and 19 divisions of the main scale are equal to 20 divisions of the vernier scale. What is the vernier constant in mm?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Understanding Vernier Constant:** The vernier constant (VC) is the smallest length that can be accurately measured using a vernier calipers. It's calculated as the difference between the value of one main scale division (MSD) and one vernier scale division (VSD).

*   **Given Information:**

    *   Main scale reading = 5 mm
    *   Vernier coincidence = 16
    *   Length of 1 MSD = 0.5 mm
    *   19 MSD = 20 VSD

*   **Finding the value of 1 VSD:**

    Since 19 MSD = 20 VSD, we can write:
    20 VSD = 19 * (0.5 mm)  = 9.5 mm

    Therefore, 1 VSD = 9.5 mm / 20 = 0.475 mm

*   **Calculating the Vernier Constant (VC):**

    VC = 1 MSD - 1 VSD
    VC = 0.5 mm - 0.475 mm

**2. Solution:**

The problem asks for the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. We know the following:

*   The circumference of a circle is given by the formula: Circumference = 2 * pi * radius
*   The diameter of a circle is given by the formula: Diameter = 2 * radius

The radius is given as 5 cm.  However, the problem asks for the *ratio* of the circumference to the diameter. The wonderful thing about this ratio is that it's the same for all circles, regardless of the radius.

The ratio of the circumference to the diameter is:

Circumference / Diameter = (2 * pi * radius) / (2 * radius)

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the '2' and the 'radius':

(2 * pi * radius) / (2 * radius) = pi

Therefore, the ratio is simply pi. We are looking for the value of pi which we all know is approximately 3.14159, but it is also written as the symbol π. We can represent this as the ratio of π to 1.

A hydraulic press has a small and a large piston with areas of 5 sq. cm and 25 sq. cm respectively. If a force of 100 N is applied to the small piston, what force will be obtained on the large piston?

**2. Solution:**

This problem is based on Pascal's principle, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid.  In a hydraulic press, the pressure applied to the smaller piston is transmitted to the larger piston.

*   Let A₁ be the area of the smaller piston and F₁ be the force applied to it.
*   Let A₂ be the area of the larger piston and F₂ be the force obtained on it.

According to Pascal's principle:

Pressure on smaller piston = Pressure on larger piston

Therefore,

F₁ / A₁ = F₂ / A₂

Given:

*   A₁ = 5 sq. cm
*   A₂ = 25 sq. cm
*   F₁ = 100 N

We need to find F₂.

Rearranging the formula:

F₂ = (F₁ / A₁) * A₂

A tetrahedron is thrown twice. How many sample points are there in the probability sample space?

**2. Solution:**

A tetrahedron has 4 faces. When it is thrown once, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

When the tetrahedron is thrown twice, we need to consider all possible pairs of outcomes from the two throws.  We can represent these pairs as (outcome of first throw, outcome of second throw).

The possible pairs are:

We can see that there are 4 rows, each containing 4 pairs. Therefore, the total number of pairs is 4 * 4 = 16.

Alternatively, since the first throw has 4 possibilities and the second throw also has 4 possibilities, the total number of sample points is 4 * 4 = 16. This is because for each outcome of the first throw, we have 4 possible outcomes for the second throw. This represents the Cartesian product of the two sets of outcomes, which yields the sample space.

A wheel has a radius of 0.50 meters. How many meters of distance will it cover in one revolution?

**2. Solution:**

This problem relates to the circumference of a circle, as one revolution of the wheel corresponds to the wheel covering a distance equal to its circumference. The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle, given its radius (r), is:

C = 2 * pi * r

Where pi (π) is approximately equal to 3.14159.

Given the radius r = 0.50 meters, we can substitute this value into the formula:

C = 2 * pi * 0.50
C = pi  meters

Approximating pi as 3.14159, we get:

C ≈ 3.14159 meters

Therefore, the wheel will cover approximately 3.14159 meters in one revolution.

A train running over a railway track causes a temperature difference of 35 degrees Celsius. The coefficient of linear expansion of iron is 34.8 x 10^-6 / Kelvin.  What is the increase in length (in cm) of a 100-meter long railway line due to this heating?

**2. Solution:**

We are given the following:

*   Temperature difference, ΔT = 35 °C (or 35 K, since a change in Celsius is equal to a change in Kelvin)
*   Coefficient of linear expansion of iron, α = 34.8 x 10^-6 / K
*   Original length of the railway line, L = 100 meters

We need to find the increase in length, ΔL, in centimeters.

The formula for linear expansion is:

ΔL = α * L * ΔT

First, let's plug in the values:

ΔL = (34.8 x 10^-6 / K) * (100 m) * (35 K)

ΔL = 34.8 x 10^-6 *100*35 m

ΔL = 0.1218 m

Now, we need to convert the increase in length from meters to centimeters:

1 meter = 100 cm

ΔL = 0.1218 m * (100 cm/m)

ΔL = 12.18 cm

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem translates to:

""At what velocity will the momentum and kinetic energy of an object be equal in magnitude?""

**2. Solution:**

Let's denote:

*  `v` = velocity of the object
*  `m` = mass of the object
*  `p` = momentum of the object
*  `KE` = kinetic energy of the object

We know the formulas for momentum and kinetic energy:

*  p = mv  (Momentum is mass times velocity)
*  KE = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup> (Kinetic Energy is one-half times mass times velocity squared)

The problem states that the magnitude of the momentum is equal to the magnitude of the kinetic energy:

p = KE

So, we can write:

mv = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup>

Now, we can solve for `v`. Since mass `m` of the object is definitely non-zero, we can divide both sides of the equation by `m`:

v = (1/2)v<sup>2</sup>

To solve for `v`, we can rearrange the equation:

(1/2)v<sup>2</sup> - v = 0

Factor out  `v`:

v((1/2)v - 1) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions:

* v = 0
* (1/2)v - 1 = 0

If v = 0, then both the momentum and kinetic energy are zero which is trivially true. We are looking for the non-trivial solution where the object has velocity. Thus:

(1/2)v - 1 = 0
(1/2)v = 1
v = 2

So, the velocity at which the momentum and kinetic energy of the object will be equal (in magnitude) is 2.

A solid metallic sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder of height 32 cm. What is the radius of the resulting cylinder in cm?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Concept:** The key concept here is the conservation of volume. When the sphere is melted and recast into a cylinder, the volume of the metal remains the same. Therefore, Volume of sphere = Volume of cylinder.

*   **Formulae:**
    *   Volume of a sphere = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.
    *   Volume of a cylinder = πr²h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is the height.

*   **Given:**
    *   Radius of the sphere (r_sphere) = 6 cm
    *   Height of the cylinder (h_cylinder) = 32 cm
    *   Let the radius of the cylinder be r_cylinder (which we need to find).

*   **Setting up the equation:**
    Since the volume of the sphere equals the volume of the cylinder, we have:
    (4/3)π(r_sphere)³ = π(r_cylinder)²(h_cylinder)

*   **Substituting the given values:**
    (4/3)π(6)³ = π(r_cylinder)²(32)

*   **Simplifying the equation:**
    We can divide both sides by π:
    (4/3)(6)³ = (r_cylinder)²(32)
    (4/3)(216) = 32(r_cylinder)²
    288 = 32(r_cylinder)²

*   **Solving for (r_cylinder)²:**
    (r_cylinder)² = 288 / 32
    (r_cylinder)² = 9

*   **Solving for r_cylinder:**
    r_cylinder = √9

According to the Pythagorean theorem:

h<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>

Substituting the given values:

h<sup>2</sup> = 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>

English Translation: 10 grams of sodium hydroxide is reacted with 5 grams of carbon dioxide. How many grams of sodium hydroxide will remain after the reaction is complete?

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the limiting reactant and then calculate the amount of sodium hydroxide remaining after the reaction.

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is:

2NaOH + CO2 -> Na2CO3 + H2O

First, calculate the number of moles of each reactant:

*   Molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 (Na) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) = 40 g/mol
    Moles of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol

*   Molar mass of CO2 = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) = 44.01 g/mol
    Moles of CO2 = 5 g / 44.01 g/mol = 0.1136 mol

Now, determine the limiting reactant. From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2. We can calculate the amount of NaOH required to react with 0.1136 moles of CO2:

NaOH required = 2 * 0.1136 mol = 0.2272 mol

Since we have 0.25 moles of NaOH, which is more than the 0.2272 moles required, CO2 is the limiting reactant.  Therefore, all of the carbon dioxide will react and determine the amount of sodium hydroxide used.

Now, calculate the amount of NaOH that reacts with 0.1136 moles of CO2:

Moles of NaOH reacted = 2 * 0.1136 mol = 0.2272 mol

Calculate the mass of NaOH that reacted:

Mass of NaOH reacted = 0.2272 mol * 40 g/mol = 9.088 g

Finally, calculate the amount of NaOH remaining:

*   **Understanding the Concepts:**

    *   Efficiency is a measure of how much of the input energy is converted into useful output energy.
    *   Efficiency (%) = (Output Energy / Input Energy) * 100
    *   In this case, input energy is the electrical energy used by the motor.
    *   Output energy is the potential energy gained by lifting the weight.
    *   Potential Energy (PE) = mgh , however, in this question weight (mg) is provided, so PE becomes Weight * h

*   **Calculate the output energy (Potential Energy):**

    The weight lifted (Force) = 40 N
    The height the weight is lifted (h) = 10 m

    Potential Energy (PE) = Weight * height = 40 N * 10 m = 400 Joules

*   **Identify the input energy:**

    The electrical energy used by the motor (Input Energy) = 700 Joules

*   **Calculate the efficiency:**

    Efficiency = (Output Energy / Input Energy) * 100
    Efficiency = (400 J / 700 J) * 100

**2. Solution:**

Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step:

*   **Net Reading Formula:** The net reading obtained using a Vernier scale is calculated as:

    `Net Reading = Main Scale Reading + (Vernier Coincidence * Vernier Constant)`

*   **Given values:**

    *   Net Reading = 12.66 cm
    *   Main Scale Reading = 12.6 cm
    *   Vernier Coincidence = 6
    *   Vernier Constant = ? (To be found in mm)

*   **Plugging in the values into the formula:**

    `12.66 cm = 12.6 cm + (6 * Vernier Constant)`

*   **Isolating the Vernier Constant:**

    `12.66 cm - 12.6 cm = 6 * Vernier Constant`

    `0.06 cm = 6 * Vernier Constant`

*   **Solving for Vernier Constant:**

    `Vernier Constant = 0.06 cm / 6`

    `Vernier Constant = 0.01 cm`

*   **Converting cm to mm:**

    Since we need the Vernier Constant in millimeters, we convert 0.01 cm to mm.   We know that 1 cm = 10 mm. Therefore:

    `Vernier Constant = 0.01 cm * (10 mm / 1 cm) = 0.1 mm`

The problem ""পারক্লোরিক এসিডের ২২ মোলের আণবিক ভর কত?"" translates to: ""What is the mass of 22 moles of perchloric acid?""

**2. Solution:**

To find the mass of 22 moles of perchloric acid (HClO₄), we need to first determine the molar mass of perchloric acid.  The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the chemical formula.

*   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 g/mol
*   Atomic mass of Chlorine (Cl) ≈ 35.5 g/mol
*   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol

Molar mass of HClO₄ = (1 × Atomic mass of H) + (1 × Atomic mass of Cl) + (4 × Atomic mass of O)
Molar mass of HClO₄ = (1 × 1) + (1 × 35.5) + (4 × 16)
Molar mass of HClO₄ = 1 + 35.5 + 64
Molar mass of HClO₄ = 100.5 g/mol

Now that we know the molar mass of perchloric acid, we can calculate the mass of 22 moles:

Mass of 22 moles of HClO₄ = (Number of moles) × (Molar mass)
Mass of 22 moles of HClO₄ = 22 × 100.5

    *   Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s² (This is a constant value and not explicitly given in the problem, but it's necessary for calculating potential energy.)

*   **Convert mass from grams to kilograms:**
    Since the standard unit of mass is kilograms (kg), and we're aiming to get energy in Joules (which uses SI units), we need to convert the mass:
    m = 50 grams = 50 / 1000 kg = 0.05 kg

A rod is placed in a slide calipers. The reading obtained is as follows: Main scale reading is 4 cm, Vernier coincidence is 7, and Vernier constant is 0.1 mm. What is the length of the rod in cm?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Identify the given values:**
    *   Main Scale Reading (MSR) = 4 cm
    *   Vernier Coincidence (VC) = 7
    *   Vernier Constant (VC) = 0.1 mm

*   **Convert Vernier Constant to cm:**
    Since we want the final answer in cm, we need to convert the Vernier constant from mm to cm.
    1 mm = 0.1 cm
    Therefore, Vernier Constant = 0.1 mm = 0.01 cm

*   **Calculate the Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):**
    Vernier Scale Reading (VSR) = Vernier Coincidence (VC) * Vernier Constant
    VSR = 7 * 0.01 cm = 0.07 cm

*   **Calculate the Total Reading (Length of the rod):**
    Total Reading = Main Scale Reading (MSR) + Vernier Scale Reading (VSR)
    Total Reading = 4 cm + 0.07 cm = 4.07 cm

""How much sodium hydroxide is required to prepare 1 liter of a 1 Molar solution?""

**2. Solution:**

To determine the amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) needed, we need to understand the concept of Molarity (M). Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  In this case:

*   Molarity (M) = 1 M (1 mole/Liter)
*   Volume of solution = 1 Liter

First, we can calculate the number of moles of NaOH needed:

*   Moles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume
*   Moles of NaOH = 1 M × 1 L
*   Moles of NaOH = 1 mole

Now that we know we need 1 mole of NaOH, we need to convert moles to grams using the molar mass of NaOH.

The molar mass of NaOH is calculated by adding the atomic masses of each element:

*   Na (Sodium): ~23 g/mol
*   O (Oxygen): ~16 g/mol
*   H (Hydrogen): ~1 g/mol

Molar mass of NaOH = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the mass of NaOH needed:

*   Mass = Moles × Molar Mass
*   Mass = 1 mole × 40 g/mol
*   Mass = 40 g

So, 40 grams of sodium hydroxide is needed to prepare 1 liter of a 1 Molar solution.

A circle has a diameter of 20 cm. What is the degree measure of the central angle subtended by an arc of length 50 cm?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Find the radius:** The radius of the circle is half of the diameter. So, the radius (r) = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.

*   **Find the circumference:** The circumference (C) of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr.  Using the value of π ≈ 3.14159, the circumference is C = 2 * 3.14159 * 10 cm = 62.8318 cm.

*   **Relate arc length to the central angle:** The ratio of the arc length (s) to the circumference (C) is equal to the ratio of the central angle (θ) in degrees to 360 degrees. This can be written as:  s / C = θ / 360°.

*   **Solve for the central angle:**  We are given the arc length s = 50 cm. We can now solve for θ:

    50 cm / 62.8318 cm = θ / 360°

    θ = (50 cm / 62.8318 cm) * 360°

The radius of the Earth is 6440 km. Dhaka and Chittagong subtend an angle of 5 degrees at the center of the Earth. What is the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong in km?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** We are given the Earth's radius and the angle subtended by the arc connecting Dhaka and Chittagong at the Earth's center. We need to find the length of this arc, which represents the distance between the two cities.

*   **Formula:** The length of an arc (s) is related to the radius (r) of the circle and the angle (θ) subtended by the arc at the center (in radians) by the formula:  *s = rθ*

*   **Converting Degrees to Radians:** The angle is given in degrees, but we need it in radians to use the formula. To convert degrees to radians, we use the following relationship:  radians = (degrees * π) / 180

    Therefore, 5 degrees = (5 * π) / 180 radians = π/36 radians

*   **Applying the Formula:** Now we can use the formula *s = rθ*

Let 's' be the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong.

s = 6440 km * (π/36)

s ≈ 6440 * (3.1416/36) km

A mountain subtends an angle of 2.50 radians at a point 150 kilometers away. How many kilometers high is the mountain?

**2. Solution:**

This problem involves the relationship between the angle subtended by an object, its distance from the observer, and its height (or size).  We can use the small angle approximation, or more accurately, the definition of radian measure to solve this.

The relationship between the arc length *s*, the radius *r*, and the angle in radians *θ* is given by:

*s = rθ*

In this case, the distance to the mountain (150 km) can be considered as the radius *r*, and the height of the mountain corresponds to the arc length *s*. The angle *θ* is given as 2.50 radians. We need to find *s*, which represents the height of the mountain.

So, we have:

*r = 150 km*
*θ = 2.50 radians*
*s = ?*

Using the formula *s = rθ*, we can calculate the height *s*:

*s = 150 km * 2.50*
*s = 375 km*

The problem states: ""A 0.2 molar solution of potassium carbonate is made with 500 mL of water. How many grams of potassium carbonate are there in the solution?""

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the definition of molarity and then use the molar mass of potassium carbonate to convert moles to grams.

*   **Molarity (M):** Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  So, M = moles/Liter.

*   **Given Information:**
    *   Volume of solution: 500 mL = 0.5 L
    *   Molarity of solution: 0.2 M (moles/L)

*   **Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃) in the solution.**

    We can use the molarity formula:

    Moles = Molarity × Volume
    Moles = 0.2 moles/L × 0.5 L
    Moles = 0.1 moles

*   **Step 2: Calculate the molar mass of potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃).**

    The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound.
    *   Potassium (K): 39.10 g/mol (approximately)
    *   Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol (approximately)
    *   Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol (approximately)

    Molar mass of K₂CO₃ = 2(39.10) + 12.01 + 3(16.00)
    Molar mass of K₂CO₃ = 78.20 + 12.01 + 48.00
    Molar mass of K₂CO₃ = 138.21 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Convert moles of K₂CO₃ to grams.**

    We can use the following formula:

    Grams = Moles × Molar mass
    Grams = 0.1 moles × 138.21 g/mol
    Grams = 13.821 g

*   **Hour Hand Position:** The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, or 30 degrees per hour (360/12 = 30). It also moves a fraction of a degree for the minutes. At 8:20, the hour hand is beyond 8. The additional movement in degrees is calculated by (Minutes / 60) * 30.

*   **Minute Hand Position:** The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, or 6 degrees per minute (360/60 = 6).

*   **Calculations:**

    *   **Hour Hand Position:**
        *   At 8 o'clock, the hour hand is at 8 * 30 = 240 degrees from 12.
        *   Additional movement due to 20 minutes: (20/60) * 30 = 10 degrees.
        *   Total position of the hour hand: 240 + 10 = 250 degrees.

A closed container holds 0.25 cubic meters of gas. The gas pressure is 27 x 10^3 Pascals, and the temperature is 40 degrees Celsius. Determine the amount of gas. (Gas constant = 8.314)

2.  **Step-by-step solution in English:**

We are given the volume (V), pressure (P), and temperature (T) of a gas, and we need to find the amount of gas (n, in moles). We can use the ideal gas law to solve this problem:

PV = nRT

Where:

*   P = Pressure (in Pascals)
*   V = Volume (in cubic meters)
*   n = Amount of gas (in moles)
*   R = Gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K))
*   T = Temperature (in Kelvin)

First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:

T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15
T(K) = 40 + 273.15
T(K) = 313.15 K

Now, we can plug the given values into the ideal gas law equation and solve for n:

PV = nRT
(27 x 10^3 Pa) * (0.25 m^3) = n * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (313.15 K)

6750 = n * 2600.25
n = 6750 / 2600.25
n ≈ 2.596

Therefore, the amount of gas is approximately 2.596 moles.

**2. Solution:**

The problem asks us to find the volume of 5 moles of phosphine gas (PH<sub>3</sub>) under standard conditions (STP - Standard Temperature and Pressure). We can utilize the following facts:

*   **STP Conditions:** Standard Temperature and Pressure are defined as 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atmosphere (atm) of pressure.
*   **Molar Volume at STP:** One mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters (or dm<sup>3</sup>) at STP.  This is a well-established experimental observation.
*   **Phosphine as an Ideal Gas:**  For many practical calculations, phosphine can be reasonably assumed to behave as an ideal gas, especially under standard conditions of temperature and pressure.

Therefore, to find the volume of 5 moles of phosphine gas at STP, we multiply the number of moles by the molar volume at STP:

**1. Translation:**

The problem in English is: 5 grams of hydrogen gas are reacted with 30 grams of nitrogen gas. How many moles of nitrogen will remain unreacted?

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen to form ammonia (the Haber process) and then determine the limiting reactant.

The balanced chemical equation is:

N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g)  ⇌ 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g)

This equation tells us that 1 mole of nitrogen gas reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas.

First, we need to convert the given masses into moles:

*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>):**
    *   Molar mass of H<sub>2</sub> = 2 g/mol
    *   Moles of H<sub>2</sub> = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 2 g/mol = 2.5 moles
*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>):**
    *   Molar mass of N<sub>2</sub> = 28 g/mol
    *   Moles of N<sub>2</sub> = mass / molar mass = 30 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 1.07 moles

Now, we determine the limiting reactant. From the balanced equation, 1 mole of N<sub>2</sub> reacts with 3 moles of H<sub>2</sub>.

*   To react with 1.07 moles of N<sub>2</sub>, we would need 1.07 * 3 = 3.21 moles of H<sub>2</sub>. Since we only have 2.5 moles of H<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen is the limiting reactant.
*   Alternatively, to react with 2.5 moles of H<sub>2</sub>, we would need 2.5 / 3 = 0.83 moles of N<sub>2</sub>.

Therefore, hydrogen is the limiting reactant, and nitrogen is in excess.

Next, we calculate how many moles of nitrogen actually react:

*   Since 3 moles of H<sub>2</sub> react with 1 mole of N<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 moles of H<sub>2</sub> will react with 2.5 / 3 = 0.8"

**1. Translation to English:**

A 500 ml solution contains 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid dissolved in it. What is the concentration of the solution?

**2. Step-by-step solution:**

To determine the concentration of the solution, we need to decide on the units for concentration. A common unit for concentration in chemistry is molarity (M), which is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution.

*   **Step 1: Convert volume from ml to liters.**

    We are given the volume of the solution as 500 ml. To convert this to liters, we use the conversion factor 1 L = 1000 ml.

    Volume in liters = 500 ml * (1 L / 1000 ml) = 0.5 L

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).**

    We are given the mass of sulfuric acid as 24.5 grams. To find the number of moles, we need to divide the mass by the molar mass of sulfuric acid.
    The molar mass of H₂SO₄ is calculated as:
    (2 * Atomic mass of H) + (1 * Atomic mass of S) + (4 * Atomic mass of O)
    = (2 * 1.008 g/mol) + (1 * 32.06 g/mol) + (4 * 16.00 g/mol)
    ≈ 2 + 32.06 + 64
    = 98.06 g/mol

    Number of moles of H₂SO₄ = Mass of H₂SO₄ / Molar mass of H₂SO₄
    Number of moles of H₂SO₄ = 24.5 g / 98.06 g/mol ≈ 0.25 mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the molarity of the solution.**

    Molarity (M) = Moles of solute / Liters of solution
    Molarity = 0.25 mol / 0.5 L
    Molarity = 0.5 mol/L  or 0.5 M

The Bengali problem ""গ্লুকোজ এ কার্বনের শতকরা পরিমাণ কত?"" translates to ""What is the percentage of carbon in glucose?"".

**2. Solution:**

To find the percentage of carbon in glucose, we need to know:

*   The chemical formula of glucose: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
*   The atomic masses of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O):
    *   C = 12 amu
    *   H = 1 amu
    *   O = 16 amu

Now, we calculate the molar mass of glucose:

Molar mass(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) = (6 * 12) + (12 * 1) + (6 * 16) = 72 + 12 + 96 = 180 amu

Next, we calculate the total mass of carbon in one mole of glucose:

Mass of carbon = 6 * 12 = 72 amu

Now, we calculate the percentage of carbon in glucose:

Percentage of carbon = (Mass of carbon / Molar mass of glucose) * 100

Percentage of carbon = (72 / 180) * 100

Percentage of carbon = 0.4 * 100 = 40%

v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as

Where:

*   v = final velocity (what we want to find)
*   u = initial velocity (0 m/s, since the object is dropped)
*   a = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)
*   s = displacement (50 m, the height of the building)

Let's plug in the values:

v<sup>2</sup> = (0 m/s)<sup>2</sup> + 2 * (9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>) * (50 m)
v<sup>2</sup> = 0 + 980 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>
v<sup>2</sup> = 980 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>

Now, take the square root of both sides to solve for v:

v = √(980 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>)
v ≈ 31.3 m/s

Therefore, the object will hit the ground with a speed of approximately 31.3 m/s.

**1. Translation:**

A container has 40 grams of sodium metal and 35.5 grams of chlorine gas.  Sodium chloride (table salt) is produced by reacting them in a suitable environment. How many grams of sodium will remain unreacted?

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the limiting reactant and then calculate the amount of sodium consumed.

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium and chlorine is:

2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl

This equation tells us that 2 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of chlorine gas to produce 2 moles of sodium chloride.

*   **Step 1: Convert grams to moles.**

    *   Molar mass of Na = 23 g/mol
        Moles of Na = 40 g / 23 g/mol ≈ 1.739 mol

    *   Molar mass of Cl₂ = 2 * 35.5 g/mol = 71 g/mol
        Moles of Cl₂ = 35.5 g / 71 g/mol = 0.5 mol

*   **Step 2: Determine the limiting reactant.**

    According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of Na react with 1 mole of Cl₂.

    Therefore, 1.739 moles of Na would require 1.739 mol / 2 = 0.8695 mol of Cl₂.

    Since we only have 0.5 moles of Cl₂, chlorine is the limiting reactant. All of the chlorine will be consumed in the reaction.

*   **Step 3: Calculate the amount of sodium consumed.**

    From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Cl₂ reacts with 2 moles of Na.

    Therefore, 0.5 moles of Cl₂ will react with 0.5 mol * 2 = 1 mole of Na.

*   **Step 4: Calculate the amount of sodium remaining.**

    Initial moles of Na = 1.739 mol
    Moles of Na consumed = 1 mol
    Moles of Na remaining = 1.739 mol - 1 mol = 0.739 mol

    Mass of Na remaining = 0.739 mol * 23 g/mol"

**1. English Translation of the Problem:**

An object of mass 10 grams is dropped from a height of 60 meters above the ground. What will be the momentum of the object in kg-m/s after 3 seconds?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Convert mass to kg:**
    Since the momentum needs to be in kg-m/s, we need to convert the mass from grams to kilograms.
    Mass (m) = 10 grams = 10/1000 kg = 0.01 kg

*   **Determine the velocity after 3 seconds:**
    The object is dropped, so the initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s.
    We will use the equation of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity:
    v = u + gt
    where:
        v = final velocity
        u = initial velocity = 0 m/s
        g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)
        t = time = 3 seconds

    v = 0 + (9.8 m/s²) * (3 s)
    v = 29.4 m/s

*   **Calculate the momentum:**
    Momentum (p) is defined as the product of mass and velocity:
    p = mv
    p = (0.01 kg) * (29.4 m/s)
    p = 0.294 kg-m/s

English: The diameter of a circle is 9 cm. What is the radian measure of the central angle subtended by an arc of length 15 cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Find the radius:** The diameter of the circle is 9 cm, so the radius (r) is half of the diameter: r = 9/2 = 4.5 cm.

*   **Recall the arc length formula:** The relationship between arc length (s), radius (r), and the central angle in radians (θ) is given by the formula: s = rθ, where θ is in radians.

*   **Solve for θ:** We are given the arc length s = 15 cm and the radius r = 4.5 cm. We need to find θ.
    Rearrange the formula to solve for θ: θ = s/r

*   **Substitute the values:** Substitute s = 15 cm and r = 4.5 cm into the formula: θ = 15 / 4.5

*   **Calculate θ :** θ = 15 / 4.5 = 10 / 3 radians

The problem states that Lincoln has a toy box with toys representing each number in the binary system. There are 11 more toy boxes for Lincoln's siblings. How many toys do they have in total? (Assuming '11' is in decimal)

**2. Solution:**

This problem is a bit ambiguous, but I will make some reasonable assumptions to provide a plausible solution. The key assumption is about what Lincoln's toy box contains.

*   **Assumption 1: Lincoln's toy box contains toys representing binary numbers 0 and 1.** Since the problem says the toys represent ""each number in the binary system,""  the most basic interpretation is that Lincoln has toys representing the digits 0 and 1, the fundamental building blocks of binary. Therefore, his toy box contains 2 toys.

*   **Assumption 2: The quantity of additional toy boxes is a decimal number.** The problem states ""আরও ১১টি খেলনা বাক্স রয়েছে"" meaning ""there are 11 more toy boxes."" Without further indication, it's reasonable to assume this is a decimal (base-10) number.

*   **Step 1: Determine the total number of toy boxes.** Lincoln has 1 toy box, and his siblings have 11 additional toy boxes. So, there are a total of 1 + 11 = 12 toy boxes.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the total number of toys.** Each toy box contains 2 toys (representing the binary digits 0 and 1). Since there are 12 toy boxes, the total number of toys is 12 * 2 = 24.

What is the percentage composition of carbon in the compound sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃)?

**2. Solution:**

To find the percentage composition of carbon in sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), we need to follow these steps:

*   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of the compound.**

    *   Sodium (Na) has a molar mass of approximately 23 g/mol. Since there are two sodium atoms, the total mass from sodium is 2 * 23 = 46 g/mol.
    *   Carbon (C) has a molar mass of approximately 12 g/mol.
    *   Oxygen (O) has a molar mass of approximately 16 g/mol. Since there are three oxygen atoms, the total mass from oxygen is 3 * 16 = 48 g/mol.

    Therefore, the molar mass of Na₂CO₃ is 46 + 12 + 48 = 106 g/mol.

*   **Step 2: Determine the mass of carbon in one mole of the compound.**

    There is one carbon atom in one molecule of Na₂CO₃.  Therefore, the mass of carbon is its molar mass, which is 12 g/mol.

*   **Step 3: Calculate the percentage composition of carbon.**

    Percentage composition is calculated as:

    (Mass of element / Molar mass of compound) * 100%

    In this case, it is:

    (12 g/mol / 106 g/mol) * 100%  ≈ 11.32%

The problem in English is: ""In a right-angled triangle, the base is 12 and the perpendicular is 5. What is the hypotenuse?""

**2. Solution:**

This problem can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the base and the perpendicular).

Let's denote:
*   Base = b = 12
*   Perpendicular = p = 5
*   Hypotenuse = h

According to the Pythagorean theorem:

h<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> + p<sup>2</sup>

Substituting the given values:

h<sup>2</sup> = 12<sup>2</sup> + 5<sup>2</sup>
h<sup>2</sup> = 144 + 25
h<sup>2</sup> = 169

To find the hypotenuse (h), we take the square root of both sides:

h = 13

Russell said he had 452 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 1000 (in octal) bananas to Karim. How many bananas does he have left in our number system (decimal)?

**2. Solution:**

First, we need to convert the numbers from hexadecimal and octal to decimal.

*   **Converting 452 (hexadecimal) to decimal:**

    The hexadecimal number 452 can be expanded as:

    (4 * 16^2) + (5 * 16^1) + (2 * 16^0) = (4 * 256) + (5 * 16) + (2 * 1) = 1024 + 80 + 2 = 1106

    So, 452 (hexadecimal) is equal to 1106 (decimal).

*   **Converting 1000 (octal) to decimal:**

    The octal number 1000 can be expanded as:

    (1 * 8^3) + (0 * 8^2) + (0 * 8^1) + (0 * 8^0) = (1 * 512) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 1) = 512 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 512

    So, 1000 (octal) is equal to 512 (decimal).

Now, we can find the number of bananas left with Russell by subtracting the number of bananas he gave to Karim from the initial number of bananas he had.

Bananas left = Initial number of bananas - Number of bananas given away

Bananas left = 1106 - 512 = 594

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

We can use the formula for linear thermal expansion to solve this problem:

*  ΔL = α * L₀ * ΔT

Where:

*   ΔL is the change in length.
*   α is the coefficient of linear expansion.
*   L₀ is the original length.
*   ΔT is the change in temperature.

We are given the final length (L), which is related to the original length by:

*   L = L₀ + ΔL
*   L = L₀ + α * L₀ * ΔT
*   L = L₀ (1 + α * ΔT)

We know:

*   L = 10.0167 meters
*   α = 0.000017 per degree Celsius
*   ΔT = 100 degrees Celsius

We need to find L₀. Let's rearrange the equation:

*   L₀ = L / (1 + α * ΔT)

Now, plug in the values:

*   L₀ = 10.0167 / (1 + 0.000017 * 100)

    We know that time = distance / speed.
    Distance = 1000 meters
    Speed = 100 m/s

    Time = 1000 meters / 100 m/s = 10 seconds

A stationary object with a mass of 2 kg is released from above and travels 36 meters in 3 seconds. What is the magnitude of the fluid friction force in Newtons acting on the object?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding the problem:** The problem describes an object falling under gravity and experiencing fluid friction (likely air resistance).  We need to find the magnitude of this friction force.

*   **Identifying relevant formulas and concepts:**
    *   Newton's Second Law of Motion: F = ma (Force = mass x acceleration)
    *   Equation of motion for constant acceleration: s = ut + (1/2)at<sup>2</sup> , where s is distance, u is initial velocity, t is time, and a is acceleration.
    *   Net force is the vector sum of all forces acting on the object. In this case, the net force is the difference between the gravitational force and the friction force.

*   **Step-by-step solution:**

    1.  **Calculate the acceleration:**
        *   Given: s = 36 m, t = 3 s, u = 0 m/s (initial velocity is zero since the object starts from rest).
        *   Using s = ut + (1/2)at<sup>2</sup>, we have:
        *   36 = (0)(3) + (1/2) * a * (3)<sup>2</sup>
        *   36 = (1/2) * a * 9
        *   72 = 9a
        *   a = 72/9 = 8 m/s<sup>2</sup>

    2.  **Calculate the gravitational force:**
        *   F<sub>gravity</sub> = mg, where m is mass and g is acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>).
        *   F<sub>gravity</sub> = (2 kg)(9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>) = 19.6 N

A dice and two coins are thrown simultaneously. How many possible outcomes are there?

2.  **Solution:**

Let's break this down:

*   **Dice:** A standard dice has 6 faces, numbered 1 to 6.  So, when a dice is thrown, there are 6 possible outcomes.

*   **Coin:** A coin has 2 sides - Head (H) and Tail (T). When a coin is thrown, there are 2 possible outcomes.

*   **Two Coins:** When two coins are thrown, the possible outcomes are: (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), and (T, T).  So there are 2 * 2 = 4 possible outcomes.

Since the dice and the two coins are thrown *together*, we need to consider all the combinations of outcomes.  For each of the 6 outcomes of the dice, there are 4 possible outcomes for the two coins. Therefore, the total number of outcomes is the product of the individual possibilities.

Total Outcomes = (Number of outcomes for Dice) * (Number of outcomes for Two Coins) = 6 * 4 = 24

**1. Translation:**

A bag contains 12 blue balls, 16 white balls, and 20 black balls. If a ball is drawn randomly, what is the probability that the ball is not white?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Find the total number of balls.**

    Total number of balls = Number of blue balls + Number of white balls + Number of black balls

    Total number of balls = 12 + 16 + 20 = 48

*   **Step 2: Find the number of balls that are not white.**

    Number of balls that are not white = Number of blue balls + Number of black balls

    Number of balls that are not white = 12 + 20 = 32

*   **Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing a ball that is not white.**

    Probability (not white) = (Number of balls that are not white) / (Total number of balls)

    Probability (not white) = 32 / 48

*   **Step 4: Simplify the probability fraction.**

    32/48 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16.

    32/48 = (32 ÷ 16) / (48 ÷ 16) = 2/3

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem translates to:

""What amount of calcium bicarbonate is present in 2 liters of 0.2 Molar calcium bicarbonate solution?""

**2. Solution:**

Here's how to solve this problem step by step:

*   **Understanding Molarity (M):** Molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution (mol/L).

*   **Given Information:**
    *   Volume of solution = 2 liters
    *   Molarity of calcium bicarbonate solution = 0.2 M

*   **Calculating Moles of Calcium Bicarbonate:**
    We can use the molarity formula to find the number of moles of calcium bicarbonate present in the solution:

    Moles = Molarity × Volume

    Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 2 L = 0.4 moles

*   **Determining the Molar Mass of  Calcium Bicarbonate [Ca(HCO₃)₂]:**
    To find the mass, we need the molar mass of calcium bicarbonate.

    *   Ca: 40.08 g/mol
    *   H: 1.01 g/mol
    *   C: 12.01 g/mol
    *   O: 16.00 g/mol

    Molar mass of Ca(HCO₃)₂ = 40.08 + 2 × (1.01 + 12.01 + 3 × 16.00)
    = 40.08 + 2 × (1.01 + 12.01 + 48.00)
    = 40.08 + 2 x (61.02)
    = 40.08 + 122.04
    = 162.12 g/mol

*   **Calculating the Mass of  Calcium Bicarbonate:** Now we can find the mass of calcium bicarbonate using the following formula:

    Mass = Moles × Molar Mass

    Mass = 0.4 moles × 162.12 g/mol = 64.84"

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem ""৫ মোল গ্লুকোজের আণবিক ভর কত?"" translates to ""What is the mass of 5 moles of glucose?"" in English.

**2. Solution:**

To find the mass of 5 moles of glucose, we need to know the molecular weight (or molar mass) of glucose first. The chemical formula of glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.

*   Atomic weight of Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol
*   Atomic weight of Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol
*   Atomic weight of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol

Therefore, the molecular weight of glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) is calculated as:

(6 * 12.01) + (12 * 1.008) + (6 * 16.00) = 72.06 + 12.096 + 96.00 = 180.156 g/mol

We can approximate this to 180.16 g/mol.

Now, we have the molecular weight of glucose (1 mole). To find the mass of 5 moles of glucose, we multiply the molecular weight by the number of moles:

Mass of 5 moles of glucose = 5 moles * 180.16 g/mol = 900.8 g

The problem asks: ""How many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced from 56 grams of magnesium?""

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

To solve this, we need to understand the chemical reaction that occurs when magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide. The balanced chemical equation is:

2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

This equation tells us that 2 moles of magnesium (Mg) react with 1 mole of oxygen (O₂) to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide (MgO).

*   **Step 1: Find the molar mass of Magnesium (Mg).**
    The molar mass of Mg is approximately 24 g/mol (from the periodic table).

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of Mg in 56 grams.**
    Moles of Mg = (Mass of Mg) / (Molar mass of Mg)
    Moles of Mg = 56 g / 24 g/mol ≈ 2.33 moles

*   **Step 3:  Determine the mole ratio of Mg to MgO.**
    From the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO. Therefore, the mole ratio of Mg to MgO is 1:1.

*   **Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of MgO produced.**
    Since the mole ratio is 1:1, the number of moles of MgO produced is equal to the number of moles of Mg reacted.
    Moles of MgO = 2.33 moles

*   **Step 5: Find the molar mass of Magnesium Oxide (MgO).**
    Molar mass of MgO = (Molar mass of Mg) + (Molar mass of O)
    Molar mass of MgO = 24 g/mol + 16 g/mol = 40 g/mol

*   **Step 6: Calculate the mass of MgO produced.**
    Mass of MgO = (Moles of MgO) * (Molar mass of MgO)
    Mass of MgO = 2.33 moles * 40 g/mol ≈ 93.33 g

**1. Translation to English:**

What is the volume of 88 grams of carbon dioxide gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?

**2. Solution:**

To determine the volume of 88 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), we need to use the ideal gas law and the concept of molar mass. At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.

*   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of CO2.**

    The molar mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12 g/mol.
    The molar mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 g/mol.

    Therefore, the molar mass of CO2 is 12 + (2 * 16) = 12 + 32 = 44 g/mol.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of CO2.**

    We are given 88 grams of CO2.  To find the number of moles, we use the formula:

    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass
    Moles = 88 g / 44 g/mol = 2 moles

*   **Step 3: Calculate the volume at STP.**

    At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.  Since we have 2 moles of CO2, the volume it occupies would be:

    Volume = Moles * Volume per mole (at STP)
    Volume = 2 moles * 22.4 L/mol = 44.8 L

**1. Translation:**

A stone is dropped downwards from a tower with a height of 2000 meters. After how much time will it hit the ground (acceleration due to gravity g = 10)?

**2. Solution:**

This problem involves uniformly accelerated motion. We can use the following kinematic equation to solve for the time it takes for the stone to fall:

`s = ut + (1/2)gt^2`

Where:

*   `s` is the distance the stone falls (2000 meters).
*   `u` is the initial vertical velocity of the stone (0 m/s, since it's dropped).
*   `g` is the acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s²).
*   `t` is the time it takes for the stone to fall (what we want to find).

Plugging in the values, we get:

`2000 = (0)t + (1/2)(10)t^2`

Simplifying the equation:

`2000 = 5t^2`

Now, solve for `t^2`:

`t^2 = 2000 / 5`

`t^2 = 400`

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find `t`:

`t = √400`

`t = 20`

The English translation is: ""A wheel has a diameter of 0.20 meters. How many meters will it travel in one revolution?""

**2. Solution:**

The distance a wheel travels in one revolution is equal to its circumference. The circumference (C) of a circle with diameter (d) is given by the formula:

C = πd

Where π (pi) is approximately equal to 3.14159.

In this problem, the diameter (d) of the wheel is 0.20 meters. Therefore, the circumference of the wheel is:

C = π * 0.20 meters

Using π ≈ 3.14159:

C ≈ 3.14159 * 0.20 meters

C ≈ 0.628318 meters

Therefore, the wheel travels approximately 0.628318 meters in one revolution. Rounding to two decimal places (as the question diameter has two), we get 0.63 meters.

A car accelerates from 36 km/h to 72 km/h in 1 minute. How much distance does the car cover during this time?

**2. Step-by-step Solution with Explanations:**

*   **Convert speeds from km/h to m/s:**

    *   Initial speed (u) = 36 km/h = 36 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 10 m/s
    *   Final speed (v) = 72 km/h = 72 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20 m/s

*   **Convert time from minutes to seconds:**

    *   Time (t) = 1 minute = 60 seconds

*   **Calculate the acceleration (a):**

    *   Acceleration = (Final speed - Initial speed) / Time
    *   a = (v - u) / t = (20 m/s - 10 m/s) / 60 s = 10/60 m/s² = 1/6 m/s²

*   **Calculate the distance (s) using the equation of motion:**

    *   We can use the equation:  s = ut + (1/2)at²
    *   s = (10 m/s * 60 s) + (1/2 * (1/6) m/s² * (60 s)²)
    *   s = 600 m + (1/12 m/s² * 3600 s²)
    *   s = 600 m + 300 m
    *   s = 900 m

The problem states: If 25 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved in 100 ml of solution, what is the concentration of the solution in molarity?

**2. Solution:**

To calculate the molarity of the sulfuric acid solution, we need to follow these steps:

*   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).**

    The molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses of each element in the compound.

    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 g/mol (approximately)  x 2 = 2 g/mol
    *   Sulfur (S): 32 g/mol (approximately)
    *   Oxygen (O): 16 g/mol (approximately) x 4 = 64 g/mol

    Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = 2 + 32 + 64 = 98 g/mol

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).**

    Moles = Mass / Molar mass

    Moles of H₂SO₄ = 25 g / 98 g/mol = 0.2551 moles (approximately)

*   **Step 3: Convert the volume of the solution from milliliters (ml) to liters (L).**

    Volume in liters = Volume in milliliters / 1000

    Volume = 100 ml / 1000 = 0.1 L

*   **Step 4: Calculate the molarity of the solution.**

    Molarity (M) = Moles of solute / Volume of solution in liters

    Molarity = 0.2551 moles / 0.1 L = 2.551 M

A solid metallic sphere of radius 3 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder of height 36 cm. What is the curved surface area of the cylinder in square cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Find the volume of the sphere.**

    The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:  $V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius.

    In this case, $r = 3$ cm.  Therefore, $V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (27) = 36\pi$ cubic cm.

*   **Step 2: Find the volume of the cylinder.**

    The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula: $V_{cylinder} = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.

    We are given that the height of the cylinder $h = 36$ cm. Let the radius of the cylinder be $R$.
    Thus, $V_{cylinder} = \pi R^2 (36) = 36\pi R^2$ cubic cm.

*   **Step 3: Equate the volumes of the sphere and cylinder.**

    Since the sphere is melted and recast into the cylinder, their volumes must be equal.

    Therefore, $V_{sphere} = V_{cylinder} \Rightarrow 36\pi = 36\pi R^2$.

    Dividing both sides by $36\pi$, we get $R^2 = 1$, which means $R = 1$ cm.

*   **Step 4: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder.**

    The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula: $CSA = 2\pi Rh$, where $R$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.

    Here, $R = 1$ cm and $h = 36$ cm.  Therefore, the curved surface area is $CSA = 2\pi (1)(36) = 72\pi$ square cm.

    We are given:

    *   Mass of solute (sulfuric acid, H₂SO₄) = 9.8 grams
    *   Volume of solution = 100 ml

    We need to find:

    *   Molarity of the solution

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).**

    To do this, we need the molar mass of H₂SO₄.

    Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = (2 x atomic mass of H) + (1 x atomic mass of S) + (4 x atomic mass of O)

    Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = (2 x 1) + (1 x 32) + (4 x 16) = 2 + 32 + 64 = 98 g/mol

    Now, we can calculate the number of moles:

    Moles of H₂SO₄ = (Mass of H₂SO₄) / (Molar mass of H₂SO₄)

    Moles of H₂SO₄ = 9.8 g / 98 g/mol = 0.1 mol

*   **Step 3: Convert the volume of the solution from ml to Liters**

    Volume of solution = 100 ml = 100/1000 L = 0.1 L

*   **Step 4: Calculate the Molarity of the solution.**

    Molarity (M) = (Moles of solute) / (Volume of solution in Liters)

    Molarity = 0.1 mol / 0.1 L = 1 mol/L

    Therefore, the molarity of the solution is 1 M.

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem ""১১ মোল কার্বনিক এসিডের আণবিক ভর কত?"" translates to: ""What is the molecular mass of 11 moles of carbonic acid?""

**2. Solution:**

To calculate the molecular mass of 11 moles of carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), we need to first find the molecular mass of a single mole of carbonic acid. Then, we multiply that value by 11.

* **Step 1: Determine the chemical formula for carbonic acid.**
   Carbonic acid is H₂CO₃.

* **Step 2: Find the atomic masses of each element in the formula.**
   * Hydrogen (H): Approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu)
   * Carbon (C): Approximately 12 amu
   * Oxygen (O): Approximately 16 amu

* **Step 3: Calculate the molecular mass of one molecule (or one mole) of H₂CO₃.**
   Molecular mass of H₂CO₃ = (2 * atomic mass of H) + (1 * atomic mass of C) + (3 * atomic mass of O)
   Molecular mass of H₂CO₃ = (2 * 1) + (1 * 12) + (3 * 16)
   Molecular mass of H₂CO₃ = 2 + 12 + 48
   Molecular mass of H₂CO₃ = 62 amu (or 62 grams/mol)

* **Step 4: Calculate the molecular mass of 11 moles of H₂CO₃.**
   Mass of 11 moles H₂CO₃ = 11 * (Molecular mass of 1 mole H₂CO₃)
   Mass of 11 moles H₂CO₃ = 11 * 62
   Mass of 11 moles H₂CO₃ = 682

Therefore, the molecular mass of 11 moles of carbonic acid is 682 grams.

The problem in English is:

""If a number is chosen at random from the natural numbers 1 to 200, what is the probability that the number is a perfect cube?""

**2. Solution:**

Let's define the sample space and the event of interest.

*   **Sample Space (S):** The set of all natural numbers from 1 to 200. The total number of elements in the sample space, |S|, is 200.
*   **Event (E):** The event that the chosen number is a perfect cube.

We need to find the number of perfect cubes between 1 and 200. A perfect cube is a number that can be obtained by cubing an integer (raising an integer to the power of 3).

Let's find the largest integer 'n' such that n<sup>3</sup> ≤ 200.

*   1<sup>3</sup> = 1
*   2<sup>3</sup> = 8
*   3<sup>3</sup> = 27
*   4<sup>3</sup> = 64
*   5<sup>3</sup> = 125
*   6<sup>3</sup> = 216

Since 6<sup>3</sup> = 216 > 200, the perfect cubes between 1 and 200 are 1<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, 3<sup>3</sup>, 4<sup>3</sup>, and 5<sup>3</sup>, or 1, 8, 27, 64, and 125. This means there are 5 perfect cubes within the numbers 1 to 200.

Therefore, the number of elements in event E, |E|, is 5.

The probability of event E is given by:

P(E) = |E| / |S| = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

P(E) = 5 / 200 = 1 / 40

The problem states: In a right-angled triangle, the perpendicular (height) and hypotenuse are 5 and 13 respectively. What is the length of its base?

**2. Solution:**

We are given a right-angled triangle and need to find the length of its base. We know the perpendicular (p) and hypotenuse (h).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states:

*  h² = p² + b²
where:
* h = hypotenuse
* p = perpendicular
* b = base

We are given h = 13 and p = 5.  We need to find b. Substituting the given values into the Pythagorean theorem:

13² = 5² + b²

169 = 25 + b²

Subtract 25 from both sides:

169 - 25 = b²

144 = b²

Take the square root of both sides:

√144 = √b²

12 = b

Therefore, the length of the base is 12.

What is the percentage of carbon in carbon dioxide?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the percentage of carbon in carbon dioxide (CO2), we need to determine the molar mass of carbon, the molar mass of carbon dioxide, and then calculate the ratio of carbon's mass to carbon dioxide's mass, expressing it as a percentage.

*   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of carbon (C).**

    The molar mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.  We can find this value on the periodic table of elements.

*   **Step 2: Determine the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2).**

    Carbon dioxide (CO2) consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.  The molar mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.

    Therefore, the molar mass of CO2 is:

    (1 * molar mass of C) + (2 * molar mass of O) = (1 * 12.01 g/mol) + (2 * 16.00 g/mol) = 12.01 g/mol + 32.00 g/mol = 44.01 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the mass percentage of carbon in carbon dioxide.**

    The mass percentage of carbon in CO2 is calculated as:

    (Molar mass of C / Molar mass of CO2) * 100%

    = (12.01 g/mol / 44.01 g/mol) * 100%  ≈ 27.29%

The problem ""তুঁতে কেলাস পানির শতকরা সংযুক্তি কত?"" translates to: ""What is the percentage composition of water in copper sulfate crystals (CuSO₄.5H₂O)?""

**2. Solution:**

We need to calculate the percentage of water molecules present in one mole of copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄.5H₂O).

*   **Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄.5H₂O).**

    *   Molar mass of Cu = 63.5 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of S = 32 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of H = 1 g/mol

    Therefore:
    Molar mass of CuSO₄.5H₂O = 63.5 + 32 + (4 * 16) + 5 * (2 * 1 + 16)
    = 63.5 + 32 + 64 + 5 * (18)
    = 63.5 + 32 + 64 + 90
    = 249.5 g/mol

*   **Step 2: Calculate the mass of water (5H₂O) in one mole of CuSO₄.5H₂O.**

    *   Molar mass of H₂O = (2 * 1) + 16 = 18 g/mol
    *   Mass of 5H₂O = 5 * 18 = 90 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the percentage of water in CuSO₄.5H₂O.**

    Percentage of water = (Mass of water / Molar mass of CuSO₄.5H₂O) * 100

*   v = final velocity
*   u = initial velocity
*   a = acceleration (in this case, it's deceleration, so 'a' will be negative)
*   t = time

Given:

*   u = 10 m/s
*   a = -2 m/s² (negative because it's deceleration)

The main scale reading is 12 mm, the vernier coincidence is 7, and the vernier constant is 0.10 mm. What is the reading in cm?

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

We are given the following information:

*   Main Scale Reading (MSR) = 12 mm
*   Vernier Scale Coincidence (VSC) = 7
*   Vernier Constant (VC) = 0.10 mm

The total reading is calculated using the formula:

Total Reading = MSR + (VSC × VC)

Substituting the given values:

Total Reading = 12 mm + (7 × 0.10 mm)
Total Reading = 12 mm + 0.7 mm
Total Reading = 12.7 mm

Now, we need to convert the reading from millimeters (mm) to centimeters (cm). We know that 1 cm = 10 mm. Therefore, to convert mm to cm, we divide by 10.

Total Reading = 12.7 mm / 10

Lincoln has a toy box where each toy represents a number in the binary number system. There are 5 more toy boxes for Lincoln's siblings. How many toys do they have in total?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** The key is understanding that Lincoln's toy box contains toys representing each number in the binary system. Since the problem doesn't specify a range of binary numbers, we'll assume it includes at least '0' and '1'. We're also told there are 5 *more* boxes for his siblings, suggesting Lincoln also has one. Thus, there are 6 boxes in total. The difficult aspect is the seemingly vague implication that there are single binary number toys, but really what it means is each toy *represents* a number.

*   **Toys Per Box:** Since the problem says ""each number in the binary number system,"" we need to consider what *numbers* are represented. While theoretically, the binary number system is infinite, the problem seems to be implying a starting point. We should use the number system to represent the numbers used to refer to the number of binary places, i.e. 0 and 1, for the sake of simplicity and reasoning skill. It isn't explicit that we need to refer to the numbers 0 and 1, but this allows the solver to demonstrate that there are numerical reasoning skills being demonstrated. Each box contains at *least* 2 toys, representing '0' and '1'.

*   **Total Number of Boxes:** Lincoln has one box, and his siblings have 5 more, summing to 1 + 5 = 6 boxes.

*   **Total Number of Toys:** If we have 6 boxes, and each has 2 toys, 2 toys * 6 boxes leads to 12 toys.

A metallic solid sphere with a diameter of 5 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. What is the height of the resulting cylinder in cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Find the radius of the sphere.**

    The diameter of the sphere is 5 cm. Therefore, its radius (r_sphere) is 5/2 = 2.5 cm.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the volume of the sphere.**

    The volume of a sphere is given by the formula: V_sphere = (4/3) * π * (r_sphere)^3.

    Substituting the value of r_sphere:  V_sphere = (4/3) * π * (2.5)^3  = (4/3) * π * 15.625

*   **Step 3: State the radius of the cylinder**
    The radius of the cylinder (r_cylinder) is 3 cm.

*   **Step 4: Express the volume of the cylinder**
    Let the height of the cylinder be 'h' cm.
    The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula: V_cylinder = π * (r_cylinder)^2 * h. Where h is the height of the cylinder.

    Substituting the value of r_cylinder: V_cylinder = π * (3)^2 * h = 9πh

*   **Step 5: Equate the volumes and solve for h.**

    Since the sphere is melted and recast into the cylinder, their volumes must be equal.

    V_sphere = V_cylinder

    (4/3) * π * 15.625 = 9πh

    Divide both sides by π: (4/3) * 15.625 = 9h

    Multiply both sides by 3: 4 * 15.625 = 27h

    62.5 = 27h

    h = 62.5 / 27 ≈ 2.3148

*   **Step 6: Round to four decimal places (optional, but good practice).**

""How many atoms are there in 1 molecule of ferric carbonate?""

**2. Step-by-step solution:**

To solve this, we need to know the chemical formula of ferric carbonate. Ferric refers to iron with a +3 oxidation state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), and carbonate is a polyatomic ion with the formula CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>.  To balance the charges and create a neutral compound, we need two ferric ions and three carbonate ions.  Therefore, the chemical formula for ferric carbonate is Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.

Now we can determine the number of atoms in one molecule of Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> :

*   Iron (Fe): There are 2 iron atoms.
*   Carbon (C): There are 3 carbonate ions, and each has 1 carbon atom, so there are 3 * 1 = 3 carbon atoms.
*   Oxygen (O): There are 3 carbonate ions, and each has 3 oxygen atoms, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 oxygen atoms.

A solid metallic sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder with a height of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the cylinder in square cm?

**2. Step-by-step solution:**

*   **Step 1: Find the radius of the sphere.**

    The diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, so the radius (r) of the sphere is 6/2 = 3 cm.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the volume of the sphere.**

    The volume (V_sphere) of a sphere is given by the formula: V_sphere = (4/3)πr³.
    Substituting r = 3 cm, we get: V_sphere = (4/3)π(3³) = (4/3)π(27) = 36π cubic cm.

*   **Step 3: Find the radius of the cylinder.**

    The volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder since the metal is simply recast.
    The volume (V_cylinder) of a cylinder is given by the formula: V_cylinder = πR²h, where R is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.
    We are given that h = 4 cm. So, V_cylinder = πR²(4) = 4πR².
    Since V_sphere = V_cylinder, we have 36π = 4πR².
    Dividing both sides by 4π yields: R² = 9.
    Taking the square root of both sides, we get R = 3 cm.

*   **Step 4: Calculate the total surface area of the cylinder.**

    The total surface area (TSA) of a cylinder is given by the formula: TSA = 2πR(R + h).
    Substituting R = 3 cm and h = 4 cm, we get: TSA = 2π(3)(3 + 4) = 2π(3)(7) = 42π square cm.

A person with a mass of 70 kg climbs a 100-meter-high hill in 5 minutes. What is his power in watts? Gravitational acceleration is 9.8 m/s².

**2. Solution:**

To find the power, we'll use the following steps:

*   **Step 1: Calculate the potential energy gained by the person.**

    The potential energy (PE) gained is given by the formula:

    PE = mgh

    where:
    *   m = mass of the person (70 kg)
    *   g = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)
    *   h = height of the hill (100 m)

    PE = 70 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 100 m = 68600 J (Joules)

*   **Step 2: Calculate the time taken in seconds.**

    The time taken is 5 minutes, which needs to be converted to seconds.

    Time = 5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds

*   **Step 3: Calculate the power.**

    Power (P) is the rate at which work is done (or energy is transferred), and it is given by:

    P = Work / Time = Energy / Time

    In this case, the work done is equal to the potential energy gained.

""What is the probability of rolling a 3 on a single throw of a fair six-sided die?""

**2. Solution:**

A standard six-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

*   **Total Possible Outcomes:**  When a die is rolled once, any one of the six faces can appear. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 6.

*   **Favorable Outcomes:** We are interested in the event of rolling a 3. There is only one face with the number 3. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1.

*   **Probability Calculation:**  Probability is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

    Probability (rolling a 3) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

    Probability (rolling a 3) = 1 / 6

**1. Translation of the Bengali problem into English:**

The problem asks: What is the volume of nitrogen dioxide produced by heating 0.25 moles of magnesium nitrate?

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations:**

First, we need to write the balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of magnesium nitrate upon heating. Magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO3)2, decomposes to form magnesium oxide (MgO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and oxygen (O2).  The balanced equation is:

2Mg(NO3)2(s) → 2MgO(s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g)

From the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of Mg(NO3)2 produce 4 moles of NO2. This means the mole ratio of Mg(NO3)2 to NO2 is 2:4 or 1:2.

Given that we have 0.25 moles of Mg(NO3)2, the number of moles of NO2 produced can be calculated using the mole ratio:

Moles of NO2 = (Moles of Mg(NO3)2) * (Mole ratio of NO2 to Mg(NO3)2)
Moles of NO2 = 0.25 moles * (4 moles NO2 / 2 moles Mg(NO3)2)
Moles of NO2 = 0.25 moles * 2
Moles of NO2 = 0.5 moles

Now, to find the volume of NO2 produced, we'll assume the reaction occurs at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), which is 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm.  At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.

Volume of NO2 = (Moles of NO2) * (Volume of 1 mole of gas at STP)
Volume of NO2 = 0.5 moles * 22.4 L/mole
Volume of NO2 = 11.2 L

The Bengali problem translates to: ""In the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, how many grams of oxygen are required to produce 9 grams of water?""

**2. Solution:**

This problem relates to stoichiometry, specifically using the balanced chemical equation for the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen to determine the mass of oxygen required.

*   **Write the balanced chemical equation:**

    2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

*   **Determine the molar masses:**

    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16 g/mol = 32 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of H₂O = (2 * 1 g/mol) + 16 g/mol = 18 g/mol

*   **Interpret the balanced equation in terms of molar masses:**

    The balanced equation tells us that 1 mole of O₂ (32 g) reacts to produce 2 moles of H₂O (2 * 18 = 36 g).

*   **Set up a proportion:**

    We want to find out how many grams of O₂ are needed to produce 9 grams of H₂O.  We can set up a proportion:

    (grams of O₂) / (grams of H₂O) = (32 g O₂) / (36 g H₂O)

    Let *x* be the grams of O₂ needed. Then:

    *x* / 9 = 32 / 36

*   **Solve for x:**

    Multiply both sides of the equation by 9:

    *x* = (32 / 36) * 9

    *x* = (32 * 9) / 36

    *x* = 288 / 36

    *x* = 8

Therefore, 8 grams of oxygen are required to produce 9 grams of water.

A bullet of mass 20 grams is fired from a gun of mass 5 kg with a velocity of 500 m/s. The firing lasts for 0.1 seconds. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by the gun on the bullet?

**2. Solution:**

We can solve this problem using the concept of impulse and the relationship between impulse and force. Impulse is the change in momentum of an object.  It is also equal to the force applied to the object multiplied by the time interval over which the force is applied.

*   **Given:**
    *   Mass of the bullet (m) = 20 grams = 0.02 kg (converting to kg)
    *   Final velocity of the bullet (v) = 500 m/s
    *   Initial velocity of the bullet (u) = 0 m/s (bullet starts from rest inside the gun)
    *   Time interval (t) = 0.1 s

*   **Calculate the change in momentum (impulse) of the bullet:**
    *   Change in momentum = final momentum - initial momentum
    *   Change in momentum = mv - mu
    *   Change in momentum = (0.02 kg)(500 m/s) - (0.02 kg)(0 m/s)
    *   Change in momentum = 10 kg m/s

*   **Calculate the force exerted by the gun on the bullet:**
    *   Impulse = Force × Time
    *   Force = Impulse / Time
    *   Force = 10 kg m/s / 0.1 s
    *   Force = 100 N

Therefore, the magnitude of the force exerted by the gun on the bullet is 100 N.

**2. Solution:**

We are given two probabilities:

*   P(Khulna to Rajshahi by bus) = 4/5
*   P(Rajshahi to Rangpur by train) = 6/7

We want to find the probability that he *does not* go from Rajshahi to Rangpur by train.  This is the complement of the given probability.

*   P(Rajshahi to Rangpur NOT by train) = 1 - P(Rajshahi to Rangpur by train) = 1 - (6/7) = 1/7

Now, we want the probability of both events occurring: going from Khulna to Rajshahi by bus *and* not going from Rajshahi to Rangpur by train.  Assuming these two events are independent (i.e., whether or not he takes the train from Rajshahi to Rangpur doesn't depend on whether he took the bus from Khulna to Rajshahi), we can multiply the probabilities:

P(Khulna to Rajshahi by bus AND Rajshahi to Rangpur NOT by train) = P(Khulna to Rajshahi by bus) * P(Rajshahi to Rangpur NOT by train) = (4/5) * (1/7) = 4/35

A body of unit mass is thrown upwards with a velocity of 10 m/s. At what height from the ground will the kinetic energy and potential energy of the object be equal?

**2. Solution:**

Let's denote:

*   *m* = mass of the object = 1 kg
*   *v* = initial velocity = 10 m/s
*   *g* = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s² (approximately)
*   *h* = height at which kinetic energy (KE) equals potential energy (PE).

At height *h*, KE = PE.

Let's write the expressions for KE and PE at height *h*.

Potential Energy (PE) at height *h*:
PE = *mgh*

Kinetic Energy (KE) at height *h*:
To find the KE at height *h*, we first need to determine the velocity (*v'*) of the object at that height. We can use the following kinematic equation:

*v'² = v² - 2gh*

So, KE = (1/2) * m * v'² = (1/2) * m * (v² - 2gh)

Since KE = PE at height *h*:

(1/2) * m * (v² - 2gh) = mgh

Divide both sides by *m*:

(1/2) * (v² - 2gh) = gh

Multiply both sides by 2:

v² - 2gh = 2gh

v² = 4gh

Now, solve for *h*:

h = v² / (4g)

Substitute the given values:

h = (10 m/s)² / (4 * 9.8 m/s²)

h = 100 / 39.2

h ≈ 2.55 meters

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to know the molecular formula of glucose and its molar mass.

*   **Step 1: Identify the molecular formula of glucose.**

    The molecular formula of glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the molar mass of glucose.**

    To calculate the molar mass, we need the atomic masses of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Approximations are sufficient:

    *   Atomic mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 g/mol
    *   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 g/mol
    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol

    Therefore, the molar mass of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is:

    (6 × 12) + (12 × 1) + (6 × 16) = 72 + 12 + 96 = 180 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the mass of 10 moles of glucose.**

**1. Translation to English:**

Two wheels have a difference of 90 cm in their circumferences. What is the difference in their radii in cm?

**2. Solution:**

Let the radii of the two wheels be \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), where \(r_1 > r_2\).
The circumferences of the two wheels are \(2\pi r_1\) and \(2\pi r_2\), respectively.
We are given that the difference in their circumferences is 90 cm. Therefore:

\(2\pi r_1 - 2\pi r_2 = 90\)

We can factor out \(2\pi\) from the left side of the equation:

\(2\pi(r_1 - r_2) = 90\)

Now, we want to find the difference in their radii, which is \(r_1 - r_2\). To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by \(2\pi\):

\(r_1 - r_2 = \frac{90}{2\pi}\)

\(r_1 - r_2 = \frac{45}{\pi}\)

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx \frac{22}{7}\), we have:

\(r_1 - r_2 = \frac{45}{\frac{22}{7}}\)

\(r_1 - r_2 = \frac{45 \times 7}{22}\)

\(r_1 - r_2 = \frac{315}{22}\)

\(r_1 - r_2 \approx 14.318\)

Rounding to two decimal places, \(r_1 - r_2 \approx 14.32\) cm.

For a more accurate result use \(\pi \approx 3.1416\),

Then, \(r_1 - r_2 = \frac{45}{\pi} \approx \frac{45}{3.1416} \approx 14.3239\)

Rounding to two decimal places, \(r_1 - r_2 \approx 14.32\) cm.

How many grams of nitric acid are present in 250 cubic centimeters of 0.01 Molar nitric acid solution?

**2. Solution:**

Here's a step-by-step solution to calculate the mass of nitric acid:

*   **Understanding Molarity:** Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  So, a 0.01 M solution of nitric acid (HNO3) contains 0.01 moles of HNO3 in 1 liter (1000 cm³) of solution.

*   **Convert Volume:** We are given the volume in cubic centimeters (cm³), which can also be stated as milliliters (mL). We need to convert this to liters:
    250 cm³ = 250 mL = 250/1000 L = 0.25 L

*   **Calculate Moles:** Using the molarity and volume, we can calculate the number of moles of HNO3:
    Moles of HNO3 = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
    Moles of HNO3 = 0.01 mol/L × 0.25 L = 0.0025 moles

*   **Calculate Molar Mass of HNO3:** The molar mass of a compound is the sum of the atomic masses of its constituent atoms.  The atomic masses are:
    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 g/mol
    *   Nitrogen (N): 14 g/mol
    *   Oxygen (O): 16 g/mol
    Molar mass of HNO3 = 1 + 14 + (3 × 16) = 1 + 14 + 48 = 63 g/mol

*   **Calculate Mass of HNO3:**  Now we can find the mass of HNO3 using the number of moles and the molar mass:
    Mass of HNO3 = Moles × Molar Mass
    Mass of HNO3 = 0.0025 moles × 63 g/mol = 0.1575 g

*   **Understanding the problem:** We need to calculate the total mass of 10 moles of nitrogen molecules (N<sub>2</sub>). This requires knowing the molar mass of nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>).

*   **Find the atomic mass of Nitrogen (N):** The atomic mass of Nitrogen (N) is approximately 14 grams per mole (g/mol). We can usually look this up on the periodic table.

*   **Calculate the molar mass of Nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>):** Since nitrogen gas exists as a diatomic molecule (N<sub>2</sub>), its molar mass is twice the atomic mass of nitrogen.  Therefore, the molar mass of N<sub>2</sub> = 2 * 14 g/mol = 28 g/mol.

*   **Calculate the mass of 10 moles of N<sub>2</sub>:** To find the mass of 10 moles of N<sub>2</sub>, we multiply the molar mass of N<sub>2</sub> by the number of moles.  Mass = (Number of moles) * (Molar Mass) = 10 moles * 28 g/mol = 280 grams.

A boy runs 8 complete laps on a circular path with a radius of 5 meters. What is the displacement of the boy in meters?

2.  **Solution:**

Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final points of an object's motion. Since the boy completes 8 *complete* laps around the circular path, he ends up at exactly the same point where he started. Therefore, the shortest (and only) distance between his starting and ending point is zero.

**1. Translation:**

A boy walks 3/4 of the circumference of a circular field with a radius of 20 meters. What is the displacement of the boy in meters?

**2. Solution:**

The problem asks for the *displacement*, not the distance traveled. Displacement is the shortest distance between the starting point and the ending point, a straight line. The boy travels 3/4 of the circumference. This means he *doesn't* complete a full circle.

*   **Circumference:** The circumference of the circular field is given by the formula 2πr, where r is the radius.  So, the circumference is 2 * π * 20 = 40π meters.

*   **Arc Length Traveled:** The boy travels 3/4 of the circumference, so the arc length he travels is (3/4) * 40π = 30π meters. This is the *distance* he traveled along the circular path.

*   **Finding the Displacement:**  The boy starts at some point on the circle (let's say he starts at the point (20,0) on a coordinate plane centered at (0,0)). After traveling 3/4 of the circumference, he ends up 3/4 of the way around the circle.  This puts him 270 degrees from his starting point.  If he starts at (20,0), his ending point is (0,-20). The displacement is the length of the straight line connecting the starting and ending points. In this case, it's the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with two sides equal to the radius. If the boy starts, for instance, from the rightmost point of the circle, and moves along the perimeter clockwise, after covering ¾ of the circumference, he will end up at the bottom-most point on the perimeter. The displacement will be the straight line connecting these two points. The value of which can be calculated using Pythagoras theorem.

* Let the two points be A and B.
* Let the center of the circle be O.
* Then OA = OB = radius = 20m
* The angle AOB = 90 degrees (since the boy traverse through 3/4 of the circle from the right side, thus skipping the first quadrant).

At what temperature does the reading on the Fahrenheit scale become twice the reading on the Celsius scale?

**2. Solution:**

Let F be the temperature in Fahrenheit and C be the temperature in Celsius.
We are given that F = 2C.
We also know the relationship between Fahrenheit and Celsius is:

F = (9/5)C + 32

Now we can substitute F = 2C into the equation:

2C = (9/5)C + 32

To solve for C, we first subtract (9/5)C from both sides of the equation:

2C - (9/5)C = 32

Now we need to find a common denominator to combine the C terms. The common denominator is 5.

(10/5)C - (9/5)C = 32

(1/5)C = 32

Now, multiply both sides by 5 to isolate C:

C = 32 * 5

C = 160

Now that we have the Celsius temperature, we can find the Fahrenheit temperature using F = 2C:

F = 2 * 160

F = 320

Let's verify the Celsius and Fahrenheit relationship using the equation F = (9/5)C + 32:
F = (9/5) * 160 + 32
F = 9 * 32 + 32
F = 288 + 32
F = 320

Thus, the Fahrenheit reading is twice the Celsius reading at 160 degrees Celsius and 320 degrees Fahrenheit.  We are asked to find the temperature, and both Celsius and Fahrenheit readings are related in the problem description to each other. Let's use the Fahrenheit reading.

A lottery has sold 760 tickets. Raju bought 20 tickets.  The tickets are thoroughly mixed, and one ticket is randomly drawn. What is the probability that Raju does not win the first prize?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Total number of tickets:** 760
*   **Number of tickets Raju bought:** 20
*   **Number of tickets Raju *didn't* buy:** 760 - 20 = 740

The probability of Raju *not* winning the first prize is the ratio of the number of losing tickets for Raju (the tickets he didn't buy) to the total number of tickets.

Probability (Raju doesn't win) = (Number of tickets Raju didn't buy) / (Total number of tickets)

Probability (Raju doesn't win) = 740 / 760

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20:

740 / 20 = 37
760 / 20 = 38

Therefore, the probability that Raju does not win the first prize is 37/38.

At standard temperature and pressure (STP), how many liters of ammonia can be obtained from 4 liters of nitrogen, assuming all reactants and products are gases?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

First, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia (the Haber process):

N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g)  ⇌ 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g)

This equation tells us that 1 mole of nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) to produce 2 moles of ammonia gas (NH<sub>3</sub>).

Since the reaction takes place at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), we can use Avogadro's Law, which states that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules (or moles).  Therefore, the mole ratio in the balanced equation can be directly translated into a volume ratio.  This greatly simplifies the calculation.

From the balanced equation, we can see that:

1 volume of N<sub>2</sub> produces 2 volumes of NH<sub>3</sub>.

Now, we are given that we have 4 liters of N<sub>2</sub>. We can set up a proportion to find the volume of NH<sub>3</sub> produced:

(1 volume N<sub>2</sub>) / (2 volumes NH<sub>3</sub>) = (4 liters N<sub>2</sub>) / (x liters NH<sub>3</sub>)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

1 * x = 2 * 4

x = 8 liters

Therefore, 4 liters of nitrogen will produce 8 liters of ammonia if there is sufficient hydrogen.

How many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced from 20 grams of magnesium?

2. **Solution:**

To solve this, we need to use stoichiometry based on the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O₂) to form magnesium oxide (MgO).

The balanced chemical equation is:

2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

From the balanced equation, we see that 2 moles of Mg react to produce 2 moles of MgO. This simplifies to a 1:1 mole ratio between Mg and MgO.

**Step 1: Find the number of moles of Mg.**

The atomic mass of Mg is approximately 24 g/mol.

Moles of Mg = (Mass of Mg) / (Atomic mass of Mg)
Moles of Mg = 20 g / 24 g/mol
Moles of Mg ≈ 0.833 mol

**Step 2: Find the number of moles of MgO produced.**

Since the mole ratio of Mg to MgO is 1:1, the number of moles of MgO produced is equal to the number of moles of Mg reacted.

Moles of MgO = 0.833 mol

**Step 3: Find the mass of MgO produced.**

The molar mass of MgO is approximately 24 g/mol (Mg) + 16 g/mol (O) = 40 g/mol.

Mass of MgO = (Moles of MgO) * (Molar mass of MgO)
Mass of MgO = 0.833 mol * 40 g/mol
Mass of MgO ≈ 33.32 g

A metallic solid sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder with a radius of 1 cm. What is the height of the resulting cylinder in cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Volume Conservation:** When a solid is melted and recast into a different shape, its volume remains constant. Therefore, the volume of the sphere will be equal to the volume of the cylinder.

*   **Formula for the Volume of a Sphere:** The volume \(V_s\) of a sphere with radius \(r\) is given by:  \(V_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\)

*   **Formula for the Volume of a Cylinder:** The volume \(V_c\) of a cylinder with radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is given by: \(V_c = \pi r^2 h\)

*   **Applying the Formulas:**

    *   Radius of the sphere, \(r_s = 3\) cm.  So, the volume of the sphere is:
        \(V_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36\pi\) cubic cm.

    *   Radius of the cylinder, \(r_c = 1\) cm. Let the height of the cylinder be \(h\) cm.  So, the volume of the cylinder is:
        \(V_c = \pi (1)^2 h = \pi h\) cubic cm.

*   **Equating the Volumes:** Since the volume of the sphere equals the volume of the cylinder:
    \(36\pi = \pi h\)

*   **Solving for h:**  Divide both sides by \(\pi\):
    \(h = 36\)

Therefore, the height of the cylinder is 36 cm.

An object with a mass of 3 kg is moving eastward at a velocity of 2 m/s. Another object with a mass of 1 kg is moving westward at a velocity of 2 m/s. At some point, the two objects collide and merge into one. What is the velocity (in m/s) of the combined object?

**2. Solution:**

This problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. Momentum is a vector quantity, so direction is important. We'll consider eastward as positive and westward as negative.

*   **Momentum of the first object (before collision):**
    *   Mass (m1) = 3 kg
    *   Velocity (v1) = 2 m/s (eastward, positive)
    *   Momentum (p1) = m1 * v1 = 3 kg * 2 m/s = 6 kg m/s

*   **Momentum of the second object (before collision):**
    *   Mass (m2) = 1 kg
    *   Velocity (v2) = -2 m/s (westward, negative)
    *   Momentum (p2) = m2 * v2 = 1 kg * (-2 m/s) = -2 kg m/s

*   **Total momentum before collision:**
    *   P_before = p1 + p2 = 6 kg m/s + (-2 kg m/s) = 4 kg m/s

*   **Total mass after collision:**
    *   M = m1 + m2 = 3 kg + 1 kg = 4 kg

*   **Let V be the velocity of the combined object after the collision.**
    *   Total momentum after collision: P_after = M * V = 4 kg * V

*   **Conservation of momentum:**
    *   P_before = P_after
    *   4 kg m/s = 4 kg * V

*   **Solving for V:**
    *   V = (4 kg m/s) / (4 kg) = 1 m/s

A car driver traveling at a speed of 54 km/h sees a pedestrian 46 meters ahead and immediately applies the brakes. The car stops 1 meter in front of the pedestrian. What was the car's acceleration?

**2. Solution:**

This is a problem involving uniformly decelerated motion (since the car is slowing down due to braking). We can use the following kinematic equation:

v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as

where:

*   v = final velocity (m/s)
*   u = initial velocity (m/s)
*   a = acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>)
*   s = distance traveled during deceleration (m)

First, we need to convert the initial velocity from km/h to m/s:

u = 54 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 15 m/s

The car stops 1 meter before hitting the pedestrian, who was initially 46 meters away. Therefore, the distance 's' the car travels while decelerating is:

s = 46 m - 1m = 45 m

The final velocity, v, is 0 m/s because the car comes to a stop.

Now we can plug these values into the kinematic equation:

0<sup>2</sup> = 15<sup>2</sup> + 2 * a * 45

0 = 225 + 90a

-225 = 90a

a = -225 / 90

a = -2.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>

The acceleration is negative because it represents deceleration (slowing down).

**2. Solution:**

To find the molar mass of 12 moles of methane (CH₄), we need to first determine the molar mass of a single mole of methane and then multiply it by 12.

*   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of methane (CH₄).**

    *   The molar mass of an element is approximately equal to its atomic mass in atomic mass units (amu). We can find these values on the periodic table.
    *   Carbon (C) has a molar mass of approximately 12 g/mol.
    *   Hydrogen (H) has a molar mass of approximately 1 g/mol.
    *   Methane (CH₄) contains 1 carbon atom and 4 hydrogen atoms.
    *   Therefore, the molar mass of CH₄ = (1 × molar mass of C) + (4 × molar mass of H) = (1 × 12 g/mol) + (4 × 1 g/mol) = 12 g/mol + 4 g/mol = 16 g/mol.

A metallic solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square cm?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Find the volume of the sphere.**

    The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius.
    Given radius r = 6 cm,
    Volume of sphere, V = (4/3) * π * (6)³
    V = (4/3) * π * 216
    V = 288π cubic cm

*   **Step 2: Relate the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder.**

    Since the sphere is melted and recast into the cylinder, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder.

    Volume of cylinder = Volume of sphere
    Volume of cylinder = 288π cubic cm

*   **Step 3: Find the radius of the cylinder.**

    The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
    Given height h = 32 cm and Volume V = 288π cubic cm.

    πr²(32) = 288π
    r² = 288π / (32π)
    r² = 9
    r = √9
    r = 3 cm

*   **Step 4: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder.**

    The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula CSA = 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height.
    Given, radius r = 3 cm, height h = 32 cm
    CSA = 2 * π * 3 * 32

An object, starting from rest, attains a velocity of 20 m/s after 5 seconds. What distance (in meters) will the object travel in the subsequent 10 seconds?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution and Explanation:**

First, we need to find the acceleration of the object during the first 5 seconds. Since the object starts from rest, its initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s.  The final velocity (v) after 5 seconds is 20 m/s. We can use the following equation of motion:

*v = u + at*

Where:
*   v = final velocity
*   u = initial velocity
*   a = acceleration
*   t = time

Plugging in the values:

20 = 0 + a * 5
a = 20 / 5
a = 4 m/s²

Now, during the next 10 seconds the acceleration remains same because the problem does mention that acceleration is constant. Therefore after the initial 5 seconds, and during the subsequent 10 seconds (total time = 15 s) the acceleration is still a = 4 m/s².

At the beginning of the 10-second interval, the velocity i.e. initial velocity (u') = 20 m/s. The acceleration remains constant at (a') = 4 m/s².  The time interval (t') = 10 seconds.  We can use another equation of motion to calculate the distance (s') covered during this time:

*s' = u't' + (1/2)a'(t')²*

Where:
*   s' = distance
*   u' = initial velocity (at the beginning of this 10 second interval)
*   a' = acceleration
*   t' = time

Plugging in the values:

s' = (20 * 10) + (1/2 * 4 * 10²)
s' = 200 + (2 * 100)
s' = 200 + 200
s' = 400 meters

""What is the mass of 9 moles of Sulfur Dioxide?""

**2. Solution:**

To find the mass of 9 moles of Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), we need to know the molar mass of SO₂ first. The molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses of each element in the compound, multiplied by the number of atoms of that element.

*   Molar mass of Sulfur (S) = 32.06 g/mol ≈ 32 g/mol
*   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol  ≈ 16 g/mol

Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) has one sulfur atom and two oxygen atoms.

Molar mass of SO₂ = (1 × Molar mass of S) + (2 × Molar mass of O)
Molar mass of SO₂ = (1 × 32 g/mol) + (2 × 16 g/mol)
Molar mass of SO₂ = 32 g/mol + 32 g/mol
Molar mass of SO₂ = 64 g/mol

Now that we know the molar mass of SO₂ is 64 g/mol, we can find the mass of 9 moles of SO₂:

Mass of 9 moles of SO₂ = (Number of moles) × (Molar mass)

A circular arc of a circle with a radius of 5 cm subtends an angle of 60 degrees at the center. What is the approximate length of the arc in cm?

**2. Solution:**

We need to find the length of an arc of a circle. The formula for the length of an arc (s) is given by:

s = rθ

where:
* r is the radius of the circle
* θ is the angle subtended at the center in radians.

First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians.  We know that 180 degrees = π radians. Therefore,

60 degrees = (60/180) * π radians = (1/3) * π radians

Now we can plug the values into the formula:

s = rθ = 5 * (π/3)  cm

Since we need an approximate answer, we can use the approximation π ≈ 3.1416.

s ≈ 5 * (3.1416/3) cm

s ≈ 5 * 1.0472 cm

s ≈ 5.236 cm

Rounding to a more reasonable approximation, we get:

s ≈ 5.24 cm

**1. Translation:**
The given problem in Bengali translates to:

""If 24 grams of magnesium is burned in sufficient air, how many grams of magnesium oxide will be obtained?""

**2. Solution:**

This problem involves stoichiometry. We need to use the balanced chemical equation for the reaction to relate the mass of magnesium to the mass of magnesium oxide.

The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of magnesium in air (reaction with oxygen) is:

2Mg(s) + O₂(g) → 2MgO(s)

This equation indicates that 2 moles of magnesium (Mg) react with 1 mole of oxygen (O₂) to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide (MgO).

First, we need to find the number of moles of magnesium we have:

*   Atomic mass of Mg = 24 g/mol
*   Given mass of Mg = 24 g
*   Number of moles of Mg = (Given mass) / (Atomic mass) = 24 g / 24 g/mol = 1 mol

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO. This means 1 mole of Mg will produce 1 mole of MgO.

Therefore, 1 mole of Mg will produce 1 mole of MgO.

Now, we need to find the mass of 1 mole of MgO:

*   Atomic mass of Mg = 24 g/mol
*   Atomic mass of O = 16 g/mol
*   Molar mass of MgO = 24 g/mol + 16 g/mol = 40 g/mol

Since 1 mole of MgO is produced, the mass of MgO produced is equal to its molar mass.

Mass of MgO produced = 1 mol * 40 g/mol = 40 g

A boy with a mass of 40 kg climbs a staircase to the roof in 15 seconds. The staircase has 20 steps, and each step has a height of 16 cm. What is the power of the boy in watts?

**2. Step-by-step solution:**

*   **Find the total height climbed:**

    *   Number of steps = 20
    *   Height of each step = 16 cm = 0.16 m
    *   Total height (h) = Number of steps * Height of each step = 20 * 0.16 m = 3.2 m

*   **Calculate the potential energy gained by the boy:**

    *   Mass of the boy (m) = 40 kg
    *   Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s² (approximate value)
    *   Potential energy (PE) = m * g * h = 40 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 3.2 m = 1254.4 J (Joules)

*   **Calculate the power of the boy:**

    *   Time taken (t) = 15 seconds
    *   Power (P) = Work done / Time taken.  Since the work done is equal to the potential energy gained by the boy, we have:

        P = PE / t = 1254.4 J / 15 s = 83.62666... W

*   **Round up to two decimal points:**

    *   Power (P) ≈ 83.63 W

This translates to English as: ""What is the volume of 17 grams of ammonia gas at standard conditions?""

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to use the molar mass of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and the molar volume of a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

* **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).**

The atomic mass of Nitrogen (N) is approximately 14 g/mol, and the atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 g/mol.  Therefore, the molar mass of NH<sub>3</sub> is:

14 (N) + 3 * 1 (H) = 14 + 3 = 17 g/mol

* **Step 2:  Calculate the number of moles of ammonia.**

We are given that we have 17 grams of ammonia. To find the number of moles, we divide the mass by the molar mass:

Moles of NH<sub>3</sub> = (Mass of NH<sub>3</sub>) / (Molar mass of NH<sub>3</sub>)
Moles of NH<sub>3</sub> = 17 g / 17 g/mol = 1 mol

* **Step 3: Use the molar volume at STP.**

At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters. This is the molar volume at STP.

* **Step 4:  Calculate the volume of 1 mole of ammonia at STP.**

Since we have 1 mole of ammonia, the volume at STP is simply:

Volume = (Number of moles) * (Molar volume at STP)
Volume = 1 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 22.4 L

**1. Translation:**

A 1 kg object is thrown vertically upwards. It falls to the ground after 10 seconds. What will be the potential energy of the object at its maximum height in Joules?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Finding the time to reach maximum height:** Since the total time of flight is 10 seconds, the time taken to reach the maximum height is half of the total time (due to symmetry of projectile motion, neglecting air resistance).

    Time to reach maximum height, t = 10 seconds / 2 = 5 seconds.

*   **Finding the initial velocity:** We know that at the maximum height, the final velocity (v) is 0. We can use the following equation of motion to find the initial velocity (u):

    v = u + at
    where,
    v = final velocity (0 m/s)
    u = initial velocity (what we want to find)
    a = acceleration (here, it's the acceleration due to gravity, -g = -9.8 m/s²)
    t = time (5 seconds)

    Plugging in the values:
    0 = u - 9.8 * 5
    u = 9.8 * 5
    u = 49 m/s

*   **Finding the maximum height:** We can use another equation of motion to find the maximum height (h):

    v² = u² + 2as
    where,
    v = final velocity (0 m/s)
    u = initial velocity (49 m/s)
    a = acceleration (-g = -9.8 m/s²)
    s = displacement or height (h, what we want to find)

    Plugging in the values:
    0² = 49² + 2 * (-9.8) * h
    0 = 2401 - 19.6 * h
    19.6 * h = 2401
    h = 2401 / 19.6
    h = 122.5 meters

**1. Translation:**

A coin is tossed 2000 times, and heads appears 1030 times. What is the probability of getting tails when the coin is tossed once?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding Probability:** Probability is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, we are looking for the probability of getting tails in a single toss.

*   **Calculating the Number of Tails:** The total number of tosses is 2000. Heads appeared 1030 times. Therefore, the number of tails is:

    Number of tails = Total tosses - Number of heads
    Number of tails = 2000 - 1030 = 970

*   **Calculating the Probability of Tails:**

    Probability of tails = (Number of tails) / (Total number of tosses)
    Probability of tails = 970 / 2000

*   **Simplifying the Fraction:** We can simplify the fraction 970/2000 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 10, then expressing as a decimal.

Russell said he had 67 (in hexadecimal) bananas. He then took 10000 (in binary) bananas from Karim. According to our number system (decimal), how many bananas does Russell have?

**2. Solution:**

We need to convert both the hexadecimal and binary numbers to decimal numbers, and then add them together.

*   **Convert 67 (hexadecimal) to decimal:**

    The hexadecimal number 67 can be expressed as:

    (6 * 16<sup>1</sup>) + (7 * 16<sup>0</sup>) = (6 * 16) + (7 * 1) = 96 + 7 = 103

    So, 67 (hexadecimal) is equal to 103 (decimal).

*   **Convert 10000 (binary) to decimal:**

    The binary number 10000 can be expressed as:

    (1 * 2<sup>4</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>0</sup>) = (1 * 16) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 16

    So, 10000 (binary) is equal to 16 (decimal).

A metallic solid sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted and recast into a right circular cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Find the radius of the sphere.**

    The diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, so its radius (r_sphere) is 6/2 = 3 cm.

*   **Step 2: Find the volume of the sphere.**

    The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V_sphere = (4/3)πr_sphere³.
    Therefore, V_sphere = (4/3)π(3)³ = (4/3)π(27) = 36π cubic cm.

*   **Step 3: Find the volume of the cylinder.**

    Let the height of the cylinder be h.  The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula V_cylinder = πr_cylinder²h.
    The radius of the cylinder (r_cylinder) is given as 3 cm.
    Therefore, V_cylinder = π(3)²h = 9πh cubic cm.

*   **Step 4: Equate the volumes.**

    Since the sphere is melted and recast into the cylinder, their volumes must be equal.
    So, 36π = 9πh

*   **Step 5: Solve for the height of the cylinder (h).**

    Divide both sides of the equation by 9π:
    h = 36π / 9π = 4 cm

*   **Step 6: Find the curved surface area of the cylinder.**

    The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula CSA = 2πr_cylinder*h.
    Therefore, CSA = 2π(3)(4) = 24π square cm.

**1. English Translation:**

How many grams of oxygen are required to produce 56 grams of Calcium Oxide?

**2. Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the chemical reaction involved and the molar masses of the substances.  Calcium Oxide (CaO) is formed by the reaction of Calcium (Ca) with Oxygen (O₂).  The balanced chemical equation is:

2Ca + O₂ → 2CaO

This equation tells us that 1 mole of oxygen gas (O₂) reacts to produce 2 moles of Calcium Oxide (CaO).

Now let's find the molar masses:

*   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16 g/mol = 32 g/mol
*   Molar mass of CaO = 40 g/mol (Ca) + 16 g/mol (O) = 56 g/mol

From the balanced equation, 32g of O₂ produces 2 * 56g = 112g of CaO.

We can set up a proportion to find the amount of oxygen needed to produce 56g of CaO:

(Grams of O₂ / Grams of CaO) = (32g / 112g)

Let x be the amount of oxygen needed to produce 56g of CaO.  Then,

x / 56g = 32g / 112g

x = (32g / 112g) * 56g

x = (32 / 112) * 56

x = 32 * (56/112)

x = 32 * (1/2)

x = 16g

A motorcycle's velocity decreases uniformly from 30 m/s to 14 m/s in 8 seconds. What is the deceleration (retardation) of the motorcycle in m/s²?

**2. Solution:**

We are given the initial velocity, final velocity, and time taken for the change in velocity.  We need to find the deceleration.  Deceleration is the rate of decrease of velocity, and it's simply the magnitude of the negative acceleration.

*   **Initial velocity (u):** 30 m/s
*   **Final velocity (v):** 14 m/s
*   **Time (t):** 8 s

We can use the following equation of motion:

v = u + at

where:

*   v = final velocity
*   u = initial velocity
*   a = acceleration
*   t = time

We need to find 'a' (acceleration).  Rearranging the formula, we get:

a = (v - u) / t

Now, substitute the given values:

a = (14 m/s - 30 m/s) / 8 s

a = (-16 m/s) / 8 s

a = -2 m/s²

Since we are looking for deceleration, it's the magnitude of the negative acceleration.

Deceleration = |-2| m/s² = 2 m/s²

A spherical ball with a diameter of 6 cm fits exactly inside a cube-shaped box. What is the volume of the box in cubic centimeters?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** The key here is that the sphere *exactly* fits inside the cube.  This means the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of a side of the cube.

*   **Finding the side length of the cube:**  The diameter of the sphere is given as 6 cm. Since the sphere fits perfectly inside the cube, the side length of the cube is equal to the sphere's diameter. Therefore, the side length (s) of the cube is 6 cm.

*   **Calculating the volume of the cube:** The volume (V) of a cube is given by the formula V = s³, where 's' is the side length. In this case, s = 6 cm.

Russell said he had 77 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 10000 (in binary) bananas to Karim. According to our number system (decimal), how many bananas does he have left?

**2. Solution:**

First, we need to convert the numbers from their original bases (hexadecimal and binary) to our familiar decimal (base-10) system.

*   **Convert 77 (hexadecimal) to decimal:**

    In hexadecimal (base-16), the rightmost digit is the 16<sup>0</sup> place and the next digit to the left is the 16<sup>1</sup> place. Therefore:

    77<sub>16</sub> = (7 * 16<sup>1</sup>) + (7 * 16<sup>0</sup>)
    = (7 * 16) + (7 * 1)
    = 112 + 7
    = 119

    So, Russell initially had 119 bananas.

*   **Convert 10000 (binary) to decimal:**

    In binary (base-2), the rightmost digit is the 2<sup>0</sup> place, the next digit is the 2<sup>1</sup> place, and so on.  Therefore:

    10000<sub>2</sub> = (1 * 2<sup>4</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>0</sup>)
    = (1 * 16) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1)
    = 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
    = 16

    So, Russell gave away 16 bananas.

*   **Calculate remaining bananas:**

    To find the number of bananas Russell has left, subtract the number of bananas given away from the initial number of bananas:

    Remaining bananas = Initial bananas - Bananas given away
    = 119 - 16
    = 103

Therefore, Russell has 103 bananas left."

What is the volume of 10 grams of Helium gas at standard conditions?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the volume of Helium gas under standard conditions (STP), we'll use the ideal gas law and the molar mass of Helium. Standard conditions are defined as 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm pressure.

*   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of Helium.**

    The molar mass of Helium (He) is approximately 4 g/mol.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of Helium.**

    Given mass of Helium = 10 grams
    Moles of Helium (n) = (Given mass) / (Molar mass) = 10 g / 4 g/mol = 2.5 mol

*   **Step 3: Apply the ideal gas law at STP.**

    The ideal gas law is: PV = nRT, where:

    *   P = Pressure (1 atm at STP)
    *   V = Volume (what we want to find)
    *   n = Number of moles (2.5 mol)
    *   R = Ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm / (mol K))
    *   T = Temperature (273.15 K at STP)

    Rearrange the formula to solve for V:

    V = nRT / P

*   **Step 4: Substitute the values and calculate the volume.**

    V = (2.5 mol * 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * 273.15 K) / 1 atm
    V = (2.5 * 0.0821 * 273.15) L

C + O₂ → CO₂

This means 1 mole of carbon reacts with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 1 mole of carbon dioxide.

*   **Step 1: Find the molar masses.**

    *   Molar mass of Carbon (C) ≈ 12 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O₂) ≈ 32 g/mol

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of each reactant.**

    *   Moles of Carbon (C) = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 12 g/mol ≈ 0.4167 mol
    *   Moles of Oxygen (O₂) = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 32 g/mol ≈ 0.15625 mol

*   **Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant.**

    The balanced equation tells us that 1 mole of carbon reacts with 1 mole of oxygen.  Compare the mole ratio:

    *   Ratio of C to O₂ available: 0.4167 mol / 0.15625 mol ≈ 2.67

    Since we have significantly more carbon relative to oxygen than required by the balanced equation (ratio > 1), oxygen is the limiting reactant. This means all of the oxygen will be used up in the reaction, and some carbon will be left over.

*   **Step 4: Calculate the amount of carbon that reacts.**

    Since the mole ratio of C to O₂ is 1:1, the number of moles of carbon that react is equal to the number of moles of oxygen available, which is 0.15625 mol.

*   **Step 5: Calculate the mass of carbon that reacts.**

    Mass of Carbon (C) reacted = moles × molar mass = 0.15625 mol × 12 g/mol = 1.875 g

What is the molecular mass of 19 moles of Fluorine?

**2. Step-by-step solution:**

*   **Identify the chemical formula of Fluorine:** Fluorine exists as a diatomic molecule, meaning its chemical formula is F₂.

*   **Find the atomic mass of Fluorine (F):** The atomic mass of Fluorine is approximately 19 atomic mass units (amu) or 19 grams per mole (g/mol). We can find this information on the periodic table.

*   **Calculate the molecular mass of F₂:** Since Fluorine exists as F₂, the molecular mass is 2 * atomic mass of F = 2 * 19 g/mol = 38 g/mol. This means one mole of F₂ has a mass of 38 grams.

*   **Calculate the mass of 19 moles of F₂:** To find the mass of 19 moles, we multiply the molecular mass of F₂ by 19. Mass = moles * molecular mass = 19 moles * 38 g/mol

*   **Perform the calculation:** 19 * 38 = 722

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem ""৫৪ কিলোমিটার/ ঘণ্টা সমান কত মিটার/ সেকেন্ড?"" translates to:

""54 kilometers/hour is equal to how many meters/second?""

**2. Solution:**

We need to convert 54 kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s).  Here's how we do it:

*   **Kilometers to meters:** 1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters (m)
*   **Hours to seconds:** 1 hour (h) = 60 minutes (min) and 1 minute (min) = 60 seconds (s). Therefore, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.

Now, let's apply these conversions to 54 km/h:

54 km/h = 54 * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) / (3600 seconds / 1 hour)

= 54 * (1000 m) / (3600 s)

= 54000 m / 3600 s

= 540 / 36 m/s

= 15 m/s

A basket contains 15 white, 10 black, and 20 red balls. A ball is drawn at random. What is the probability that the ball is either white or red?

**2. Step-by-step solution and explanation:**

*   **Step 1: Identify the total number of balls.**
    *   Total balls = White balls + Black balls + Red balls
    *   Total balls = 15 + 10 + 20 = 45

*   **Step 2: Identify the number of favorable outcomes (white or red balls).**
    *   Favorable outcomes = Number of white balls + Number of red balls
    *   Favorable outcomes = 15 + 20 = 35

*   **Step 3: Calculate the probability.**
    *   Probability (White or Red) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of balls)
    *   Probability (White or Red) = 35 / 45

English: To produce 4 grams of magnesium oxide, 2 grams of magnesium and 2 grams of oxygen gas were mixed in a suitable environment. However, the desired amount of product was not obtained. How many grams of oxygen reacted in the reaction?

**2. Solution:**

The problem states that 2 grams of magnesium (Mg) and 2 grams of oxygen (O₂) were used in an attempt to create magnesium oxide (MgO). It also states that a *total* of 4 grams of magnesium oxide was supposed to be produced, but they didn't get the *desired* amount. The critical aspect here is determining how much oxygen *actually reacted*.

1. **Balanced Chemical Equation:** First, write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

   2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

2. **Molar Masses:** Determine the molar masses of the relevant substances:

   *   Mg: 24 g/mol
   *   O₂: 32 g/mol
   *   MgO: 40 g/mol

3. **Theoretical Yield based on Magnesium** If all 2g of Mg reacted completely, the grams of MgO produce can be calcuated.
   * Grams of Mg = 2g
   * Moles of Mg = 2g / (24g/mol) = 0.0833 mol
   * Moles of MgO that would be produced given the balanced equation = 0.0833 mol
   * Grams of MgO produced = 0.0833 mol * (40 g/mol) = 3.33 g

4. **Actual Yield based on given information** We know that not all the magnesium reacted, since only 4 g was to be produced. However, since that product amount also was not achieved, we know that the final amount must be less than 3.33 g.

5. **Empirically observed amount** The problem states the final, obvserved amount of MgO is not the desired "

A bullet of mass 5 grams is fired from a gun of mass 1 kg.  The gun recoils with a velocity of 2 m/s. What is the final velocity of the bullet in m/s?

**2. Solution:**

This problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of momentum.  The total momentum of the system (gun + bullet) is conserved before and after firing.  Initially, both the gun and the bullet are at rest, so the initial momentum is zero.  After firing, the momentum of the bullet plus the momentum of the gun must also be zero.

Let:

*   `m_g` = mass of the gun = 1 kg
*   `v_g` = recoil velocity of the gun = -2 m/s (negative because it's in the opposite direction to the bullet)
*   `m_b` = mass of the bullet = 5 grams = 0.005 kg (converted to kg)
*   `v_b` = final velocity of the bullet (what we want to find)

According to the conservation of momentum:

Initial momentum = Final momentum

0 = `m_g * v_g + m_b * v_b`

Now, we can plug in the values and solve for `v_b`:

0 = (1 kg * -2 m/s) + (0.005 kg * `v_b`)

2 = 0.005 * `v_b`

`v_b` = 2 / 0.005

`v_b` = 400 m/s

A car's velocity decreases uniformly from 30 m/s to 10 m/s in 5 seconds. What is the acceleration of the car in m/s²?

**2. Solution:**

We are given the initial velocity, final velocity, and the time taken for this change in velocity. We need to find the acceleration.

*   **Initial velocity (u):** 30 m/s
*   **Final velocity (v):** 10 m/s
*   **Time (t):** 5 s

We can use the following formula to calculate acceleration (a):

a = (v - u) / t

Substituting the given values into the formula:

a = (10 m/s - 30 m/s) / 5 s
a = (-20 m/s) / 5 s
a = -4 m/s²

The negative sign indicates that the car is decelerating (i.e., the acceleration is in the opposite direction to the initial velocity).

A 150-gram piece of iron at 75 degrees Celsius is immersed in 150 grams of water at 30 degrees Celsius. The final temperature is 56 degrees Celsius. The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/kg/Kelvin, and the specific heat capacity and density of iron are 450 J/kg/Kelvin and 7800 kg/cubic meter, respectively. What is the heat absorbed by the water in Joules?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

We need to calculate the heat absorbed by the water to reach the final temperature. We can use the following formula for heat transfer:

*   Q = m * c * ΔT

Where:

*   Q = Heat transferred (in Joules)
*   m = mass (in kg)
*   c = specific heat capacity (in J/kg/Kelvin)
*   ΔT = change in temperature (in Celsius or Kelvin, since the change is the same)

Let's apply this to the water:

*   m (water) = 150 g = 0.150 kg
*   c (water) = 4200 J/kg/Kelvin
*   ΔT (water) = Final temperature - Initial temperature = 56°C - 30°C = 26°C

Now, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the water:

*   Q (water) = m (water) * c (water) * ΔT (water)
*   Q (water) = 0.150 kg * 4200 J/kg/Kelvin * 26°C

**2. Solution:**

This problem relates to the concept of a mole in chemistry, which is deeply tied to Avogadro's number.  Here's how to solve it:

*   **Understanding Avogadro's Number:** Avogadro's number (approximately 6.022 x 10^23) represents the number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities in one mole of a substance.

*   **Relating Atoms to Moles:** The problem states we have 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen atoms. Since 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mole is essentially one mole, we can say we have approximately 1 mole of oxygen atoms.

*   **Finding the Molar Mass of Oxygen:** The molar mass of an element is the mass of one mole of that element. We can find the molar mass of oxygen (O) on the periodic table, which is approximately 16 grams/mole. Note: the molar mass of Oxygen gas (O2) is approximately 32 g/mol. However, the question explicitly asks about *oxygen atoms*.

*   **Calculating the Mass:** Since we have 1 mole of oxygen atoms and the molar mass of oxygen is 16 grams/mole, the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen atoms is:

    Mass = (Number of moles) x (Molar mass)
    Mass = (1 mole) x (16 grams/mole)

**2. Solution:**

To find the mass of 0.1 moles of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), we need to know the molar mass of sulfuric acid.

*   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).**

    *   The molar mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 g/mol.
    *   The molar mass of sulfur (S) is approximately 32 g/mol.
    *   The molar mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 g/mol.

    Therefore, the molar mass of H₂SO₄ is:
    (2 × 1 g/mol) + (1 × 32 g/mol) + (4 × 16 g/mol) = 2 + 32 + 64 = 98 g/mol

*   **Step 2: Calculate the mass of 0.1 moles of sulfuric acid.**

    We know that 1 mole of H₂SO₄ has a mass of 98 grams.  Therefore, 0.1 moles of H₂SO₄ will have a mass of:

A spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is floating with half of its body submerged in water. What is the buoyancy force acting on the sphere?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding Buoyancy:** The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged portion of the object (Archimedes' principle).

*   **Given Information:**
    *   Total volume of the sphere (V) = 200 m³
    *   Volume submerged (V_submerged) = V / 2 = 200 m³ / 2 = 100 m³
    *   Density of water (ρ_water) ≈ 1000 kg/m³  (This is a standard value we should know or assume.)
    *   Acceleration due to gravity (g) ≈ 9.8 m/s² (Again, a standard value.)

*   **Steps:**

    1.  **Calculate the mass of the water displaced:**
        The mass of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the submerged portion multiplied by the density of water.
        Mass of water displaced (m_water) = V_submerged * ρ_water = 100 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ = 100,000 kg

    2.  **Calculate the weight of the water displaced:**
        The weight of the water displaced is equal to the mass of the water displaced multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. This weight is the buoyancy force.

""How many grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) should be dissolved in 200 ml of solution to make its concentration semi-molar?""

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

*   **Understanding Semi-molar:** A semi-molar solution means a solution with a concentration of 0.5 M (0.5 moles per liter).

*   **Given Information:**
    *   Volume of solution = 200 ml = 0.2 L (since 1 L = 1000 ml)
    *   Molarity of solution = 0.5 M

*   **Formula Application:**
    *   Molarity (M) = Number of moles of solute / Volume of solution in liters
    *   Therefore, Number of moles of solute = Molarity × Volume of solution in liters

*   **Calculating Moles of NaOH:**
    *   Number of moles of NaOH = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles

*   **Calculating Grams of NaOH:**
    *   We know that, Number of moles = Given mass / Molar mass
    *   Molar mass of NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide) = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol

A hydraulic press is based on the principle of force multiplication. The diameter of the larger piston is 8 times the diameter of the smaller piston. How many times more force will be felt on the larger piston?

**2. Step-by-step Solution with Explanation:**

*   **Understanding the Principle:** The hydraulic press works on Pascal's principle, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.  Therefore, the pressure on the smaller piston is equal to the pressure on the larger piston.

*   **Relationship between Force, Pressure, and Area:** Pressure (P) is defined as Force (F) divided by Area (A):  P = F/A

*   **Areas of the Pistons:** Since the pistons are circular, their areas are given by A = πr², where r is the radius. We are given the relationship between the *diameters* of the pistons. Diameter (d) = 2r, so r = d/2. Therefore, the area can also be expressed as A = π(d/2)² = (π/4)d².

*   **Area Ratio:** Let d₁ be the diameter of the smaller piston and d₂ be the diameter of the larger piston. We are given d₂ = 8d₁. Therefore, the areas are:

    *   A₁ = (π/4)d₁²  (Area of the smaller piston)
    *   A₂ = (π/4)d₂² = (π/4)(8d₁)² = (π/4)(64d₁²) = 64 * (π/4)d₁² = 64A₁ (Area of the larger piston)

    This means the area of the larger piston is 64 times the area of the smaller piston.

*   **Force Ratio:** Since P₁ = P₂, and P = F/A, we have F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂. We want to find the ratio F₂/F₁ (how many times greater the force on the larger piston is compared to the smaller piston).

    Rearranging the equation, we get: F₂/F₁ = A₂/A₁

    We know A₂ = 64A₁, so F₂/F₁ = 64A"

**2. Solution:**

This is a classic set theory problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion.  We are given the number of students who like cricket, the number who like football, and the number who like both. To find the total number of students who like *at least* one game, we need to avoid double-counting the students who like both.

Let:
* C be the set of students who like cricket.  |C| = 60
* F be the set of students who like football. |F| = 40
* C ∩ F be the set of students who like both cricket and football. |C ∩ F| = 25

We want to find |C ∪ F|, which represents the number of students who like either cricket or football or both.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets:

|C ∪ F| = |C| + |F| - |C ∩ F|

Substituting the given values:

|C ∪ F| = 60 + 40 - 25

|C ∪ F| = 100 - 25

|C ∪ F| = 75

**1. Translation:** Two angles add up to 60 degrees, and their difference is 30 degrees. What is the measure of the smaller angle in degrees?

**2. Solution:**

Let the two angles be  'x' and 'y', where x is the larger angle and y is the smaller angle.

We are given two pieces of information:

*   x + y = 60  (The sum of the two angles is 60 degrees)
*   x - y = 30  (The difference of the two angles is 30 degrees)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.  A convenient method is to use elimination.

Adding the two equations together, we get:

(x + y) + (x - y) = 60 + 30

2x = 90

x = 90 / 2

x = 45

Now that we know the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the first equation,  x + y = 60:

45 + y = 60

y = 60 - 45

y = 15

So, the two angles are 45 degrees and 15 degrees.  The smaller angle is 15 degrees.

A solid metallic sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder of height 4 cm. What is the radius of the resulting cylinder in cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** The problem involves conservation of volume. The volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder since the metal is simply recast. We need to find the radius of the cylinder.

*   **Formulas:**
    *   Volume of a Sphere:  V_sphere = (4/3)πr_sphere³
    *   Volume of a Cylinder: V_cylinder = πr_cylinder²h

*   **Given Information:**
    *   Diameter of the sphere (d_sphere) = 6 cm
    *   Radius of the sphere (r_sphere) = d_sphere / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm
    *   Height of the cylinder (h) = 4 cm

*   **Setting up the equation:**
    Since the volume of the sphere equals the volume of the cylinder, we have:
    (4/3)πr_sphere³ = πr_cylinder²h

*   **Solving for r_cylinder:**
    1.  Substitute the known values:
        (4/3)π(3 cm)³ = πr_cylinder²(4 cm)
    2.  Simplify:
        (4/3)π(27 cm³) = πr_cylinder²(4 cm)
    3.  Divide both sides by π:
        (4/3)(27 cm³) = r_cylinder²(4 cm)
    4.  Multiply:
        36 cm³ = r_cylinder²(4 cm)
    5.  Divide both sides by 4 cm:
        9 cm² = r_cylinder²
    6.  Take the square root of both sides:
        r_cylinder = √(9 cm²) = 3 cm

The 19 divisions on the main scale of a slide calipers are equal to 20 divisions on the vernier scale. When the length of a small rod is placed between its two jaws, it is observed that the zero mark of the vernier scale crosses the 5.2 cm mark of the main scale. Also, the 14th division of the vernier scale coincides with a division on the main scale. What is the length of the rod in cm?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution with Explanation:**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the length of the rod using the readings from the slide calipers. We'll need to determine the least count of the calipers first.

*   **Calculate the Least Count (LC):**

    *   The least count is the smallest measurement that the instrument can measure accurately. It is calculated as the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division.

    *   We are given that 19 main scale divisions (MSD) = 20 vernier scale divisions (VSD).

    *   Therefore, 1 VSD = (19/20) MSD

    *   Since the main scale is in cm, let's assume 1 MSD = 0.1 cm (as slide calipers generally have divisions of 1mm or 0.1cm on main scale. If its not 1mm, the answer will change but the calculation is the same)

    *   So, 1 VSD = (19/20) * 0.1 cm = 0.095 cm

    *   Least Count (LC) = 1 MSD - 1 VSD = 0.1 cm - 0.095 cm = 0.005 cm

*   **Calculate the Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):**

    *   The vernier scale reading is the number of the vernier scale division that coincides with a main scale division, multiplied by the least count.

    *   We are given that the 14th division of the vernier scale coincides with a division on the main scale.

    *   Therefore, VSR = 14 * LC = 14 * 0.005 cm = "

""750 mL of a 0.125 Molar Potassium Carbonate solution is prepared. How many grams of Potassium Carbonate are present in the solution?""

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

The problem requires us to calculate the mass of Potassium Carbonate (K₂CO₃) present in a given volume and molarity of solution. Here’s how we solve it:

*   **Step 1: Convert volume from mL to Liters:**

    We are given the volume of the solution as 750 mL. We need to convert this to Liters (L) because molarity is defined as moles per Liter.

    1 L = 1000 mL

    Therefore, volume in Liters = 750 mL / 1000 mL/L = 0.75 L

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of Potassium Carbonate (K₂CO₃):**

    Molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per Liter of solution:

    M = moles / Volume (in Liters)

    We are given Molarity = 0.125 M and Volume = 0.75 L.

    Therefore, moles of K₂CO₃ = Molarity * Volume

    moles of K₂CO₃ = 0.125 mol/L * 0.75 L = 0.09375 moles

*   **Step 3: Calculate the molar mass of Potassium Carbonate (K₂CO₃):**

    To find the mass of K₂CO₃, we need its molar mass. The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound.

    K₂CO₃:
    *   Potassium (K):  2 * 39.1 g/mol = 78.2 g/mol
    *   Carbon (C): 1 * 12.0 g/mol = 12.0 g/mol
    *   Oxygen (O): 3 * 16.0 g/mol = 48.0 g/mol

    Molar mass of K₂CO₃ = 78.2 + 12.0 + "

English Translation: A slide calipers has a main scale where the smallest division is 1 mm. The number of divisions on the Vernier scale is 10. What is the value of the Vernier constant in cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding Vernier Constant:** The Vernier constant (VC) is the smallest length that can be accurately measured using a Vernier calipers. It is the difference between the value of one main scale division and the value of one Vernier scale division.  A simpler, and more common, formula to calculate it directly is:

    VC = Value of one main scale division / Number of divisions on the Vernier scale.

*   **Given Information:**

    *   Value of one main scale division (MSD) = 1 mm
    *   Number of divisions on the Vernier scale (N) = 10

*   **Calculation:**

    VC = 1 mm / 10 = 0.1 mm

*   **Conversion to cm:**

    Since the question asks for the answer in cm, we need to convert mm to cm. We know that 1 cm = 10 mm, so 1 mm = 0.1 cm.

    Therefore, VC = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 0.1 cm = 0.01 cm

What is the percentage of oxygen in magnesium nitrate?

**2. Solution:**

To find the percentage of oxygen in magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO₃)₂), we need to follow these steps:

*   **Step 1: Determine the Chemical Formula and Molar Mass:**

    The chemical formula for magnesium nitrate is Mg(NO₃)₂.

    *   Molar mass of Mg = 24 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of N = 14 g/mol
    *   Molar mass of O = 16 g/mol

*   **Step 2: Calculate the Molar Mass of Mg(NO₃)₂:**

    Molar mass of Mg(NO₃)₂ = (1 × Molar mass of Mg) + (2 × Molar mass of N) + (6 × Molar mass of O)

    Molar mass of Mg(NO₃)₂ = (1 × 24) + (2 × 14) + (6 × 16)

    Molar mass of Mg(NO₃)₂ = 24 + 28 + 96

    Molar mass of Mg(NO₃)₂ = 148 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the Mass of Oxygen in One Mole of Mg(NO₃)₂:**

    There are six oxygen atoms in Mg(NO₃)₂.

    Mass of oxygen = 6 × Molar mass of O

    Mass of oxygen = 6 × 16

    Mass of oxygen = 96 g/mol

*   **Step 4: Calculate the Percentage of Oxygen in Mg(NO₃)₂:**

    Percentage of Oxygen = (Mass of oxygen / Molar mass of Mg(NO₃)₂) × 100

    Percentage of Oxygen = (96 / 148) × 100

    Percentage of Oxygen ≈ 64.86 %

The Bengali problem ""ইথিনের ৭ মোল আণবিক ভর কত?"" translates to ""What is the mass of 7 moles of ethene?"" in English.

**2. Solution:**

To find the mass of 7 moles of ethene, we need to know the molar mass of ethene (C₂H₄).

*   **Step 1: Determine the chemical formula of ethene.**

    The chemical formula of ethene is C₂H₄.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the molar mass of ethene.**

    The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the molecule.

    *   Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12 g/mol.
    *   Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1 g/mol.

    Therefore, the molar mass of C₂H₄ is:

    (2 * 12 g/mol) + (4 * 1 g/mol) = 24 g/mol + 4 g/mol = 28 g/mol

*   **Step 3: Calculate the mass of 7 moles of ethene.**

    To find the mass of 7 moles, we multiply the molar mass by the number of moles:

    Mass = (Number of moles) * (Molar mass)

    Mass = 7 moles * 28 g/mol = 196 g

**2. Solution:**

This problem requires understanding the geometry of a circle and how the second hand of a clock moves. We need to make some reasonable assumptions since the length of the second hand is not given in the original problem statement. Therefore, let's also assume that the length of the second hand of the clock is 15 cm, or 0.15m.

*   **Displacement vs. Distance:** It's important to note the difference between displacement and distance. The *distance* traveled by the tip of the second hand in one minute is the circumference of the circle it traces 60 times, which is important for a complete revolution. The *displacement,* however, is the straight-line distance between the starting point and the ending point.

*   **Revolution completes in 60 seconds:** A full rotation of the second hand covers 360 degrees or 2π radians, which take 60 seconds to complete.

*   **One minute:** In one minute, the second hand completes one full rotation, so the ending position is the same as the starting position.

*   **Displacement after a complete rotation:** Since the starting point and ending point are the same, the straight-line distance between them is zero.

Therefore, the displacement of the second hand after one complete rotation is zero.

A body has a mass of 2 kg and an initial velocity of 5 m/s. After 3 seconds, the velocity of the body becomes 8 m/s. What will be the force applied on the body in Newtons?

**2. Solution:**

We are given the following information:

*   Mass of the object (m) = 2 kg
*   Initial velocity (u) = 5 m/s
*   Final velocity (v) = 8 m/s
*   Time (t) = 3 s

We need to find the force (F) applied on the body.

First, we can find the acceleration (a) of the object using the following kinematic equation:

v = u + at

Where:
* v is the final velocity
* u is the initial velocity
* a is the acceleration
* t is the time

Plugging in the given values:

8 = 5 + a * 3

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

3 = 3a

Dividing both sides by 3:

a = 1 m/s²

Now that we have the acceleration, we can calculate the force using Newton's second law of motion:

F = ma

Where:
* F is the force
* m is the mass
* a is the acceleration

English: How many grams of decimolar hydrochloric acid are required to neutralize 10 mL of 0.2 Molar sodium carbonate?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Understand the Reaction**

    The neutralization reaction between sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is:

    Na₂CO₃ + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H₂O + CO₂

    This balanced equation shows that 1 mole of Na₂CO₃ reacts with 2 moles of HCl.

*   **Step 2: Calculate Moles of Sodium Carbonate (Na₂CO₃)**

    We are given:
    *   Volume of Na₂CO₃ solution = 10 mL = 0.01 L
    *   Molarity of Na₂CO₃ solution = 0.2 M

    Moles of Na₂CO₃ = Molarity × Volume
                       = 0.2 mol/L × 0.01 L
                       = 0.002 moles

*   **Step 3: Calculate Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) Required**

    From the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of Na₂CO₃ reacts with 2 moles of HCl. Therefore:

    Moles of HCl required = 2 × Moles of Na₂CO₃
                         = 2 × 0.002 moles
                         = 0.004 moles

*   **Step 4: Determine the Molarity of Decimolar HCl**

    ""Decimolar"" means 0.1 M.  So, the concentration of the HCl solution is 0.1 M.

*   **Step 5: Find the Volume of 0.1 M HCl Solution Needed**

    We know:
       * Moles of HCl required = 0.004 moles
       * Molarity of HCl solution = 0.1 M

    Rearranging the Molarity formula, we can find the required volume:
    Volume (L) = Moles / Molarity

The diameter of a wheel is 3.1416 meters. What is the circumference of the wheel in meters?

**2. Solution:**

We are given the diameter of the wheel and asked to find the circumference. We know the relationship between the circumference (C), diameter (d), and pi (π) is:

C = π * d

In this case, the diameter (d) is 3.1416 meters.  We will use the approximation π ≈ 3.1416.

So, C = 3.1416 * 3.1416 meters.

Calculating the product:
C = 9.86958736 meters (approximately)

However, given the value for the diameter and the instruction to solve a reasoning problem -- which seems to expect a more direct reasoning rather than an estimation -- it's likely that π is intended to be approximated as 3.1416

So,  C = π * d
If we assume π = 3. 1416 then C = d * d = d^2  So C = d^2.

Let's assume the question wants to check if the solver actually knows the perimeter of wheel when pie = 3.1416 can be d^2, where d is the diameter.

C = (3.1416)^2  =  3.1416 * 3.1416 = 9.8696509056 m.

As such a question is trying to verify comprehension of what the term pie means, we can safely assume the answer can be very closely approximated to:  π*d = circumference.

**2. Solution:**

To find the molecular weight of 3 moles of methane, we need to know the molecular weight of one mole of methane first. Methane has the chemical formula CH₄. The atomic weight of Carbon (C) is approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu), and the atomic weight of Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 amu.

Therefore, the molecular weight of methane (CH₄) is:

1 * (atomic weight of C) + 4 * (atomic weight of H) = (1 * 12) + (4 * 1) = 12 + 4 = 16 amu.

Since 1 amu is approximately equal to 1 g/mol, the molar mass of methane is 16 grams per mole (g/mol).

Now, to find the mass of 3 moles of methane, we multiply the molar mass by the number of moles:

Mass of 3 moles of methane = (3 moles) * (16 g/mol) = 48 grams.

A piece of wood is floated in water. What percentage of its volume will be submerged? (Density of wood = 0.40 x 10^3 kg/m³, Density of water = 1 x 10^3 kg/m³)

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Understanding the Principle:**  When an object floats, the buoyant force acting on the object is equal to the weight of the object.  The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged portion of the object.

*   **Defining Variables:**
    *   Let *V* be the total volume of the wood.
    *   Let *V<sub>sub</sub>* be the volume of the wood submerged in water.
    *   Let *ρ<sub>wood</sub>* be the density of the wood (0.40 x 10³ kg/m³).
    *   Let *ρ<sub>water</sub>* be the density of the water (1 x 10³ kg/m³).
    *   Let *g* be the acceleration due to gravity.

*   **Weight of the Wood (W<sub>wood</sub>):**
    The weight of the wood is given by its mass times the gravitational acceleration:
    `W<sub>wood</sub> = m<sub>wood</sub> * g`
    Since density = mass/volume, mass = density * volume. Therefore,
    `m<sub>wood</sub> = ρ<sub>wood</sub> * V`
    So, `W<sub>wood</sub> = ρ<sub>wood</sub> * V * g`

*   **Buoyant Force (F<sub>B</sub>):**
    The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged portion of the wood:
    `F<sub>B</sub> = m<sub>water displaced</sub> * g`
    The mass of the water displaced is given by the density of water times the volume of water displaced (which is the submerged volume of the wood):
    `m<sub>water displaced</sub> = ρ<sub>water</sub> * V<sub>sub</sub>`
    So, `F<sub>B</sub> = ρ<sub>water</sub> * V<sub>sub</sub> * g`

*   **Equating Weight and Buoyant Force (Floating Condition):**

**1. Translation of the Bengali problem into English:**

Dhaka Betar Kendra broadcasts programs on medium wave at 630 kHz. The velocity of the radio waves is 3 x 10^8 m/s. What is the wavelength?

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations:**

We are given the frequency and the velocity of a radio wave and asked to find the wavelength. We can use the following formula:

velocity (v) = frequency (f) * wavelength (λ)

Therefore, wavelength (λ) = velocity (v) / frequency (f)

Given:

*   Frequency (f) = 630 kHz = 630 * 10^3 Hz = 630000 Hz = 6.3 x 10^5 Hz
*   Velocity (v) = 3 x 10^8 m/s

Now, we can substitute the given values into the formula:

λ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.3 x 10^5 Hz)

λ = (3 / 6.3) x (10^8 / 10^5) m

λ = (3 / 6.3) x 10^(8-5) m

λ = (3 / 6.3) x 10^3 m

λ ≈ 0.47619 x 10^3 m

λ ≈ 476.19 m

Rounded to two decimal places, the wavelength is approximately 476.19 meters.

A 0.1-meter long string is used to suspend a 10-gram mass. What will be the period of oscillation of the mass?

**2. Solution:**

This problem describes a simple pendulum. The period of oscillation (T) of a simple pendulum depends on the length of the string (L) and the acceleration due to gravity (g).  The formula for the period is:

T = 2π√(L/g)

Where:
* T = Period of oscillation
* L = Length of the string (0.1 meters)
* g = Acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)

Now, let's plug in the values:

T = 2π√(0.1 / 9.8)

T = 2π√(0.010204)

T = 2π * 0.101015

T ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 0.101015

T ≈ 0.6345 seconds

Therefore, the period of oscillation of the mass is approximately 0.6345 seconds.

**1. Translation:**

The Bengali problem translates to:

""How much heat is required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of ice by 1 Kelvin?""

**2. Solution:**

To solve this, we need to know the specific heat capacity of ice. Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1 Kelvin (or 1 degree Celsius).

The specific heat capacity of ice (c) is approximately 2100 J/(kg·K).

Therefore, the amount of heat (Q) required is given by the formula:

Q = mcΔT

where:

*   m = mass of the ice (1 kg)
*   c = specific heat capacity of ice (2100 J/(kg·K))
*   ΔT = change in temperature (1 K)

Plugging in the values:

Q = (1 kg) * (2100 J/(kg·K)) * (1 K)
Q = 2100 J

Thus, 2100 Joules of heat are required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of ice by 1 Kelvin.

The problem in English is: ""How many grams of table salt are required to prepare 500 ml of a 0.2 molar solution?""

2. **Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between molarity (M), volume (V), and the number of moles (n) of solute:

*   Molarity (M) = moles of solute (n) / volume of solution in liters (V)

Also, we need to know the relationship between moles (n), mass (m), and molar mass (M_m):

*   moles of solute (n) = mass of solute (m) / molar mass of solute (M_m)

For table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl), the molar mass is calculated as follows:

*   Molar mass of Na (Sodium) ≈ 23 g/mol
*   Molar mass of Cl (Chlorine) ≈ 35.5 g/mol
*   Molar mass of NaCl (M_m) = 23 + 35.5 = 58.5 g/mol

Now, let's solve the problem step-by-step:

*   **Step 1: Convert volume to liters:**

    *   Volume (V) = 500 ml = 500 / 1000 = 0.5 liters

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of NaCl required:**

    *   Molarity (M) = 0.2 mol/L
    *   Volume (V) = 0.5 L
    *   Moles (n) = M * V = 0.2 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles

*   **Step 3: Calculate the mass of NaCl required:**

    *   Moles (n) = 0.1 moles
    *   Molar mass of NaCl (M_m) = 58.5 g/mol
    *   Mass (m) = n * M_m = 0.1 moles * 58.5 g/mol = 5.85 grams

A rod is placed between the jaws of a slide calipers, and the following readings are obtained: Main scale reading is 6 cm, Vernier coincidence is 4, and the Vernier constant is 0.1 mm. What is the length of the rod in cm?

**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**

*   **Identify the given values:**
    *   Main Scale Reading (MSR) = 6 cm
    *   Vernier Coincidence (VC) = 4
    *   Vernier Constant (VC) = 0.1 mm

*   **Convert Vernier Constant to cm:**
    Since we want the final answer in cm, we need to convert the Vernier constant from mm to cm.  We know that 1 cm = 10 mm, so 1 mm = 0.1 cm. Therefore,
    Vernier Constant = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 0.1 cm = 0.01 cm

*   **Calculate the Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):**
    The Vernier Scale Reading is calculated as: VSR = Vernier Coincidence * Vernier Constant.
    VSR = 4 * 0.01 cm = 0.04 cm

*   **Calculate the Total Reading:**
    The total reading is the sum of the Main Scale Reading and the Vernier Scale Reading.
    Total Reading = MSR + VSR = 6 cm + 0.04 cm = 6.04 cm

Therefore, the length of the rod is 6.04 cm.

5 grams of hydrogen gas is reacted with 30 grams of nitrogen gas. What is the total mass of the product?

2. **Solution:**

This problem highlights a fundamental principle in chemistry: The Law of Conservation of Mass. This law states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total mass of the reactants (the substances that react together) will be equal to the total mass of the products (the substances formed by the reaction).

In this scenario:

*   Reactants: Hydrogen gas and Nitrogen gas
*   Mass of Hydrogen gas = 5 grams
*   Mass of Nitrogen gas = 30 grams

Total mass of reactants = Mass of Hydrogen gas + Mass of Nitrogen gas = 5 grams + 30 grams = 35 grams

Since mass is conserved, the total mass of the product must be equal to the total mass of the reactants.

A particle moves along a circular path with a radius of 10 meters. What is the displacement in meters when it covers one-quarter of the circumference?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding the problem:** We need to find the displacement, which is the shortest distance between the starting point and the ending point, not the actual distance traveled along the circular path.

*   **Visualizing the path:** Imagine a circle. The particle starts at some point on the circle and moves along the circumference until it has covered 1/4 of the circle. This means it travels from one point to a point that is 90 degrees away along the circle's arc. The radius connects the center of the circle to both the starting point and the ending point, forming a right-angled triangle.

*   **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:** The displacement is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle where the two sides are the radii of the circle (both 10 meters). Let 'd' be the displacement.

    According to Pythagorean theorem:
    d<sup>2</sup> = (radius)<sup>2</sup> + (radius)<sup>2</sup>
    d<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>2</sup> + 10<sup>2</sup>
    d<sup>2</sup> = 100 + 100
    d<sup>2</sup> = 200
    d = √200
    d = √(100 * 2)
    d = 10√2

**1. Translation:**

Pavel said he had 11010 (binary) bananas. He divided the bananas among 1101 (binary) people. According to our decimal number system, how many bananas did each person receive?

**2. Solution:**

The problem involves binary numbers, so we need to first convert them to the decimal system before performing the division.

*   **Convert 11010 (binary) to decimal:**

    11010₂ = (1 * 2⁴) + (1 * 2³) + (0 * 2²) + (1 * 2¹) + (0 * 2⁰)
    = 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0
    = 26

*   **Convert 1101 (binary) to decimal:**

    1101₂ = (1 * 2³) + (1 * 2²) + (0 * 2¹) + (1 * 2⁰)
    = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1
    = 13

Now we know that Pavel has 26 bananas and distributes them equally among 13 people.  To find out how many bananas each person gets, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of people.

*   **Divide the number of bananas by number of people:**

    26 / 13 = 2

Therefore, each person received 2 bananas.

Problem: If two coins are tossed simultaneously, what is the probability of not getting two heads?

**2. Solution:**

Let's analyze the possible outcomes when tossing two coins. Each coin has two possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).
When two coins are tossed, the sample space (all possible outcomes) is:

S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}

So there are a total of 4 possible outcomes.

We want to find the probability of *not* getting two heads. This is the complement of the event of getting two heads.

Let A be the event of getting two heads.  A = {HH}.
The probability of getting two heads, P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes for A) / (Total number of outcomes) = 1/4.

The probability of *not* getting two heads is the complement of P(A), denoted as P(A').
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4

Alternatively, we can directly count the outcomes where we don't have two heads: HT, TH, TT. There are 3 such outcomes.
So, the probability of not getting two heads is 3/4.

10 grams of Sodium Hydroxide reacts completely with 5 grams of Carbon Dioxide. What is the mass of the salt produced in grams?

**Solution:**

To find the mass of the salt produced, we need to consider the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Since, the problem doesn't mention any specific salt, we assume Sodium Carbonate (Na2CO3) will be the major product.

The balanced chemical equation is:

2NaOH + CO2 -> Na2CO3 + H2O

1.  **Calculate moles of NaOH:**
    *   Molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 (Na) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) = 40 g/mol
    *   Moles of NaOH = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol

2.  **Calculate moles of CO2:**
    *   Molar mass of CO2 = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) = 44.01 g/mol
    *   Moles of CO2 = mass / molar mass = 5 g / 44.01 g/mol ≈ 0.1136 mol

3.  **Determine the limiting reactant:**
    *   From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2.
    *   So, 0.25 mol of NaOH would require 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 mol of CO2 for complete reaction.
    *   Since we only have 0.1136 mol of CO2, CO2 is the limiting reactant.

4.  **Calculate moles of Na2CO3 produced:**
    *   From the balanced equation, 1 mole of CO2 produces 1 mole of Na2CO3.
    *   Therefore, 0.1136 mol of CO2 will produce 0.1136 mol of Na2CO3.

If 73 grams of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is dissolved in 4 liters of solution, what is the molarity of the solution?

**2. Step-by-step Solution:**

*   **Step 1: Understand Molarity**

    Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  The formula is:

     Molarity (M) = Moles of solute / Volume of solution (in liters)

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of HCl**

    To find the number of moles of HCl, we need to divide the mass of HCl (in grams) by its molar mass.

    *   Molar mass of HCl:  1 (for H) + 35.5 (for Cl) = 36.5 g/mol

    *   Moles of HCl = Mass of HCl / Molar mass of HCl = 73 g / 36.5 g/mol = 2 moles

*   **Step 3: Calculate the molarity of the solution**

    We are given the volume of the solution as 4 liters.  Now we can use the molarity formula:

    Molarity (M) = Moles of HCl / Volume of solution = 2 moles / 4 liters = 0.5 mol/L

Aluminum has a valency of +3 and is represented by the symbol Al.
Phosphate is a polyatomic ion with a charge of -3, represented by the formula PO₄.

Since the charges are equal and opposite (+3 and -3), the aluminum phosphate molecule will be a simple combination of these ions in a 1:1 ratio. The chemical formula is AlPO₄ .

Now we count the number of atoms of each element in the formula AlPO₄:

*   Aluminum (Al): 1 atom

The problem states: ""What is the molarity of a solution if 500 mL of the solution contains 117 grams of sodium chloride?""

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

To find the molarity of the solution, we need to determine the number of moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) present in the given volume of solution. Molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution.

*   **Step 1: Find the molar mass of NaCl.**

    The molar mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 23 g/mol, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.5 g/mol.
    Therefore, the molar mass of NaCl is 23 + 35.5 = 58.5 g/mol.

*   **Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of NaCl.**

    We are given 117 grams of NaCl. To find the number of moles, we divide the mass by the molar mass:

    Moles of NaCl = (Mass of NaCl) / (Molar mass of NaCl) = 117 g / 58.5 g/mol = 2 moles

*   **Step 3: Convert the volume of the solution to liters.**

    We are given the volume as 500 mL. To convert to liters, we divide by 1000:

    Volume of solution = 500 mL / 1000 mL/L = 0.5 L

*   **Step 4: Calculate the molarity.**

    Molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution:

    Molarity = (Moles of NaCl) / (Volume of solution in liters) = 2 moles / 0.5 L = 4 mol/L

Therefore, the molarity of the solution is 4 mol/L.

What is the molecular mass of 9 moles of glucose?

**2. Solution:**

To find the molecular mass of 9 moles of glucose, we need to know two things:

*   The chemical formula of glucose, which is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
*   The atomic masses of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).

We can approximate these atomic masses as follows:

*   Carbon (C): 12 atomic mass units (amu)
*   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu
*   Oxygen (O): 16 amu

Now we can calculate the molecular mass of glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>):

Molecular mass of glucose = (6 * Atomic mass of C) + (12 * Atomic mass of H) + (6 * Atomic mass of O)
= (6 * 12) + (12 * 1) + (6 * 16)
= 72 + 12 + 96
= 180 amu

This means one mole of glucose has a mass of 180 grams (g).  To find the mass of 9 moles of glucose, we multiply the mass of one mole by 9:

A proper subset of a set is a subset that is not equal to the original set. In other words, it doesn't include the set itself.

*   **Total number of subsets:**  If a set has *n* elements, the total number of subsets (including the empty set and the set itself) is 2<sup>*n*</sup>.

*   **Proper subsets:** To find the number of proper subsets, we subtract the original set itself from the total number of subsets.  Therefore, the number of proper subsets is 2<sup>*n*</sup> - 1.

In this case, the set has 5 members (n = 5).

1.  Calculate the total number of subsets: 2<sup>5</sup> = 32.
2.  Subtract 1 to exclude the original set: 32 - 1 = 31.

Thus, the number of proper subsets is 31.

**1. Translation:**

The problem states: In a right-angled triangle, the perpendicular (altitude) and hypotenuse are 4 and 5 respectively. What is the base of the triangle?

**2. Solution:**

We are given a right-angled triangle. Let's denote the length of the perpendicular (altitude) as 'p', the length of the hypotenuse as 'h', and the length of the base as 'b'.

According to the problem:
*   p = 4
*   h = 5

We need to find the value of 'b'.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (base and perpendicular). Mathematically:

h<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> + p<sup>2</sup>

Now, we substitute the given values of 'h' and 'p' into the equation:

5<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>

25 = b<sup>2</sup> + 16

Now, we need to isolate 'b<sup>2</sup>':

b<sup>2</sup> = 25 - 16

b<sup>2</sup> = 9

Now, we take the square root of both sides to find 'b':

b = √9

b = 3

Therefore, the base of the right-angled triangle is 3.

**1. Translation:**

The heat capacity of some water kept in a container is 6090 Joules per Kelvin. What is the mass of the water in kilograms?

**2. Solution:**

We know that the heat capacity (C) of a substance is related to its mass (m) and specific heat capacity (c) by the following formula:

C = m * c

Where:

*   C is the heat capacity (in J/K)
*   m is the mass (in kg)
*   c is the specific heat capacity (in J/kg·K)

For water, the specific heat capacity (c) is approximately 4200 J/kg·K (this is a generally accepted value).

We are given:

*   C = 6090 J/K

We need to find 'm'.  Rearranging the formula to solve for 'm':

m = C / c

Substituting the given values:

m = 6090 J/K / 4200 J/kg·K

m = 1.45 kg

Pavel said he had 100000 (binary) bananas. He divided the bananas among 1000 (binary) people. According to our number system (decimal), how many bananas did each person get?

**2. Solution:**

First, we need to convert the binary numbers to decimal numbers to understand the quantities.  Then we can perform the division.

*   **Convert 100000 (binary) to decimal:**

    100000 (binary) = (1 * 2<sup>5</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>4</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>0</sup>) = 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 32

*   **Convert 1000 (binary) to decimal:**

    1000 (binary) = (1 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>0</sup>) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8

So, Pavel had 32 bananas and divided them among 8 people.

Now, we divide the number of bananas by the number of people:

32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, each person received 4 bananas.

A spherical ball with a radius of 4 cm fits exactly into a cylindrical box. What is the volume of the cylinder in cubic cm?

**2. Solution:**

*   **Understanding the Problem:** The key here is that the sphere fits *exactly* inside the cylinder. This means the diameter of the sphere is equal to both the diameter and the height of the cylinder.

*   **Finding the Dimensions of the Cylinder:**
    *   Radius of the sphere (r) = 4 cm
    *   Radius of the cylinder (R) = Radius of the sphere = 4 cm
    *   Diameter of the sphere (d) = 2 * r = 2 * 4 cm = 8 cm
    *   Height of the cylinder (h) = Diameter of the sphere = 8 cm

*   **Calculating the Volume of the Cylinder:** The volume (V) of a cylinder is given by the formula: V = πR²h, where R is the radius and h is the height.

    *   V = π * (4 cm)² * (8 cm)
    *   V = π * 16 cm² * 8 cm
    *   V = 128π cm³

*   **Approximating the Volume:** Using π ≈ 3.1416

    *   V ≈ 128 * 3.1416 cm³
    *   V ≈ 402.12 cm³

""What is the molecular mass of 3 moles of carbon monoxide?""

**2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

*   **Step 1: Determine the chemical formula of carbon monoxide.**
    Carbon monoxide is a chemical compound with the formula CO.  Each molecule contains one carbon atom and one oxygen atom.

*   **Step 2: Find the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen.**
    The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu).
    The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 atomic mass units (amu).

*   **Step 3: Calculate the molecular mass of carbon monoxide (CO).**
    Molecular mass of CO = (Atomic mass of C) + (Atomic mass of O)
    Molecular mass of CO = 12 amu + 16 amu = 28 amu

    Since 1 amu is approximately equal to 1 g/mol, the molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol.

*   **Step 4: Calculate the mass of 3 moles of carbon monoxide.**
    Mass of 3 moles of CO = (Number of moles) x (Molar mass of CO)
    Mass of 3 moles of CO = 3 moles * 28 g/mol = 84 g
