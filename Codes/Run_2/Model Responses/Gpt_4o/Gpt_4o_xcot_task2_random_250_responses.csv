What is the number of proper subsets of a set with 3 elements?

## Solution:
To find the number of proper subsets of a set, we must first understand what a proper subset is. A proper subset of a set is any subset that does not include all the elements of the original set.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to finding the number of proper subsets for a set with 3 elements:

1. **Determine the total number of subsets:**
   - If a set has \( n \) elements, the total number of subsets (including the empty set and the set itself) is determined by \( 2^n \).
   - For a set with 3 elements, the total number of subsets is \( 2^3 = 8 \).

2. **Identify the proper subsets:**
   - Proper subsets exclude the set itself. Therefore, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of subsets to exclude the full set.
   - The number of proper subsets is thus \( 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \).

Therefore, a set with 3 elements has 7 proper subsets.

**Problem:** If 5 grams of hydrogen gas is introduced into 1.27 x 10^24 chlorine atoms, how many grams of chlorine gas were there?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

### Step 1: Understanding Molar Mass and Mole Concept

First, we need to understand the molar masses of hydrogen (H2) and chlorine (Cl2) to solve the problem.

- **Molar mass of hydrogen gas (H2):** The atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1 gram/mol, so H2 is about 2 grams/mol.
- **Molar mass of chlorine gas (Cl2):** The atomic mass of chlorine is approximately 35.5 grams/mol, so Cl2 is about 71 grams/mol.

### Step 2: Convert Mass of Hydrogen Gas to Moles

We convert the given mass of hydrogen gas to moles:
\[ \text{Moles of H2} = \frac{5 \text{ grams}}{2 \text{ grams/mol}} = 2.5 \text{ moles} \]

### Step 3: Understanding Reaction and Chlorine Atoms

The problem states that 1.27 x 10^24 chlorine atoms are present. We need to convert these atoms into moles for easier calculations using Avogadro's number (approximately \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) atoms/mol).

\[ \text{Moles of Cl atoms} = \frac{1.27 \times 10^{24} \text{ atoms}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol}} \approx 2.11 \text{ moles} \]

Since Cl2 is diatomic, the moles of Cl2 present will be half of the moles of Cl atoms:
\[ \text{Moles of Cl2} = \frac{2.11}{2} \approx 1.055 \text{ moles} \]

### Step 4: Find Out Limiting Reactant

In the reaction of H2 with Cl2, they react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce hydrogen chloride (HCl). So, we need to compare the moles of H2 and Cl2:

- \(\text{Moles of H2 available} = 2.5\)
- \(\text{Moles of Cl2 available} = 1.055\)

The problem in English is: ""If you randomly draw one ticket from consecutively numbered tickets from 1 to 10, what is the probability that the ticket is a multiple of 2 or 3?""

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we must determine how many tickets between 1 and 10 are multiples of 2 or 3, then divide that number by the total number of tickets.

### Step 1: Identify the Multiples of 2
The multiples of 2 from 1 to 10 are:
- 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10

This gives us 5 tickets that are multiples of 2.

### Step 2: Identify the Multiples of 3
The multiples of 3 from 1 to 10 are:
- 3, 6, and 9

This gives us 3 tickets that are multiples of 3.

### Step 3: Consider the Overlap
We need to consider the numbers that are multiples of both 2 and 3, to avoid double counting. A number that is a multiple of both 2 and 3 is a multiple of 6.
- The multiples of 6 from 1 to 10 are: 6

This gives us 1 ticket that is a multiple of both 2 and 3.

### Step 4: Apply the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion
Let's calculate the total count of tickets that are multiples of either 2 or 3:
- Total multiples of 2 or 3 = (Multiples of 2) + (Multiples of 3) - (Multiples of both 2 and 3)
- Total = 5 (multiples of 2) + 3 (multiples of 3) - 1 (multiples of both 2 and 3)

Total = 7

### Step 5: Calculate the Probability
The probability that a randomly selected ticket is a multiple of 2 or 3 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
- Total number of tickets = 10
- Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
- Probability = 7 / 10

Thus, the probability that a randomly drawn ticket is a multiple of 2 or 3 is 7 out of 10.

The problem in Bengali is asking: ""When two coins are tossed together, what is the probability of getting at most one head?""

## Detailed Solution
To solve this problem, let's go through the possible outcomes when two coins are tossed:

1. **HH (Head, Head)**
2. **HT (Head, Tail)**
3. **TH (Tail, Head)**
4. **TT (Tail, Tail)**

Next, we interpret ""at most one head."" This means the possible outcomes should include:

- zero heads, which is the outcome: TT
- one head, which includes the outcomes: HT and TH

Now, let's enumerate the outcomes that satisfy the condition ""at most one head"":

- **TT:** 0 heads
- **HT:** 1 head
- **TH:** 1 head

Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes (TT, HT, TH).

The total number of possible outcomes when tossing two coins is 4, as listed above.

To find the probability, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \]

Substituting the numbers we determined:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Thus, the probability of getting at most one head when two coins are tossed is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

What is the concentration of a solution if 17.75 grams of sodium sulfate is dissolved in 450 milliliters of solution?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the concentration of the solution, we need to use the formula for concentration in terms of mass per volume, which is usually expressed in grams per liter (g/L).

#### Step 1: Understand the given values
- Mass of sodium sulfate (solute) = 17.75 grams
- Volume of the solution = 450 milliliters

#### Step 2: Convert the volume from milliliters to liters
Concentration is often expressed in terms of liters, so we need to convert the volume of the solution from milliliters to liters. Since 1 liter = 1000 milliliters, we have:
\[
\text{Volume in liters} = \frac{450 \text{ milliliters}}{1000} = 0.45 \text{ liters}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the concentration
The concentration \( C \) of the solution is given by the formula:
\[
C = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{volume of solution}}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
C = \frac{17.75 \text{ grams}}{0.45 \text{ liters}} = 39.44 \text{ grams per liter}

1. **Understand the Situation**: When the cow is tied and grazes in a circular pattern, the area it can graze is that of a circle. The formula for the area \( A \) of a circle is given by:
   \[
   A = \pi r^2
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

2. **Given Information**: We know the area of the circle \( A = 144 \) square meters.

3. **Use the Area Formula**: Substitute the known area into the area formula to solve for the radius \( r \):
   \[
   144 = \pi r^2
   \]

4. **Solve for the Radius \( r \)**:
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{144}{\pi}

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to find the central angle in radians for an arc of a circle given its diameter and the length of the arc.

### Step 1: Understand the Relationship
The length of an arc (s) in a circle is related to the radius (r) and the central angle (θ in radians) by the formula:
\[ s = r \times \theta \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Radius
We are given the diameter of the circle, which is 5 cm. The radius is half of the diameter:
\[ r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{5 \text{ cm}}{2} = 2.5 \text{ cm} \]

### Step 3: Apply the Arc Length Formula
We know the arc length \( s = 15 \text{ cm} \). We will plug it into the arc length formula to find \( \theta \):
\[ 15 = 2.5 \times \theta \]

### Step 4: Solve for the Central Angle (θ)
To find \( \theta \), we solve the equation:
\[ \theta = \frac{15}{2.5} \]

Calculating the division:
\[ \theta = 6 \]

A wheel covers a distance of 3.25 km by completing 25 revolutions. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?

## Detailed Solution with Explanations

To find the diameter of the wheel, first, we need to determine the circumference of the wheel because the circumference is the distance covered in one complete revolution by the wheel.

**Step 1: Convert the total distance from kilometers to meters.**

Given:
- Total distance covered = 3.25 km

We know,
1 km = 1000 meters

Therefore,
3.25 km = 3.25 × 1000 = 3250 meters

**Step 2: Calculate the circumference of the wheel.**

Total distance traveled by the wheel is the product of the number of revolutions and the circumference of the wheel.

Let C be the circumference of the wheel. Then,
\[ \text{Number of revolutions} \times \text{Circumference} = \text{Total distance} \]

Given:
- Number of revolutions = 25

Therefore,
\[ 25 \times C = 3250 \]

Solving for C:
\[ C = \frac{3250}{25} = 130 \text{ meters} \]

This means the circumference of the wheel is 130 meters.

**Step 3: Use the circumference to find the diameter of the wheel.**

The formula for circumference \( C \) of a circle in terms of diameter \( d \) is:
\[ C = \pi \times d \]

Given:
- \( C = 130 \) meters

Using this formula, solve for the diameter:
\[ d = \frac{C}{\pi} \]

Taking \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \),
\[ d = \frac{130}{3.14159} \approx 41.4078 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the diameter of the wheel is approximately 41.41 meters.

   What is the mass of water that is integrated into one molecule of silk?

2. **Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

   To solve this problem, we first need to understand what an ""integrated"" or ""bound"" water molecule means in the context of silk (or any protein or polymer). Typically, this refers to water that is associated with the molecular structure, often being part of the hydration layer. However, since the problem is not explicit about the chemical structure, we will consider it as a basic calculation related to hydrated molecules.

   Let's assume that silk is referring to a generalized molecule, and we want to find the mass of water associated with it, typically a common component like sericin or fibroin in silk.

   Next, since the problem asks for the mass of water in a molecule, we proceed as follows:

   - Water's molecular formula is \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \).
   - The molar mass of water (H\(_2\)O) is calculated by adding the atomic masses of its constituent elements:
     - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1 gram/mole, and there are 2 hydrogen atoms.
     - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 grams/mole.
   - Therefore, the molar mass of water = \( (2 \times 1) + 16 = 18 \) grams/mole.

   Since the question asks for one molecule, we need to use Avogadro's number, which is \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \), the number of molecules in one mole.

   - Mass of one water molecule = \(\frac{\text{Molar mass}}{\text{Avogadro's number}}\)
   - Mass of one water molecule = \(\frac{18 \text{ grams/mole}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules/mole}}\)
   - Mass of one water molecule ≈ \( 2.99 \times 10^{-23} \text{ grams} \)

3. **Conclude with the final numerical answer:**

What is the amount of work done in joules when an object tied to a string is rotated once in a vertical plane?

### Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of work done on an object moving in a circular path in a vertical plane. Here, we're considering work done due to gravitational force when the object completes one full rotation.

1. **Understand the Setup:**
   - When the object tied to a string rotates in a vertical circle, it moves from a certain height downwards, reaches the bottom of the circle, and goes back up to the same height.
   - The gravitational force acts downward, while the displacement of the object in a circular path periodically changes direction. 

2. **Concept of Work in Circular Motion:**
   - Work done by a force is given by the formula:  
     \[ W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta) \]
     where \( F \) is the force, \( d \) is the displacement, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and the displacement vectors.

3. **Work Done Over One Complete Circle:**
   - In a full circle, when returning to the starting point, the net displacement of the object is zero.
   - Gravitational work over a complete path effectively cancels out because the position returns to the starting height.
   - Calculating work by considering energy conservation, where potential energy gained equals potential energy lost, shows no net work for one full cycle.

4. **Calculating Work Done:**
   - When considering net work done over one complete rotation in a vertical plane:
     - The net work done by gravity on the object over one complete cycle is zero. This is because the object returns to its initial potential energy state (height).

Hence, when an object is tied to a string and completes one full rotation in a vertical plane, the work done by gravity is zero because the potential energy at the start and end points of one full rotation is the same.

**Step 1: Identify the actual yield.**

The actual yield is the amount of product actually obtained from the reaction, which is given as 150 grams of white powder.

**Step 2: Determine the theoretical yield.**

Blue vitriol is commonly known as copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (\(\text{CuSO}_4 \cdot 5\text{H}_2\text{O}\)). When heated, it loses water molecules and forms anhydrous copper(II) sulfate (\(\text{CuSO}_4\)), the white powder.

A 50 gram sample of fluorine is reacted with 4 grams of hydrogen gas. How much hydrogen will react with the fluorine?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

### Step 1: Determine the balanced chemical equation
The reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and fluorine (F₂) is as follows:
\[ \text{H}_2 + \text{F}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HF} \]
This equation shows that 1 mole of H₂ reacts with 1 mole of F₂ to produce 2 moles of hydrogen fluoride (HF).

### Step 2: Calculate the molar masses
- Molar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol (1 hydrogen atom is approximately 1 g/mol, so 2 hydrogen atoms make it 2 g/mol)
- Molar mass of F₂ = 38 g/mol (1 fluorine atom is approximately 19 g/mol, so 2 fluorine atoms make it 38 g/mol)

### Step 3: Calculate moles of fluorine available
Given 50 grams of fluorine (F₂):
\[
\text{Moles of F}_2 = \frac{\text{mass of F}_2}{\text{molar mass of F}_2} = \frac{50 \text{ g}}{38 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 1.316 \text{ mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate moles of hydrogen available
Given 4 grams of hydrogen (H₂):
\[
\text{Moles of H}_2 = \frac{\text{mass of H}_2}{\text{molar mass of H}_2} = \frac{4 \text{ g}}{2 \text{ g/mol}} = 2 \text{ mol}
\]

### Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant
- From the balanced equation, 1 mole of H₂ requires 1 mole of F₂.
- We have 1.316 moles of F₂ and 2 moles of H₂ available.

Since 1 mole of H₂ reacts with 1 mole of F₂, we can only use up to 1.316 moles of H₂ to react completely with 1.316 moles of F₂.
Thus, fluorine (F₂) is the limiting reactant because we don’t have enough F₂ to react with all available H₂.

Two angles have a sum of 60 degrees and a difference of 30 degrees. What is the measure of the larger angle?

### Solution

To solve this problem, we have two angles, which we'll call \( \angle A \) and \( \angle B \). We know two things:

1. The sum of the angles is 60 degrees:  
   \[
   \angle A + \angle B = 60
   \]

2. The difference between the angles is 30 degrees:  
   \[
   \angle A - \angle B = 30
   \]

We have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of \( \angle A \) and \( \angle B \).

#### Step 1: Add the two equations

By adding the two equations, we eliminate \( \angle B \):

\[
(\angle A + \angle B) + (\angle A - \angle B) = 60 + 30
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2\angle A = 90
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[
\angle A = 45
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute \( \angle A \) back into one of the original equations

We substitute \( \angle A = 45 \) into the first equation:

\[
\angle A + \angle B = 60
\]

\[
45 + \angle B = 60
\]

Solving for \( \angle B \):

\[
\angle B = 60 - 45
\]

\[
\angle B = 15
\]

#### Step 3: Identify the larger angle

We have found that \( \angle A = 45 \) degrees and \( \angle B = 15 \) degrees. Therefore, the larger angle is \( \angle A \).

How many grams of oxygen will react with 12 grams of magnesium?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry principles based on the chemical reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O₂), which forms magnesium oxide (MgO).

### Step 1: Write the Balanced Chemical Equation

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen is:

\[ 
2 \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO} 
\]

### Step 2: Determine Molar Masses

Next, we need to find the molar mass of magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O₂).

- Molar mass of Mg = 24.31 g/mol
- Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol (16.00 g/mol per O, thus 32.00 g/mol for O₂)

### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O₂. This implies that:

- 2 moles of Mg (2 * 24.31 g/mol = 48.62 g of Mg) react with 32.00 g of O₂.

### Step 4: Calculate Using Proportions

Since we have 12 grams of magnesium, we set up a proportion based on the molar relationship:

\[
\frac{48.62 \text{ g of Mg}}{32.00 \text{ g of O}_2} = \frac{12 \text{ g of Mg}}{x \text{ g of O}_2}
\]

Solving for \(x\), the amount of oxygen:

\[
x = \frac{12 \text{ g of Mg} \times 32.00 \text{ g of O}_2}{48.62 \text{ g of Mg}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{384}{48.62} 
\]

\[
x \approx 7.90 \text{ g of O}_2
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

Therefore, 12 grams of magnesium will react with approximately 7.90 grams of oxygen.

A mountain at a distance of 450 kilometers from a point forms a 7-degree angle. What is the height of the mountain in meters?

## Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:

To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to the opposite side (height of the mountain) and the adjacent side (distance from the point to the base of the mountain).

**Step 1: Set up the tangent function**

The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this scenario, we have:
\[ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{height of the mountain}}{\text{distance from the point}} \]

Given:
- \( \theta = 7^\circ \)
- Distance from the point = 450 kilometers

We need to find the height of the mountain, let's denote it as \( h \).

\[ \tan(7^\circ) = \frac{h}{450} \]

**Step 2: Calculate \(\tan(7^\circ)\)**

Using a calculator, we find:
\[ \tan(7^\circ) \approx 0.12278 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( h \)**

Plug the value of \(\tan(7^\circ)\) into the equation and solve for \( h \):
\[ 0.12278 = \frac{h}{450} \]

To find \( h \), multiply both sides by 450:
\[ h = 450 \times 0.12278 \]
\[ h \approx 55.251 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Step 4: Convert kilometers to meters**

Since we need the height in meters, convert 55.251 kilometers to meters by multiplying by 1000 (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters):
\[ h \approx 55.251 \times 1000 \text{ meters} \]
\[ h \approx 55251 \text{ meters} \]

The height of the mountain is approximately 55251 meters.

What is the value of gravitational acceleration 500 km above the Earth's surface? The mass of the Earth is \(5.98 \times 10^{24}\) kg and its radius is \(6.37 \times 10^6\) meters.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We need to calculate the gravitational acceleration at a height of 500 km above the Earth's surface. The formula for gravitational acceleration \(g\) at a distance \(r\) from the center of the Earth is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:

   \[
   g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}
   \]

   where:
   - \(G\) is the gravitational constant, approximately \(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2\),
   - \(M\) is the mass of the Earth (\(5.98 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\)),
   - \(r\) is the distance from the center of the Earth.

2. **Calculate the Distance \(r\):**
   Given the Earth's radius as \(6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\), and the height above Earth's surface \(h = 500 \, \text{km} = 500,000 \, \text{m}\), the distance \(r\) from the center of the Earth is:

   \[
   r = 6.37 \times 10^6 + 500,000 = 6.87 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}
   \]

3. **Substitute into the Gravitational Formula:**
   Using the known values:

   \[
   g = \frac{6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 5.98 \times 10^{24}}{(6.87 \times 10^6)^2}
   \]

   Calculating the denominator:

   \[
   (6.87 \times 10^6)^2 = 4.72 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^2

What is the percentage of hydrogen in chloric acid?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we'll first need to understand the chemical composition of chloric acid and then calculate the percentage of hydrogen in it.

### Step 1: Determine the Chemical Formula

Chloric acid is chemically known as \( \text{HClO}_3 \). This indicates that each molecule of chloric acid consists of:
- 1 Hydrogen atom (H)
- 1 Chlorine atom (Cl)
- 3 Oxygen atoms (O)

### Step 2: Understanding Atomic Weights

To determine the percentage of hydrogen, we need to know the atomic masses of each constituent element:
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1 gram/mol.
- Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic mass of approximately 35.5 grams/mol.
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 grams/mol.

### Step 3: Total Molecular Weight

Calculate the molecular weight of chloric acid:
\[ 
\text{Molecular Weight of } \text{HClO}_3 = (1 \times 1) + (1 \times 35.5) + (3 \times 16) 
\]
\[ 
= 1 + 35.5 + 48 
\]
\[ 
= 84.5 \text{ grams/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Percentage of Hydrogen

The percentage of hydrogen in a molecule is calculated by dividing the mass of hydrogen by the total molecular weight and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
\[ 
\frac{\text{Mass of Hydrogen}}{\text{Total Molecular Weight}} \times 100 = \frac{1}{84.5} \times 100 
\]
\[ 
\approx 1.18\%
\]

Hence, the percentage of hydrogen in chloric acid is approximately 1.18%.

The radius of a circle is 10 cm. What is the central angle (in degrees) corresponding to an arc length of 35 cm?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the central angle of a circle in degrees, given the arc length and the radius, we use the formula for the arc length of a circle:

\[ L = r \theta \]

Where:
- \( L \) is the arc length,
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle, and
- \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

In this problem:
- Arc length, \( L = 35 \) cm,
- Radius, \( r = 10 \) cm.

Rearranging the formula to solve for the central angle in radians:

\[ \theta = \frac{L}{r} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \theta = \frac{35}{10} = 3.5 \text{ radians} \]

Now, we need to convert the central angle from radians to degrees. The conversion formula is:

\[ \text{Degrees} = \text{Radians} \times \left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right) \]

Substitute the value of \(\theta\):

\[ \text{Degrees} = 3.5 \times \left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right) \]

Performing the calculation using the approximate value of \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):

\[ \text{Degrees} = 3.5 \times \left(\frac{180}{3.14159}\right) \]
\[ \text{Degrees} \approx 3.5 \times 57.2958 \]
\[ \text{Degrees} \approx 200.4893 \]

A bullet with a mass of 10 grams is fired from a gun at a speed of 400 meters per second. If the mass of the gun is \( \frac{3}{2} \) kg, what is the recoil speed of the gun in meters per second?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use the principle of conservation of momentum. According to this principle, the total momentum before firing the bullet is equal to the total momentum after firing the bullet.

### Step 1: Define the known quantities.
- Mass of the bullet (\( m_b \)) = 10 grams = 0.01 kg (since 1 gram = 0.001 kg).
- Speed of the bullet (\( v_b \)) = 400 meters per second.
- Mass of the gun (\( m_g \)) = \(\frac{3}{2}\) kg = 1.5 kg.

### Step 2: Understand the scenario before and after the shot.
- Before firing, both the gun and the bullet are at rest relative to each other, thus the initial total momentum is 0.
- After firing, the bullet moves forward, and the gun recoils backward.

### Step 3: Write the equation for the conservation of momentum.
The momentum before firing is 0 because neither the bullet nor the gun is moving. After firing, the momentum of the bullet and the momentum of the gun must sum to 0. Thus,

\[ 
m_b \times v_b + m_g \times v_g = 0 
\]

where \( v_g \) is the recoil speed of the gun.

### Step 4: Solve for the recoil speed of the gun (\( v_g \)).
Plug in the known values:

\[ 
0.01 \times 400 + 1.5 \times v_g = 0
\]

\[ 
4 + 1.5 \times v_g = 0
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 
1.5 \times v_g = -4 
\]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( v_g \):

\[ 
v_g = \frac{-4}{1.5}
\]

\[ 
v_g = -\frac{8}{3} 
\]

\[ 
v_g = -2.67 \, \text{m/s}

50 grams of fluorine is reacted with 4 grams of hydrogen gas. What is the volume of the reacted hydrogen gas at standard conditions (STP) in liters?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Chemical Reaction**:
   The reaction between fluorine (\(F_2\)) and hydrogen gas (\(H_2\)) is as follows:
   \[
   H_2 + F_2 \rightarrow 2HF
   \]
   This indicates that one molecule of hydrogen reacts with one molecule of fluorine to form two molecules of hydrogen fluoride.

2. **Molar Mass Calculation**:
   - Molar mass of \(F_2\) (fluorine) = 19 (for one \(F\)) × 2 = 38 g/mol
   - Molar mass of \(H_2\) (hydrogen) = 1 (for one \(H\)) × 2 = 2 g/mol

3. **Calculate Moles of Each Reactant**:
   - Moles of \(F_2\): 
     \[
     \text{Moles of } F_2 = \frac{50 \text{ grams}}{38 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 1.316 \text{ moles}
     \]
   - Moles of \(H_2\):
     \[
     \text{Moles of } H_2 = \frac{4 \text{ grams}}{2 \text{ g/mol}} = 2 \text{ moles}
     \]

4. **Determine Limiting Reagent**:
   According to the reaction stoichiometry (\(1:1\)), 1 mole of \(H_2\) can react with 1 mole of \(F_2\). 
   - Available: 1.316 moles of \(F_2\) and 2 moles of \(H_2\).

   Since the amount of \(F_2\) is less than the amount of \(H_2\), \(F_2\) is the limiting reagent.

""In 250 mL of a 0.2 Molar sodium chloride solution, how many grams of sodium chloride are present?""

### Solution:
To find the amount of sodium chloride present in grams, we need to understand the relationship between molarity, volume, and mass. 

1. **Understanding Molarity:**  
   Molarity (\(M\)) is defined as the number of moles of solute (in this case, sodium chloride, NaCl) per liter of solution.  
   \[ 
   M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}} 
   \]

2. **Given Information:**  
   - Molarity (M) = 0.2 Molar  
   - Volume of the solution = 250 mL
   
3. **Converting Volume to Liters:**  
   Since molarity is expressed in liters, we convert the 250 mL to liters.  
   \[ 
   250 \text{ mL} = 0.250 \text{ L} 
   \]

4. **Calculating Moles of Sodium Chloride:**  
   Using the formula for molarity, we find the moles of sodium chloride:  
   \[ 
   \text{Moles of NaCl} = M \times \text{volume in L} = 0.2 \text{ mol/L} \times 0.250 \text{ L}

What is the mass of 2 liters of chlorine gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of molar volume and molar mass.

### Step 1: Understand Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)
- **Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)**: This is defined as a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius (273.15 K) and a pressure of 1 atmosphere (atm). 
- At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters.

### Step 2: Determine Molar Mass of Chlorine Gas
- Chlorine gas (\( \text{Cl}_2 \)) is a diatomic molecule.
- The atomic mass of chlorine (\( \text{Cl} \)) is approximately 35.5 g/mol.
- Therefore, the molar mass of chlorine gas (\( \text{Cl}_2 \)) is:
  \[
  \text{Molar Mass of } \text{Cl}_2 = 2 \times 35.5 = 71 \text{ g/mol}
  \]

### Step 3: Use Molar Volume to Find the Mass of Chlorine Gas
- Given that 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP, we can find how many moles are in 2 liters of chlorine gas:
  \[
  \text{Number of Moles of } \text{Cl}_2 = \frac{\text{Volume at STP}}{\text{Molar Volume}}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Number of Moles of } \text{Cl}_2 = \frac{2 \text{ L}}{22.4 \text{ L/mol}} = 0.0893 \text{ mol}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Mass of Chlorine Gas
- Now that we know the number of moles, we can find the mass using the molar mass:
  \[
  \text{Mass of } \text{Cl}_2 = \text{Number of Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Mass of } \text{Cl}_2 = 0.0893 \text{ mol} \times 71 \text{ g/mol} = 6.35 \text{ g}

A mass of 5 kg is dropped from the roof of a 50-meter high building. What will its kinetic energy be just before it touches the ground?

## Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the kinetic energy of the object just before it hits the ground. This can be found using the principle of conservation of energy, specifically the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy.

### Step 1: Understanding Energy Conservation

1. **Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)** at the top of the building is converted into **Kinetic Energy (KE)** just before hitting the ground.
   
   - Initial GPE is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{GPE} = m \times g \times h
     \]
     where \( m = 5 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( h = 50 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Calculating Gravitational Potential Energy

2. Let's calculate the GPE:
   \[
   \text{GPE} = 5 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 50 \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   \text{GPE} = 2450 \, \text{Joules}
   \]

### Step 3: Applying Energy Conservation

3. According to the conservation of energy, the initial GPE is equal to the KE just before the object hits the ground since there is no other energy conversion involved (assuming air resistance is negligible).

Thus, the kinetic energy (KE) just before the impact is:
   \[
   \text{KE} = 2450 \, \text{Joules}
   \]

### Conclusion:

Therefore, the kinetic energy of the object just before it touches the ground is **2450 Joules**.

What is the molar volume of 7 grams of nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?

## Solution
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the molar volume of nitrogen gas under standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions, given that we have 7 grams of nitrogen. At STP (0°C and 1 atm), the molar volume of any ideal gas is 22.4 liters per mole.

**Step 1: Determine the molar mass of nitrogen.**
- Nitrogen is diatomic, meaning it exists as \( N_2 \).
- The atomic mass of nitrogen (N) is approximately 14.01 g/mol.
- Therefore, the molar mass of \( N_2 \) is \( 2 \times 14.01 = 28.02 \) g/mol.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of nitrogen.**
- Given mass of nitrogen \( = 7 \) grams.
- Molar mass of \( N_2 = 28.02 \) g/mol.
- Number of moles (\( n \)) is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{7 \text{ g}}{28.02 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.25 \text{ moles}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the molar volume of nitrogen.**
- At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.
- Calculate the volume for 0.25 moles of nitrogen:
  \[
  \text{Volume} = \text{moles} \times \text{molar volume per mole} = 0.25 \times 22.4 \text{ L/mole} = 5.6 \text{ L}

### Problem Translation
A coin is tossed three times. What is the probability that heads come up more times than tails?

### Step-by-Step Solution

To find the probability that heads show up more times than tails when a coin is tossed three times, we need to consider the possible outcomes and the favorable outcomes.

**1. Understanding Possible Outcomes:**

When a single coin is tossed, there are 2 possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).

When it is tossed three times, the total number of outcomes is given by:
\[
2^3 = 8
\]

These outcomes are:
1. HHH
2. HHT
3. HTH
4. THH
5. TTH
6. THT
7. HTT
8. TTT

**2. Identifying Favorable Outcomes:**

We need to find the scenarios where heads appear more frequently than tails in these three tosses. This occurs in the following cases:
1. Three heads and no tails (HHH)
2. Two heads and one tail 
   - HHT
   - HTH
   - THH

The outcomes where there are more heads than tails are: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH. 

**3. Counting the Favorable Outcomes:**

The favorable outcomes are: 
- HHH 
- HHT 
- HTH 
- THH

There are a total of 4 favorable outcomes.

**4. Calculating the Probability:**

The probability of getting more heads than tails is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

Thus, the probability \( P \) is:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

What is the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for -80.65 degrees Celsius?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, we use the formula:

\[ 
F = \left( C \times \frac{9}{5} \right) + 32 
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
- \( C \) is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

Given that the Celsius temperature \( C \) is -80.65 degrees, we will substitute this value into the formula.

1. **Multiply the Celsius temperature by \( \frac{9}{5} \):**

   \[
   -80.65 \times \frac{9}{5} = -80.65 \times 1.8 
   \]

   Calculation:

   \[
   -80.65 \times 1.8 = -145.17

2. **Add 32 to the result from step 1 to convert to Fahrenheit:**

   \[
   F = -145.17 + 32 
   \]

   Calculation:

   \[
   -145.17 + 32 = -113.17

To produce hydrochloric acid, 1 gram of hydrogen is mixed with 70 grams of chlorine. How many grams of chlorine will remain unreacted?

### Solution:

We begin by acknowledging the balanced chemical equation for the formation of hydrochloric acid:

\[
\text{H}_2 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HCl}
\]

This equation shows that one mole of hydrogen reacts with one mole of chlorine to produce two moles of hydrochloric acid.

**Step 1: Determine the molar masses.**

- The molar mass of hydrogen (\(\text{H}_2\)) is 2 grams per mole (since the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1 gram/mole and there are 2 atoms in \(\text{H}_2\)).
- The molar mass of chlorine (\(\text{Cl}_2\)) is 71 grams per mole (since the atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 grams/mole and there are 2 atoms in \(\text{Cl}_2\)).

**Step 2: Determine the moles of hydrogen and chlorine provided.**

- Given mass of hydrogen: 1 gram.
  \[
  \text{Moles of } \text{H}_2 = \frac{\text{given mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{1\ \text{gram}}{2\ \text{grams/mole}} = 0.5\ \text{moles}
  \]

- Given mass of chlorine: 70 grams.
  \[
  \text{Moles of } \text{Cl}_2 = \frac{\text{given mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{70\ \text{grams}}{71\ \text{grams/mole}} \approx 0.9859\ \text{moles}
  \]

**Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant.**

The reaction \(\text{H}_2 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HCl}\) shows that 1 mole of hydrogen reacts with 1 mole of chlorine.

- Available 0.5 moles of \(\text{H}_2\) would require 0.5 moles of \(\text{Cl}_2\) to fully react.

A rectangular solid has a length of 8 cm, a diagonal of 9 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is its width in cm?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we can use the three-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem. For a rectangular solid, the diagonal \(d\) relates to the length \(l\), width \(w\), and height \(h\) by the following equation:

\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
\]

Given:
- Length (\(l\)) = 8 cm
- Diagonal (\(d\)) = 9 cm
- Height (\(h\)) = 4 cm

We need to find the width (\(w\)). Substituting the known values into the formula:

\[
9 = \sqrt{8^2 + w^2 + 4^2}
\]

Calculating the squares:

\[
9 = \sqrt{64 + w^2 + 16}
\]

Simplifying inside the square root:

\[
9 = \sqrt{80 + w^2}
\]

To eliminate the square root, square both sides of the equation:

\[
9^2 = 80 + w^2
\]

Calculate \(9^2\):

\[
81 = 80 + w^2
\]

Isolate \(w^2\) by subtracting 80 from both sides:

\[
81 - 80 = w^2
\]

\[
w^2 = 1
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(w\):

\[
w = \sqrt{1} = 1
\]

Thus, the width of the rectangular solid is 1 cm.

What is the molecular weight of 15 moles of sulfur dioxide?

## Solution:
To find the molecular weight of 15 moles of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), we need to first determine the molecular weight of a single molecule of sulfur dioxide.

1. **Calculate the molecular weight of SO₂:**
   - The molecular formula for sulfur dioxide is SO₂.
   - Sulfur (S) has an atomic weight of approximately 32.07 g/mol.
   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16.00 g/mol.
   - Therefore, the molecular weight of SO₂ is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of SO₂} = (\text{weight of S}) + 2 \times (\text{weight of O}) = 32.07 \, \text{g/mol} + 2 \times 16.00 \, \text{g/mol}

     \[
     = 32.07 \, \text{g/mol} + 32.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 64.07 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]

2. **Calculate the molecular weight of 15 moles of SO₂:**
   - Since the molecular weight of one mole of SO₂ is 64.07 g/mol, for 15 moles it would be:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 15 moles SO₂} = 15 \times 64.07 \, \text{g/mol}

1 gram of hydrogen and 85 grams of chlorine react to produce hydrochloric acid. What is the remaining amount of chlorine at the end of the reaction?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To approach this problem, we need to consider the chemical reaction between hydrogen and chlorine to form hydrochloric acid. The relevant chemical reaction is:

\[ \text{H}_2 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HCl} \]

However, we are given hydrogen and chlorine not as diatomic molecules but presumably as atomic weights. Let's break this down into steps:

#### Step 1: Identify Molar Masses
- Molar mass of hydrogen (H) = 1 gram/mole
- Molar mass of chlorine (Cl) = 35.5 grams/mole

Considering diatomic molecules (as typically they react as diatomic):

- Molar mass of \(\text{H}_2\) = 2 grams/mole
- Molar mass of \(\text{Cl}_2\) = 71 grams/mole

#### Step 2: Determine How These React
According to the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of \(\text{H}_2\) reacts with 1 mole of \(\text{Cl}_2\).

- 1 gram of hydrogen corresponds to 0.5 moles of \(\text{H}_2\), considering \( \frac{1 \text{ gram}}{2 \text{ grams/mole}} = 0.5 \text{ moles} \).

Given that 0.5 moles of \(\text{H}_2\) is present, it will completely react with 0.5 moles of \(\text{Cl}_2\).

#### Step 3: Calculate Amount of Chlorine Required
- Since 1 mole of \(\text{Cl}_2\) has a mass of 71 grams, 0.5 moles of \(\text{Cl}_2\) will have a mass of:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ moles} \times 71 \text{ grams/mole} = 35.5 \text{ grams}
  \]

#### Step 4: Remaining Chlorine Calculation
- Initially, there was 85 grams of chlorine present.
- Chlorine used in the reaction is 35.5 grams.

Thus, the remaining chlorine will be:

On the same road, two objects weighing 15 kg and 10 kg respectively are approaching each other from opposite directions with speeds of 3 m/s and 5 m/s. They collide head-on and stick together. What is the speed of the combined mass in m/s after the collision?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to apply the law of conservation of momentum. The law states that in the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system remains constant.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial momentum of each object.

The momentum of an object is given by the product of its mass and velocity. Let's denote:
- The mass of the first object, \( m_1 = 15 \) kg
- The velocity of the first object, \( v_1 = 3 \) m/s
- The mass of the second object, \( m_2 = 10 \) kg
- The velocity of the second object, \( v_2 = 5 \) m/s

Since the objects are moving towards each other, their velocities have opposite signs. We'll consider the velocity of the first object as positive and the velocity of the second object as negative.

The initial momentum of the first object:
\[ p_1 = m_1 \times v_1 = 15 \, \text{kg} \times 3 \, \text{m/s} = 45 \, \text{kg m/s} \]

The initial momentum of the second object:
\[ p_2 = m_2 \times (-v_2) = 10 \, \text{kg} \times (-5) \, \text{m/s} = -50 \, \text{kg m/s} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total initial momentum of the system.

The total initial momentum, \( P_{\text{initial}} \), is the sum of the momenta of the two objects:
\[ P_{\text{initial}} = p_1 + p_2 = 45 \, \text{kg m/s} + (-50) \, \text{kg m/s} = -5 \, \text{kg m/s} \]

### Step 3: Apply conservation of momentum to find the final velocity.

Since the objects stick together after the collision, their mass combines, and we'll denote the common velocity after the collision as \( v_f \).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Vernier Constant**:
   - The vernier constant (also known as the least count) of the vernier caliper represents the smallest measurement that can be accurately read with the instrument. It is calculated as the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division.

2. **Details Provided**:
   - Main scale's smallest division: 0.5 mm
   - 19 main scale divisions = 20 vernier scale divisions

3. **Calculate the Length of Vernier Scale Division**:

where \( H \) is the hour hand and \( M \) is the minute hand.

Given that the time is 4:00:
- The hour hand, \( H \), is at 4.
- The minute hand, \( M \), is at 0.

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

A hydraulic press has a small piston and a large piston, with areas of 5 square centimeters and 25 square centimeters, respectively. If a force of 100 Newtons is applied to the small piston, what force will be exerted on the large piston?

## Step-by-Step Solution

To solve the problem, we can use Pascal's principle for hydraulic systems, which states that the pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. Mathematically, this can be expressed with the formula:

\[ \text{Force}_{\text{small}} = \text{Pressure} \times \text{Area}_{\text{small}} \]

\[ \text{Force}_{\text{large}} = \text{Pressure} \times \text{Area}_{\text{large}} \]

Since the pressure is the same on both pistons:

\[ \text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}} = \frac{\text{Force}_{\text{large}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{large}}} \]

Substituting the values provided:

1. Area of the small piston \(\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = 5 \, \text{cm}^2\).
2. Area of the large piston \(\text{Area}_{\text{large}} = 25 \, \text{cm}^2\).
3. Force on the small piston \(\text{Force}_{\text{small}} = 100 \, \text{N}\).

We wish to find the force exerted on the large piston \(\text{Force}_{\text{large}}\).

1. Calculate the pressure exerted by the small piston:

   \[
   \text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}} = \frac{100 \, \text{N}}{5 \, \text{cm}^2} = 20 \, \text{N/cm}^2
   \]

2. Use this pressure to find the force on the large piston by rearranging the pressure formula:

A force of 200 Newton is applied to a stationary object with a mass of 10 kilograms for 20 seconds. What will be the velocity in meters per second after 20 seconds?

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the final velocity of the object after a force has been applied for a specific period of time. We can use the principles of Newton's Second Law of Motion and kinematics to find this.

1. **Understand Newton's Second Law:**
   Newton's Second Law states that the force applied on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   F = ma
   \]
   where \( F \) is the force applied, \( m \) is the mass of the object, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

2. **Calculate the acceleration:**
   Given that the force \( F \) is 200 Newtons and the mass \( m \) is 10 kg, we can rearrange the formula to solve for acceleration \( a \):
   \[
   a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{200 \, \text{N}}{10 \, \text{kg}} = 20 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

3. **Use the formula for velocity after a period of time:**
   Since the object is initially stationary, the initial velocity \( u \) is 0 m/s. To find the final velocity \( v \) after time \( t \), we use the formula:
   \[
   v = u + at
   \]
   where \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \), \( a = 20 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( t = 20 \, \text{s} \).

4. **Calculate the final velocity:**
   Substitute the values into the equation:
   \[
   v = 0 + (20 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 20 \, \text{s}) = 400 \, \text{m/s}

If the length of the diagonal of a square is \(8\sqrt{2}\) cm, what is its area in square cm?

## Step-by-step Solution:

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Relationship in a Square

In a square, the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with two sides of the square. If \( s \) is the length of a side of the square, then by the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship between the side \( s \) and the diagonal \( d \) is given by:

\[
d = s\sqrt{2}
\]

Given:
\( d = 8\sqrt{2} \)

### Step 2: Solve for the Side Length

From the equation \( d = s\sqrt{2} \), substitute \( d = 8\sqrt{2} \):

\[
8\sqrt{2} = s\sqrt{2}
\]

Divide both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\):

\[
s = 8
\]

Thus, the side length \( s \) of the square is 8 cm.

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Square

The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:

\[
A = s^2
\]

Substitute \( s = 8 \):

\[
A = 8^2 = 64
\]

Therefore, the area of the square is 64 square cm.

""When a tetrahedron is tossed twice, how many sample points are there in the probability sample space?""

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the scenario involving a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron is a type of polyhedron with four triangular faces. In the context of probability, each face of the tetrahedron can represent one possible outcome. Therefore, when we throw a tetrahedron, there are 4 possible outcomes for each throw. We can label these outcomes as 1, 2, 3, and 4 for simplicity, corresponding to each face landing on top.

**Step 1: Determine the outcomes of a single toss**

When the tetrahedron is tossed once, there are 4 possible outcomes because it has 4 faces. We denote these outcomes as {1, 2, 3, 4}.

**Step 2: Consider the two tosses independently**

When the tetrahedron is tossed twice, each toss is independent. So, the total number of outcomes is determined by multiplying the number of possible outcomes of the first toss by the number of possible outcomes of the second toss.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of sample points**

- For the first toss, there are 4 possible outcomes.
- For the second toss, there are also 4 possible outcomes, regardless of the first toss result.

Thus, the calculation for the total number of sample points is:
\[ 4 \text{ (outcomes for the first toss) } \times 4 \text{ (outcomes for the second toss) } = 16. \]

Each pair in the sample space corresponds to one outcome of the first toss and one outcome of the second toss, represented as ordered pairs (a, b) where a, b belong to {1, 2, 3, 4}.

## Conclusion:
The number of sample points in the probability sample space when a tetrahedron is tossed twice is **16**.

What amount of nitric acid is required to prepare 1 liter of a 1 molar solution?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of molarity, which is a measure of the concentration of a solution. Molarity (\( M \)) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

### Step 1: Determine what is needed
We need to prepare 1 liter of a 1 molar nitric acid solution. This means that the solution must contain 1 mole of nitric acid (HNO₃) in 1 liter of solution.

### Step 2: Calculate the molar mass of nitric acid
The chemical formula for nitric acid is HNO₃. We calculate the molar mass by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms in this formula:
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1 g/mol.
- Nitrogen (N) has an atomic mass of approximately 14 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 g/mol.

Thus, the molar mass of HNO₃ is:
\[ \text{Molar mass of HNO₃} = 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 14 + 3 \times 16 \]
\[ = 1 + 14 + 48 \]
\[ = 63 \text{ g/mol} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the mass of nitric acid required
Since we need 1 mole of nitric acid to make a 1 M solution in 1 liter, we need 63 grams of HNO₃ because the molar mass of HNO₃ is 63 g/mol.

### Conclusion
To make 1 liter of a 1 M nitric acid solution, we need 63 grams of nitric acid.

What is the probability that a randomly chosen number from the natural numbers between 1 and 99 is a perfect square?

## Solution:

To find the probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 99 is a perfect square, we must first identify all the perfect square numbers within this range.

### Step 1: Identify Perfect Squares from 1 to 99

A number is a perfect square if it can be written as \( n^2 \), where \( n \) is an integer. We start by finding the perfect squares:

- The smallest perfect square is \( 1^2 = 1 \).
- The largest integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 \leq 99 \) is 9, because \( 10^2 = 100 \) which is greater than 99.

Thus, the perfect squares between 1 and 99 are:

\[ 1^2 = 1, \; 2^2 = 4, \; 3^2 = 9, \; 4^2 = 16, \; 5^2 = 25, \; 6^2 = 36, \; 7^2 = 49, \; 8^2 = 64, \; 9^2 = 81 \]

These numbers (\( 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 \)) are all the perfect squares in the range from 1 to 99.

### Step 2: Count the Perfect Squares

The total number of perfect squares within this range is 9.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Possible Outcomes

The total number of natural numbers from 1 to 99 is 99.

### Step 4: Calculate the Probability

The probability of an event is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the probability \( P \) is:

\[ P(\text{Perfect Square}) = \frac{\text{Number of Perfect Squares}}{\text{Total Numbers}} = \frac{9}{99} \]

This fraction can be simplified:

\[ P(\text{Perfect Square}) = \frac{1}{11} \]

### Conclusion:

The probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 99 is a perfect square is \( \frac{1}{11} \).

The diameter of the Earth is 12,800 km. Dhaka and Chittagong subtend an angle of 4 degrees at the center of the Earth. What is the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong in km?

### Solution:

To find the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong, we can use the concept of the arc length in a circle. The formula for the arc length \( l \) is:

\[ l = r \times \theta \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

#### Step 1: Calculate the radius of the Earth.

Given the diameter of the Earth is 12,800 km, the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:

\[ r = \frac{12800}{2} = 6400 \text{ km} \]

#### Step 2: Convert the angle from degrees to radians.

The central angle given is 4 degrees. We need to convert degrees to radians. We know that:

\[ 1 \text{ degree} = \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ radians} \]

So, 4 degrees in radians is:

\[ \theta = 4 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{4\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{45} \text{ radians} \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the arc length.

Substitute \( r = 6400 \text{ km} \) and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{45} \text{ radians} \) into the arc length formula:

\[ l = 6400 \times \frac{\pi}{45} \]

\[ l = 6400 \times 0.06981317 \, (\text{approximate value of} \, \frac{\pi}{45}) \]

\[ l \approx 446.4 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong is approximately 446.4 km.

When a train goes over a railway line, the temperature difference becomes 35 degrees Celsius. The coefficient of linear expansion for iron is \(34.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{per Kelvin} \). How much does the length of a 100-meter long railway line increase in centimeters due to heating?

### Solution:
We need to determine the increase in length of the railway line when it is heated. The increase in length \(\Delta L\) due to thermal expansion can be calculated using the formula:

\[ 
\Delta L = L_0 \times \alpha \times \Delta T 
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta L \) is the change in length.
- \( L_0 \) is the initial length of the object.
- \( \alpha \) is the coefficient of linear expansion.
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

From the problem we have:
- Initial length, \( L_0 = 100 \, \text{meters} \).
- Coefficient of linear expansion, \( \alpha = 34.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{per Kelvin} \).
- Temperature change, \( \Delta T = 35 \, \text{Celsius} \).

1. Convert the initial length from meters to centimeters, as we need the increase in centimeters:
   \[
   L_0 = 100 \, \text{meters} = 100 \times 100 \, \text{centimeters} = 10,000 \, \text{centimeters}
   \]

2. Use the formula for the change in length:
   \[
   \Delta L = 10,000 \, \text{cm} \times 34.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{per K} \times 35 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. Compute the change in length:
   \[
   \Delta L = 10,000 \times 34.8 \times 10^{-6} \times 35
   \]
   \[
   \Delta L = 10,000 \times 1.218 \times 10^{-3}
   \]
   \[
   \Delta L = 12.18 \, \text{cm}

What should be the speed of an object so that its momentum and kinetic energy are equal in magnitude?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to equate the magnitudes of an object's momentum and kinetic energy and solve for velocity. Let's define the terms and the corresponding formulas we're working with:

1. **Momentum (p):** Momentum is defined as the product of the object's mass (\(m\)) and its velocity (\(v\)).
   \[
   p = mv
   \]

2. **Kinetic Energy (KE):** Kinetic Energy is defined as half the product of the object's mass and the square of its velocity.
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]

We need to find the velocity at which the magnitude of the momentum is equal to the magnitude of the kinetic energy. Therefore, we set the magnitudes equal:
\[
mv = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Assuming the mass (\(m\)) is not zero, we can divide both sides by \(m\) to eliminate the mass from the equation:
\[
v = \frac{1}{2}v^2
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \(v\):
\[
v^2 = 2v
\]

Now, divide both sides by \(v\) (assuming \(v \neq 0\), as a velocity cannot be zero if momentum equals kinetic energy):
\[
v = 2
\]

Thus, the speed at which an object’s momentum equals its kinetic energy is 2 units (the specific units depend on the system used, such as meters per second in SI).

A solid metallic sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to create a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. What is the radius of the resulting cylinder in cm?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of volume conservation. When the sphere is melted and reshaped into a cylinder, the volume remains constant. Hence, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder.

### Step 1: Find the Volume of the Sphere

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere with radius \( r \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

In this problem, the radius \( r \) of the sphere is 6 cm. Thus, the volume of the sphere is:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 = \frac{864}{3} \pi = 288 \pi
\]

So, the volume of the sphere is \( 288 \pi \) cubic centimeters.

### Step 2: Relate it to the Volume of the Cylinder

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi R^2 h
\]

where \( R \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. According to the problem, the height \( h \) of the cylinder is 32 cm. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is:

\[
V = \pi R^2 \times 32
\]

### Step 3: Set the Volumes Equal

Since the volume of the sphere equals the volume of the cylinder:

\[
288 \pi = \pi R^2 \times 32
\]

We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides:

\[
288 = R^2 \times 32
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( R^2 \)

Divide both sides by 32:

\[
R^2 = \frac{288}{32} = 9
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( R \)

Take the square root of both sides:

\[

In a right-angled triangle, if the length of the perpendicular (height) is 3 and the base is 4, what is the length of the hypotenuse?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we will utilize the Pythagorean theorem, which is a fundamental principle in Euclidean geometry. According to the theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

Where:
- \( c \) is the hypotenuse,
- \( a \) is one of the other sides (typically the perpendicular),
- \( b \) is the other side (typically the base).

Given:
- \( a = 3 \) (the perpendicular),
- \( b = 4 \) (the base).

Now, apply these values to the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 \]

Calculate the squares:

\[ 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ 4^2 = 16 \]

Add these results:

\[ c^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \]

To find \( c \), take the square root of both sides:

\[ c = \sqrt{25} \]

\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 5.

The depth of water in a pond is 1 meter. How much Pascal pressure will be applied at its bottom?

### Detailed Solution:

To find the pressure at the bottom of a pond due to a column of water, we use the formula for hydrostatic pressure:

\[ P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure in Pascals (Pa).
- \( \rho \) is the density of the fluid (in kg/m³). For water, \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\).
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately \(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
- \( h \) is the height of the water column, in meters. Here, \( h = 1 \, \text{m}\).

The Vernier caliper has 50 divisions on the Vernier scale equivalent to 49 divisions on the main scale. If the smallest division on the main scale equals 1 millimeter, what is the Vernier constant in millimeters?

## Solution:

To solve the problem, let's break down the steps methodically:

1. **Understanding Main Scale and Vernier Scale Divisions**:
   - Each division on the main scale (MSD = Main Scale Division) is given as 1 millimeter.
   - 49 MSDs are equivalent to the length covered by 50 divisions on the Vernier scale (VSD = Vernier Scale Division).

2. **Finding Length of One Vernier Scale Division**:
   - Let the length of one Vernier scale division be \( v \).
   - Therefore, the total length of 50 Vernier scale divisions is \( 50v \).

3. **Establish the Relationship**:
   - Since 50 VSDs equal 49 MSDs, we can write the equation:
     \[
     50v = 49 \text{ MSDs}
     \]
     Since each MSD is 1 mm, it expands to:
     \[
     50v = 49 \times 1 \text{ mm}
     \]
     \[
     50v = 49 \text{ mm}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Length of One Vernier Scale Division**:
   - Solve for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{49}{50} \text{ mm}
     \]

5. **Determine the Vernier Constant**:
   - The Vernier constant (VC) or the least count of the Vernier caliper is the difference between one main scale division and one Vernier scale division: 
     \[
     VC = \text{MSD} - \text{VSD}
     \]
     \[
     VC = 1 \text{ mm} - \frac{49}{50} \text{ mm}
     \]
     \[
     VC = \frac{50}{50} \text{ mm} - \frac{49}{50} \text{ mm}
     \]
     \[
     VC = \frac{1}{50} \text{ mm}

A reaction is carried out between 10 grams of sodium hydroxide and 5 grams of carbon dioxide. How many grams of sodium hydroxide will remain after the reaction is complete?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to consider the chemical reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The reaction is:

\[ 2 \text{NaOH} + \text{CO}_2 \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

This indicates that two moles of sodium hydroxide react with one mole of carbon dioxide to produce one mole of sodium carbonate and one mole of water.

### Step 1: Calculate Moles of Each Reactant

- **Molar Mass of NaOH:**
  - Sodium (Na): 22.99 g/mol
  - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol
  - Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol
  - Molar mass of NaOH = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g/mol
- **Moles of NaOH:**
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = \frac{10 \text{ grams}}{40.00 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.25 \text{ moles}
  \]

- **Molar Mass of CO₂:**
  - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
  - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol (two atoms)
  - Molar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 + 2 \times 16.00 = 44.01 g/mol
- **Moles of CO₂:**
  \[
  \text{Moles of CO}_2 = \frac{5 \text{ grams}}{44.01 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.1136 \text{ moles}

Using 700 joules of electrical energy, an electric motor raises a 40 Newton weight object to a height of 10 meters. What is the efficiency percentage of the motor?

## Solution in English:

To find the efficiency of the motor, we need to calculate the work done by the motor in raising the object and then determine what percentage of the electrical energy was converted into this work.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the Work Done by the Motor:**
   The work done (W) in raising an object is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   W = \text{Force} \times \text{Height}
   \]
   Here, the force is equal to the weight of the object, which is 40 Newtons, and the height is 10 meters. 
   \[
   W = 40 \, \text{N} \times 10 \, \text{m} = 400 \, \text{Joules}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Efficiency:**
   The efficiency of the motor is given by the ratio of the useful work output to the total energy input, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. 
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Work Output}}{\text{Energy Input}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{400 \, \text{Joules}}{700 \, \text{Joules}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

3. **Simplify the Expression:**
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} \approx 57.14\%
   \]

Thus, the efficiency of the motor in converting electrical energy into mechanical work is approximately 57.14 percent.

In the combined use of the main scale and the vernier scale, the net measurement is 12.66 cm. If the vernier coincidence is 6, what is the vernier constant in mm? (Main scale reading is 12.6 cm)

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to understand how a vernier scale works and how the net measurement is calculated using the main scale and the vernier scale.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Main Scale Reading (MSR):** This is the measurement directly read from the main scale. Here, it is given as 12.6 cm.
   - **Net Measurement (NM):** This is the combined measurement from both the main scale and the vernier scale, given as 12.66 cm.
   - **Vernier Coincidence (VC):** This is the index or the line on the vernier scale that coincides with a line on the main scale. Here, it is 6.

2. **Calculating Vernier Scale Reading:**
   - The vernier scale reading (VSR) can be determined from the net measurement using the formula:
     \[
     VSR = NM - MSR
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     VSR = 12.66 \, \text{cm} - 12.6 \, \text{cm} = 0.06 \, \text{cm}
     \]

3. **Understanding the Vernier Constant:**
   - The vernier constant (VC) is the smallest measurement that can be accurately read using a vernier scale and is usually in mm.
   - It is defined as the difference in length between one main scale division (MSD) and one vernier scale division (VSD), often expressed in terms of vernier coincidence.

4. **Calculating the Vernier Constant:**
   - The VSR (0.06 cm) is obtained by multiplying the number of vernier coincidences by the vernier constant. Hence:
     \[
     VC \times \text{Vernier Coincidence (6)} = VSR
     \]
     \[
     VC \times 6 = 0.06 \, \text{cm}

According to the report received from the weather department, in the month of July, there were 10 days of heavy rain and 15 days of drizzle in Sylhet city. What is the probability that it did not rain on the 4th of July?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use the concept of probability. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Total days in July = 31 days
   - Days with heavy rain = 10 days
   - Days with drizzle = 15 days
   - We are looking for the probability of a day with no rain.

2. **Days with Rain:**
   - If it rained either heavily or drizzled on any day, we can count such days collectively.
   - Total days with rain = 10 (heavy rain) + 15 (drizzle) = 25 days

3. **Days Without Rain:**
   - To calculate the days with no rain, we subtract the days with rain from the total days in July.
   - Days without rain = Total days in July - Days with rain = 31 - 25 = 6 days

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that it did not rain on a randomly chosen day in July is given by the ratio of days without rain to the total number of days in July.
   - Probability that it did not rain on any given day in July = Days without rain / Total days in July = 6/31

5. **Requested Probability:**
   - Since there is no specific information about individual days, we assume that each day is equally likely to experience no rain.
   - Therefore, the probability that it did not rain on the 4th of July is the same as the general probability calculated for any day.

A matchstick is rubbed with 3 Newtons of force against a box. If the matchstick is pulled for 4 cm, how much energy in joules is expended in rubbing the stick?

### Detailed Solution

To find the energy expended in rubbing, we use the formula for work done (energy spent), which is given by:

\[ \text{Work Done (W)} = \text{Force (F)} \times \text{Distance (d)} \]

In this problem:
- The force exerted is \( F = 3 \, \text{Newtons} \).
- The distance over which the force is applied is \( d = 4 \, \text{cm} \).

However, we need to convert the distance from centimeters to meters to maintain consistent SI units, where:
\[ 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{meters} \]

Therefore, the distance in meters is:
\[ d = 4 \, \text{cm} = 4 \times 0.01 \, \text{meters} = 0.04 \, \text{meters} \]

Now, substituting the values into the formula for work done, we get:

After placing a rod on a slide caliper, the reading obtained is as follows: the main scale reads 4 cm, the Vernier coincidence (alignment) is 7, and the Vernier constant is 0.1 mm. What is the length of the rod in centimeters?

## Solution

To determine the length of the rod using a Vernier caliper, we need to understand the components involved:

1. **Main Scale Reading (MSR):** This is the reading on the main scale, which is given as 4 cm.
   
2. **Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):** This comes from the Vernier coincidence or alignment given as 7. The Vernier constant tells us how much each division on the Vernier scale represents. 

3. **Vernier Constant (VC):** This is the smallest measurement that can be read using the Vernier scale, provided as 0.1 mm. 

### Calculating the Vernier Scale Reading:

First, we convert the Vernier constant to centimeters for consistency in units since the final answer is required in centimeters:
   
\[ \text{Vernier Constant in cm} = 0.1 \, \text{mm} = 0.01 \, \text{cm} \]

The Vernier scale reading is calculated by multiplying the coinciding division number on the Vernier scale by the Vernier constant:

\[ \text{VSR} = \text{Vernier coincidence} \times \text{Vernier Constant} = 7 \times 0.01 \, \text{cm} = 0.07 \, \text{cm} \]

### Total Length Calculation:

The total length of the rod is the sum of the main scale reading and the Vernier scale reading:

\[ \text{Total Length} = \text{MSR} + \text{VSR} = 4 \, \text{cm} + 0.07 \, \text{cm} = 4.07 \, \text{cm} \]

Thus, the length of the rod is 4.07 cm.

1. **Heat Capacity (C):** It is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of an object by 1 Kelvin. It is given in Joules/Kelvin (J/K). In this problem, the heat capacity is 6150 J/K.

2. **Specific Heat (c):** This is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of 1 kilogram of a substance by 1 Kelvin. It is given in Joules per kilogram per Kelvin (J/kg·K).

3. **Mass (m):** This is the mass of the object we are considering, given in kilograms (kg). In this problem, the mass is 5 kg.

The relationship between these quantities is given by the formula:

\[ C = m \cdot c \]

Where:
- \( C \) is the heat capacity (6150 J/K),
- \( m \) is the mass (5 kg),
- \( c \) is the specific heat (in J/kg·K).

We need to find the specific heat \( c \), so rearranging the formula gives:

The diameter of a circle is 20 cm. What is the measure of the central angle of an arc that is 50 cm long?

## Detailed Solution:

To find the central angle of an arc, we need to apply the formula that relates the arc length, the central angle, and the radius of the circle:

\[ \text{Arc Length} = r \times \theta \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle, and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**Step 1: Determine the radius of the circle**

The diameter of the circle is given as 20 cm. Therefore, the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter.

\[ r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{20 \, \text{cm}}{2} = 10 \, \text{cm} \]

**Step 2: Use the arc length formula**

We are given the arc length \( L \) as 50 cm. We will use the arc length formula to find the central angle \( \theta \).

\[ L = r \times \theta \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 50 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times \theta \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( \theta \)**

\[ \theta = \frac{50 \, \text{cm}}{10 \, \text{cm}} = 5 \, \text{radians} \]

**Step 4: Convert radians to degrees**

To convert radians to degrees, we use the conversion factor \( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \).

The radius of the Earth is 6440 km. Dhaka and Chittagong subtend an angle of 5 degrees at the center of the Earth. What is the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong in kilometers?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the distance between two points on the surface of a circle given the central angle, we can use the formula for arc length. The arc length \( S \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
S = r \times \theta
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle.
- \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

### Step 1: Convert the Central Angle from Degrees to Radians

The central angle is given in degrees, so first, we need to convert it to radians. The formula to convert degrees to radians is:

\[
\theta(\text{radians}) = \theta(\text{degrees}) \times \frac{\pi}{180}
\]

Given that the central angle is 5 degrees, the conversion is:

\[
\theta = 5 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{36} \, \text{radians}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Arc Length

Now, using the arc length formula:

\[
S = r \times \theta
\]

Substitute the values for \( r \) and \( \theta \):

\[
S = 6440 \times \frac{\pi}{36}
\]

To calculate \( S \), perform the multiplication:

\[
S \approx 6440 \times 0.0872665 = 562.048 \, \text{km}
\]

### Conclusion:

Thus, the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong along the surface of the Earth is approximately 562 kilometers.

A mountain creates an angle of 2.50 radians at a point 150 kilometers away. How high is the mountain in kilometers?

### Solution
To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a right-angled triangle. The distance from the point to the base of the mountain can be considered as one leg of a right triangle, the mountain's height as the opposite side in this right triangle, and the line of sight to the top of the mountain as the hypotenuse. The angle given is at the point where the observer stands, and the problem uses this angle to project the height of the mountain.

#### Step-by-step Solution:
1. **Understanding the relationship:**
   - We know the distance from the observer to the base of the mountain is the adjacent side to the angle.
   - The angle at the point where the observer stands is 2.50 radians.
   - The height of the mountain is the opposite side of the triangle.

2. **Using the tangent trigonometric function:**
   - In a right triangle, \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\), where \(\theta\) is the angle.
   - Here, \(\theta = 2.50\) radians.

3. **Setting up the equation:**
   - Let the height of the mountain be \(h\).
   - The distance from the observer to the base of the mountain is 150 km.
   \[
   \tan(2.50) = \frac{h}{150}
   \]

4. **Solve for the height \(h\):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(h\):
   \[
   h = 150 \times \tan(2.50)
   \]
   - Calculate using a scientific calculator to find \(\tan(2.50)\).

5. **Perform the calculation:**
   - \(\tan(2.50) \approx -0.7470\) (note: tangent for angles beyond \( \pi/2 \) enters into negative domain; considering the realistic application, we take modulus)
   - Therefore, \(|h| \approx 150 \times 0.7470 = 112.05\)

### Conclusion
The height of the mountain is approximately 112.05 kilometers. Since we typically do not consider negative heights in practical scenarios, the absolute value confirms the realistic interpretation of height.

What is the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas at standard conditions?

## Detailed Solution

To solve this problem, we need to use the ideal gas law and the concept of molar volume of a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP). At STP, which is defined as a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius (273.15 Kelvin) and a pressure of 1 atmosphere (atm), one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.

### Step 1: Determine the number of moles of hydrogen.

The molecular weight of hydrogen gas (H₂) is 2 grams per mole. This is because each hydrogen atom has an atomic weight of 1 amu, and there are two hydrogen atoms in each H₂ molecule.

\[
\text{Number of moles of hydrogen} = \frac{\text{Mass of hydrogen}}{\text{Molar mass of hydrogen}} = \frac{2 \text{ grams}}{2 \text{ grams/mole}} = 1 \text{ mole}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the volume using the molar volume of gas at STP.

Since 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters at STP, the volume of 1 mole of hydrogen gas is:

\[
\text{Volume of hydrogen} = 1 \text{ mole} \times 22.4 \text{ liters/mole} = 22.4 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas at standard conditions is 22.4 liters.

A 0.2 molar solution of potassium carbonate was prepared in 500 mL. How many grams of potassium carbonate are present in the solution?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mass of potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃) present in a 0.2 M (molar) solution over a volume of 500 mL.

1. **Understand the Molarity Concept**:
   Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute (in this case, potassium carbonate) per liter of solution. Mathematically, it is represented as:
   \[
   M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Moles of Potassium Carbonate**:
   Given that the molarity (M) is 0.2 M and the volume of the solution is 500 mL, first, convert the volume from milliliters to liters:
   \[
   \text{Volume in liters} = \frac{500 \text{ mL}}{1000} = 0.5 \text{ L}
   \]
   Now, use the formula for molarity to find the moles of potassium carbonate:
   \[
   \text{Moles of K}_2\text{CO}_3 = M \times \text{Volume in liters} = 0.2 \text{ mol/L} \times 0.5 \text{ L} = 0.1 \text{ mol}
   \]

3. **Determine the Molar Mass of Potassium Carbonate (K₂CO₃)**:
   The chemical formula K₂CO₃ consists of:
   - 2 Potassium (K) atoms, each with an atomic mass of approximately 39.1 g/mol
   - 1 Carbon (C) atom, with an atomic mass of approximately 12.0 g/mol
   - 3 Oxygen (O) atoms, each with an atomic mass of approximately 16.0 g/mol

   Calculate the molar mass:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of K}_2\text{CO}_3 = (2 \times 39.1) + (1 \times 12.0) + (3 \times 16.0)

At 8:20 AM, what will be the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock?

### Solution:
To determine the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Movement of Clock Hands:**
   - A clock is a circle consisting of 360 degrees.
   - There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is apart by \( \frac{360}{12} = 30\) degrees.
   - A full cycle of the minute hand is 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so each minute mark is apart by \( \frac{360}{60} = 6\) degrees.

2. **Position of the Hour Hand:**
   - The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour.
   - At 8:00, the hour hand is at \( 8 \times 30 = 240\) degrees.
   - For each minute, the hour hand moves an additional \( \frac{1}{2}\) degree (since it moves 30 degrees an hour, 30 degrees/60 minutes = 0.5 degrees per minute).
   - At 20 minutes past the hour, the hour hand moves an extra \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10\) degrees.
   - Therefore, at 8:20, the position of the hour hand is \( 240 + 10 = 250\) degrees.

3. **Position of the Minute Hand:**
   - The minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute.
   - At 20 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is at \( 20 \times 6 = 120\) degrees.

4. **Calculate the Angle:**
   - The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their positions.
   - Angle = \( |250 - 120| = 130\) degrees.

5. **Consider Smaller Angle:**
   - Clock angles can be calculated as either the position difference or \( 360\) degrees minus the difference to reflect both possible rotational paths.
   - For this time, however, \( 130\) degrees is the smaller angle, and the one typically considered within a 360-degree clock cycle.

### Conclusion:
The angle between the hour and minute hands of the clock at 8:20 is 130 degrees.

A sealed container holds 0.25 cubic meters of gas. The pressure of the gas is 27 x 10^3 Pascals, and the temperature is 40 degrees Celsius. Determine the amount of gas. (The gas constant value is 8.314)

### Solution
To solve this problem, we will use the Ideal Gas Law, which is given by the formula:

\[ PV = nRT \]

where:
- \( P \) is the pressure of the gas,
- \( V \) is the volume of the gas,
- \( n \) is the number of moles of the gas,
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant,
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

Let's break down the steps one by one:

1. **Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin**:  
   The formula for converting Celsius to Kelvin is:  
   \[ T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15 \]  
   Given, temperature \( T = 40°C \). Thus:  
   \[ T = 40 + 273.15 = 313.15 \, \text{K} \]

2. **Use the Ideal Gas Law to find the number of moles \( n \)**:  
   Given values are:
   - Pressure \( P = 27 \times 10^3 \, \text{Pa} \)
   - Volume \( V = 0.25 \, \text{m}^3 \)
   - Gas constant \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol} \cdot \text{K} \)
   - Temperature \( T = 313.15 \, \text{K} \)

   Substituting into the ideal gas law equation:  
   \[ (27 \times 10^3) \times 0.25 = n \times 8.314 \times 313.15 \]

3. **Reorganize the equation to solve for \( n \)**:  
   \[ n = \frac{(27 \times 10^3) \times 0.25}{8.314 \times 313.15} \]

4. **Calculate \( n \)**:

What is the probability of getting head or tail when a coin is tossed, if this event is a certain event?

## Step 2: Provide a detailed step-by-step solution.

When a single coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes: getting a ""head"" (H) or a ""tail"" (T).

An ""event"" in probability theory refers to a set of outcomes. A ""certain event"" is one that is sure to happen, meaning it covers all possible outcomes of the experiment.

1. **Possible Outcomes of Tossing a Coin:**  
   There are exactly two possible outcomes when tossing a coin:
   - Head (H)
   - Tail (T)

2. **Understanding the ""Certain Event"":**  
   In this context, receiving either a head or a tail covers all possible outcomes when a coin is tossed. Therefore, this event is ""certain"" because there are no other possible outcomes in a standard coin toss.

3. **Probability Calculation:**  
   The probability of an event that is certain to occur is always 1. This is because the probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. 

   \[
   P(\text{Getting a head or tail}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}}
   \]

   Given that getting a ""head"" or ""tail"" accounts for all possible outcomes, we have:

   \[
   P(\text{Getting a head or tail}) = \frac{2}{2} = 1
   \]

## Conclusion

Since receiving either a head or a tail is a certain event when a coin is tossed, the probability of this event is 1.

5 grams of hydrogen gas are reacted with 30 grams of nitrogen gas. How many moles of nitrogen will remain unreacted?

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the limiting reagent in the reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form ammonia (NH₃), according to the chemical reaction:

\[ \text{N}_2 + 3\text{H}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3 \]

**Step 1: Determine the number of moles of each reactant.**

1. **Hydrogen (H₂):**
   - Molar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol.
   - Grams of H₂ provided = 5 grams.
   - Moles of H₂ = \(\frac{5 \text{ grams}}{2 \text{ g/mol}} = 2.5 \text{ moles}\).

2. **Nitrogen (N₂):**
   - Molar mass of N₂ = 28 g/mol.
   - Grams of N₂ provided = 30 grams.
   - Moles of N₂ = \(\frac{30 \text{ grams}}{28 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 1.07 \text{ moles}\).

**Step 2: Determine the limiting reagent.**

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of N₂ reacts with 3 moles of H₂. Thus, for 1.07 moles of N₂, the required moles of H₂ would be:

\[ 3 \times 1.07 = 3.21 \text{ moles of H}_2 \]

However, only 2.5 moles of H₂ are available. Hence, hydrogen (H₂) is the limiting reagent.

**Step 3: Calculate how much nitrogen reacts.**

Since 3 moles of H₂ react with 1 mole of N₂, for 2.5 moles of H₂, the reacted moles of N₂ are:

\[ \frac{2.5 \text{ moles of H}_2}{3} = 0.833 \text{ moles of N}_2 \]

**Step 4: Determine the unreacted moles of nitrogen.**

Initially, there were approximately 1.07 moles of N₂. Therefore, the moles of N₂ remaining unreacted are:

In a 500 ml solution, if 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved, what is the concentration of the solution?

### Step-by-Step Solution
To find the concentration of a solution, we typically use the unit grams per liter (g/L). Here, we have the amount of solute (sulfuric acid) and the volume of the solution. We need to convert the volume from milliliters to liters to find the concentration.

**Step 1: Convert the volume from milliliters to liters.**

The given volume of the solution is 500 ml. We know that:
\[ 1 \text{ liter} = 1000 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, to convert 500 ml to liters, we divide by 1000:
\[ 500 \text{ ml} = \frac{500}{1000} \text{ L} = 0.5 \text{ L} \]

**Step 2: Use the formula for concentration.**

The formula for concentration in g/L is:
\[ \text{Concentration (g/L)} = \frac{\text{mass of solute (g)}}{\text{volume of solution (L)}} \]

We are given:
- Mass of sulfuric acid (solute) = 24.5 grams
- Volume of solution = 0.5 liters

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Concentration (g/L)} = \frac{24.5 \text{ grams}}{0.5 \text{ liters}} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the concentration.**

\[ \text{Concentration (g/L)} = \frac{24.5}{0.5} = 49 \text{ g/L} \]

To find the percentage of carbon in glucose, we need to know the molecular formula of glucose and the atomic masses of the elements involved.

1. **Molecular Formula of Glucose:**
   Glucose has the molecular formula \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 \).

2. **Calculate the Molar Mass of Glucose:**
   - **Carbon (C):** There are 6 carbon atoms, and the atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12 u. 
     \[
     \text{Mass of Carbon} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \, \text{u}
     \]
   - **Hydrogen (H):** There are 12 hydrogen atoms, and the atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1 u.
     \[
     \text{Mass of Hydrogen} = 12 \times 1 = 12 \, \text{u}
     \]
   - **Oxygen (O):** There are 6 oxygen atoms, and the atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16 u.
     \[
     \text{Mass of Oxygen} = 6 \times 16 = 96 \, \text{u}
     \]

3. **Total Molar Mass of Glucose:**
   \[
   \text{Total Molar Mass of Glucose} = 72 + 12 + 96 = 180 \, \text{u}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Percentage of Carbon in Glucose:**
   The percentage of carbon in glucose can be calculated by dividing the total mass of carbon by the total molar mass of glucose and then multiplying by 100.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Carbon} = \left( \frac{72}{180} \right) \times 100

When an object is dropped from the roof of a building that is 50 meters high, with what speed will it hit the ground?

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed at which the object hits the ground when dropped from a height. We will assume that the only force acting on the object is gravity, and we will ignore any effects of air resistance.

### Known Data:
- Initial height (h) = 50 meters
- Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s (since the object is initially at rest)
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s² (standard gravitational acceleration)

### Formula to Use:
The final velocity (v) of an object in free fall can be determined using the following equation derived from the equations of motion under constant acceleration:

\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2gh \]

Since the initial velocity \( u = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:

\[ v^2 = 2gh \]

### Calculation:
1. Substitute the known values into the equation:
   \[ v^2 = 2 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 50 \, \text{m} \]

2. Calculate the right side of the equation:
   \[ v^2 = 980 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \]

3. Find the square root of both sides to solve for \( v \):
   \[ v = \sqrt{980} \]

4. Compute the square root:
   \[ v \approx 31.3 \, \text{m/s} \]

Therefore, the object will hit the ground with a speed of approximately 31.3 meters per second.

The problem is asking: ""What is the molecular weight of 12 moles of perchloric acid?""

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the molecular weight (molar mass) of perchloric acid (HClO₄), and then calculate the total mass for 12 moles.

### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Weight of Perchloric Acid (HClO₄)

Perchloric acid is composed of:
- Hydrogen (H)
- Chlorine (Cl)
- Oxygen (O)

The atomic masses for these elements are approximately:
- Hydrogen (H): 1 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.5 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16 g/mol

Using the chemical formula HClO₄, we find the molar mass (molecular weight) by adding together the masses of each constituent atom:
- For 1 H: \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- For 1 Cl: \( 1 \times 35.5 = 35.5 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- For 4 O: \( 4 \times 16 = 64 \, \text{g/mol} \)

Adding these together, the molecular weight of HClO₄:
\[ 1 + 35.5 + 64 = 100.5 \, \text{g/mol} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Mass of 12 Moles of Perchloric Acid

Now, we need to find out the total mass of 12 moles of perchloric acid. This is done by multiplying the molecular weight of HClO₄ by the number of moles:
\[ 12 \, \text{moles} \times 100.5 \, \text{g/mol} = 1206 \, \text{g} \]

1. **Understanding the Chemical Reaction:**
   
   The reaction between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl₂) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) is given by the balanced chemical equation:

   \[
   2 \text{Na} + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{NaCl}
   \]

   This equation indicates that 2 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of chlorine gas to produce 2 moles of sodium chloride.

2. **Molar Mass Calculation:**
   
   - Molar mass of sodium (Na) = 23 g/mol
   - Molar mass of chlorine gas (Cl₂) = 35.5 g/mol × 2 = 71 g/mol

3. **Determining Moles of Reactants:**

   - Moles of sodium = 40 g / 23 g/mol = 1.739 moles
   - Moles of chlorine gas = 35.5 g / 71 g/mol = 0.5 moles

4. **Comparison to the Stoichiometric Ratios:**

   From the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of sodium reacts with 1 mole of chlorine gas. Since we have 0.5 moles of chlorine gas available for the reaction:

   - Required moles of sodium for 0.5 moles of Cl₂ = 2 × 0.5 = 1 mole of Na

5. **Calculating Remaining Sodium:**

   Initially, we have 1.739 moles of sodium and, based on the reaction, only 1 mole of sodium will react with 0.5 moles of chlorine gas.

   - Moles of sodium remaining = Initial moles of sodium - Moles of sodium reacted
   - Moles of sodium remaining = 1.739 moles - 1 mole = 0.739 moles

6. **Converting Moles of Remaining Sodium to Grams:**

   - Grams of remaining sodium = Moles of remaining sodium × Molar mass of sodium
   - Grams of remaining sodium = 0.739 m"

A mass of 10 grams is dropped from a height of 60 meters above the ground. What will be the momentum of the object, in kg-m/s, after 3 seconds?

**Solution:**

To find the momentum of the object after 3 seconds, we follow the steps below:

1. **Convert mass from grams to kilograms:**
   - The given mass is 10 grams. 
   - To convert grams to kilograms, divide by 1000.
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \frac{10 \text{ grams}}{1000} = 0.01 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Determine the velocity of the object after 3 seconds:**
   - The object is in free fall, so we will use the kinematic equation for velocity under constant acceleration due to gravity.
   - The acceleration due to gravity \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
   - The initial velocity \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \), as the object is dropped.
   - The time \( t = 3 \) seconds.
   - Use the formula for final velocity under constant acceleration: 
     \[
     v = u + gt
     \]
   \[
   v = 0 + (9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2)(3 \, \text{s}) = 29.4 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

3. **Calculate the momentum of the object:**
   - Momentum (\( p \)) is given by the formula:
     \[
     p = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}
     \]
   \[
   p = 0.01 \, \text{kg} \times 29.4 \, \text{m/s} = 0.294 \, \text{kg-m/s}
   \]

**Conclusion:**
The momentum of the object after 3 seconds is **0.294 kg-m/s**.

Lincoln has toy boxes where each toy represents a number in the binary number system. Lincoln has 11 more toy boxes for his siblings. How many toys do they have?

## Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the total number of toys in the toy boxes.
   - The toys are represented by numbers in the binary number system.
   - Lincoln has toy boxes, and there are 11 additional boxes for his siblings.

2. **Assessing the Information Given**:
   - The problem doesn't explicitly state how many toys are in each box or how many toys Lincoln has.
   - Without specific numbers, one logical interpretation is to find the collective total of the boxes, possibly each containing a binary representative toy.

3. **Interpreting the ""Binary"" Aspect**:
   - If each toy represents a number in binary, this likely implies that each toy is equivalent to a whole number, as binary numbers can represent any integer.
   - Without knowing specific numbers of toys in each box, focus on the total number of boxes.

4. **Determining the Total Number of Toy Boxes**:
   - Assume Lincoln has a certain number of toy boxes which are collectively represented with 11 additional boxes for his siblings.
   - Therefore, let the number of Lincoln’s toy boxes be \( L \). Then, the total number of toy boxes is \( L + 11 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the absence of the explicit number of toys per box, we focus on understanding that the total number of toy boxes is the primary question asked, assuming each box has an instance of binary representation toy.
   - If no further assumptions or hidden details exist, the answer is related directly to toy boxes' totality due to the binary emphasis, which becomes irrelevant numerically without per box detail.

Thus, we only articulate based on available box combination:

**Answer: L + 11** (where \( L \) is the number of Lincoln's original toy boxes). 

(Note: Given the problem's ambiguity in numbers due to the binary aspect, without further data, clarity might lean more particular specification or assumptions.)"

What is the percentage composition of the carbon element in sodium carbonate compound?

### Solution:
To determine the percentage composition of carbon in sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Molar Mass of Each Element in Na₂CO₃:**

   - Sodium (Na): The atomic mass of sodium is approximately 23 u (atomic mass units).
   - Carbon (C): The atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12 u.
   - Oxygen (O): The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16 u.

2. **Calculate the Molar Mass of Na₂CO₃:**

   Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) consists of two sodium atoms, one carbon atom, and three oxygen atoms. Its molar mass can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Molar mass of Na}_2\text{CO}_3 = (2 \times 23\, \text{u}) + (1 \times 12\, \text{u}) + (3 \times 16\, \text{u})
   \]

   \[
   = 46\, \text{u} + 12\, \text{u} + 48\, \text{u}
   \]

   \[
   = 106\, \text{u}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage Composition of Carbon:**

   The percentage composition of carbon is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of Carbon} = \left( \frac{\text{Atomic mass of Carbon}}{\text{Molar mass of Na}_2\text{CO}_3} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   Plugging in the values, we get:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of Carbon} = \left( \frac{12\, \text{u}}{106\, \text{u}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   \[
   \approx \left( 0.1132 \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   \[
   \approx 11.32\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage composition of carbon in sodium carbonate is approximately 11.32%.

   Given a right-angled triangle with base 12 and the height (or perpendicular side) 5, find the length of the hypotenuse.

2. **Detailed Step-by-step Solution:**

   In a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that for any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (\(a\) and \(b\)).

   The formula is as follows:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2
   \]

   Here, the base \(a\) is 12 and the height \(b\) is 5. We need to find the hypotenuse \(c\).

   Now, plug in the given values into the formula:
   \[
   c^2 = 12^2 + 5^2
   \]

   Calculate the squares of the numbers:
   \[
   c^2 = 144 + 25
   \]

   Perform the addition:
   \[
   c^2 = 169
   \]

   To find the length of the hypotenuse \(c\), we take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{169}
   \]

   Calculate the square root:
   \[
   c = 13

Russell said that he had 452 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 1000 (in octal) bananas to Karim. How many bananas will he have left in our number system?

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal:**

   Hexadecimal number: 452
   
   To convert from hexadecimal to decimal, we use the positional values of each digit, which are powers of 16.

   - '452' in hexadecimal means:
     - \(4 \times 16^2 + 5 \times 16^1 + 2 \times 16^0\)
     - \(= 4 \times 256 + 5 \times 16 + 2 \times 1\)
     - \(= 1024 + 80 + 2\)
     - \(= 1106\)

   Therefore, 452 (hex) = 1106 (decimal).

2. **Convert the octal number to decimal:**

   Octal number: 1000

   To convert from octal to decimal, we use the positional values of each digit, which are powers of 8.

   - '1000' in octal means:
     - \(1 \times 8^3 + 0 \times 8^2 + 0 \times 8^1 + 0 \times 8^0\)
     - \(= 1 \times 512 + 0 + 0 + 0\)
     - \(= 512\)

   Therefore, 1000 (oct) = 512 (decimal).

   Russell originally had 1106 bananas (in decimal).
   
   He gave away 512 bananas (in decimal).

   Remaining bananas = Original bananas - Given away bananas
   - \(= 1106 - 512\)

The speed of sound in air is \(350 \, \text{m/s}\). If the wavelength of a sound wave is \(35 \, \text{cm}\), what will be its frequency?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
To find the frequency of a sound wave, we can use the wave speed formula, which relates speed (\(v\)), frequency (\(f\)), and wavelength (\(\lambda\)). The formula is:
\[
v = f \times \lambda
\]

### Step 1: Convert Wavelength to Meters
The wavelength given is \(35 \, \text{cm}\). We need to convert this into meters for consistency with the speed units (which are in meters per second).

\[
35 \, \text{cm} = 0.35 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Use the Wave Speed Formula
We are given:
- Speed of sound, \(v = 350 \, \text{m/s}\)
- Wavelength, \(\lambda = 0.35 \, \text{m}\)

Plug these values into the wave speed formula to solve for frequency (\(f\)):

\[
350 \, \text{m/s} = f \times 0.35 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Frequency (\(f\))
Rearrange the formula to solve for \(f\):

\[
f = \frac{350 \, \text{m/s}}{0.35 \, \text{m}}
\]

Now, calculate the value:

\[
f = \frac{350}{0.35} = 1000 \, \text{Hz}

   ""What is the probability of getting a prime number when a fair six-sided die is rolled once?""

2. **Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

   When a six-sided die is rolled, the possible outcomes are the numbers 1 through 6. We need to determine which of these outcomes are prime numbers.

   - A prime number is any natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The prime numbers between 1 and 6 are 2, 3, and 5.

   Thus, the prime numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 3, and 5.

   Next, we will calculate the probability of rolling one of these prime numbers.

   Probability is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. 

   - The number of favorable outcomes (prime numbers) is 3 (which are 2, 3, and 5).
   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die is 6 (which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).

   Therefore, the probability \( P \) of rolling a prime number is given by the formula:

   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Possible Outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6}
   \]

   Simplifying \(\frac{3}{6}\), we get:

**English Translation:** If the temperature increase of a copper rod by 100 degrees Celsius results in its final length being 10.0167 meters, what was its original length?

### Step 2: Understand the Problem

We need to determine the original length of a copper rod, knowing that it expands to a certain length after a temperature increase. The problem involves thermal expansion, which can be calculated using the formula for linear expansion:

\[
L_f = L_i (1 + \alpha \Delta T)
\]

Where:
- \( L_f \) is the final length of the rod,
- \( L_i \) is the original length of the rod,
- \( \alpha \) is the coefficient of linear expansion for copper,
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

### Step 3: Gather Known Values

1. \( L_f = 10.0167 \) meters
2. \( \Delta T = 100 \) degrees Celsius
3. Coefficient of linear expansion for copper, \( \alpha \approx 16.5 \times 10^{-6} \) per degree Celsius

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation

Substitute the known values into the linear expansion formula:

\[
10.0167 = L_i (1 + 16.5 \times 10^{-6} \times 100)
\]

### Step 5: Simplify and Solve for \( L_i \)

Calculate the term \( (1 + \alpha \Delta T) \):

\[
1 + 16.5 \times 10^{-6} \times 100 = 1 + 0.00165 = 1.00165
\]

Now substitute this value back into the equation:

\[
10.0167 = L_i \times 1.00165
\]

To find \( L_i \), rearrange the equation:

\[
L_i = \frac{10.0167}{1.00165}
\]

Calculate \( L_i \):

\[
L_i \approx \frac{10.0167}{1.00165} \approx 10.0

Russell said that he originally had 77 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 10000 (in binary) to Karim. According to our numerical system, how many bananas did he originally have?

### Solution in English:

To solve this problem, we need to convert the given numbers into base 10 (decimal) to understand the quantities and perform the arithmetic.

#### Step 1: Convert 77 from hexadecimal to decimal.

Hexadecimal is base 16, where the digits range from 0 to 9 and A to F, with A = 10 and F = 15. The number 77 in hexadecimal is converted to decimal as follows:

- The rightmost digit is the units place (7 in hex), which is \(7 \times 16^0 = 7\).
- The next digit (from the right) is in the sixteens place (7 in hex), which is \(7 \times 16^1 = 112\).

Adding these values together, we get:
\[ 
112 + 7 = 119 
\]

Therefore, 77 in hexadecimal is 119 in decimal.

#### Step 2: Convert 10000 from binary to decimal.

Binary is base 2, and 10000 in binary is converted to decimal as follows:

- Starting from the right, the place values are \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3,\) and \(2^4\).
- The binary number 10000 has a '1' in the \(2^4\) position and '0's elsewhere.

This gives:
\[ 
1 \times 2^4 = 16 
\]

#### Conclusion:

Now that we have both numbers in decimal, we find that Russell originally had 119 bananas.

A stationary object with a mass of 2 kg, when dropped from above, covers a distance of 36 meters in 3 seconds. What is the frictional force acting on it in Newtons?

## Step-by-step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the frictional force or drag force acting on the object as it falls. We'll employ the following steps:

### 1. Identify the known variables:

- Mass, \(m = 2 \, \text{kg}\)
- Distance covered, \(s = 36 \, \text{m}\)
- Time taken, \(t = 3 \, \text{s}\)
- Acceleration due to gravity, \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)

### 2. Find the object's theoretical velocity and the acceleration.

A freely falling body under gravity (without any other force such as air resistance) would theoretically have an acceleration \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\). 

We can use the kinematic equation to determine the final velocity and acceleration:
\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2, \]
where \(s\) is the distance, \(u\) is the initial velocity, \(a\) is the acceleration, and \(t\) is the time. Since the object is initially at rest, \(u = 0\).

Plugging in the values we have:
\[ 36 = 0 \times 3 + \frac{1}{2}a \times (3)^2 \]
\[ 36 = \frac{1}{2}a \times 9 \]
\[ 36 = \frac{9}{2}a \]
\[ a = \frac{36 \times 2}{9} \]
\[ a = 8 \, \text{m/s}^2. \]

So, the actual acceleration, \(a = 8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

### 3. Determine the net force on the object and solve for the frictional force.

From Newton's second law, the net force \((F_{\text{net}})\) acting on an object is given by:
\[ F_{\text{net}} = m \times a \]

Thus,
\[ F_{\text{net}} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \, \text{"

   ""When one die and two coins are tossed together, how many possible outcomes are there?""

2. **Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:**

   To find the total number of possible outcomes, we need to consider both the outcomes from the die and the coins separately first, and then combine them.

   - **Die Outcomes:**
     A standard die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. So, when tossed, it can land on any one of these 6 faces.

   - **Coin Outcomes:**
     Each coin has 2 possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).
     Since there are two coins, we have to consider the combined outcomes of both coins:
     - Coin 1 can be Heads and Coin 2 can be Heads: (H, H)
     - Coin 1 can be Heads and Coin 2 can be Tails: (H, T)
     - Coin 1 can be Tails and Coin 2 can be Heads: (T, H)
     - Coin 1 can be Tails and Coin 2 can be Tails: (T, T)

     Thus, there are a total of \(2 \times 2 = 4\) outcomes for the two coins.

   - **Combined Outcomes:**
     To find the total number of combined outcomes when both the die and the two coins are tossed simultaneously, we multiply the number of possibilities for the die by the number of possibilities for the coins.
     \[
     \text{Total Outcomes} = \text{Outcomes from Die} \times \text{Outcomes from Coins} = 6 \times 4 = 24

A rectangular cuboid has a length of 12 cm, a width of 9 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the total surface area of this cuboid in square centimeters?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the total surface area of the rectangular cuboid, we use the formula for the surface area of a cuboid:

\[ \text{Surface Area} = 2(lw + lh + wh) \]

where:
- \( l \) is the length,
- \( w \) is the width, and
- \( h \) is the height.

Given:
- \( l = 12 \) cm,
- \( w = 9 \) cm,
- \( h = 6 \) cm.

Let's calculate each term separately:

1. **Calculate \( lw \):**
   \[
   lw = 12 \times 9 = 108 \text{ square cm}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( lh \):**
   \[
   lh = 12 \times 6 = 72 \text{ square cm}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( wh \):**
   \[
   wh = 9 \times 6 = 54 \text{ square cm}
   \]

Now, substitute these values back into the surface area formula:

\[ 
\text{Surface Area} = 2(108 + 72 + 54)
\]

Combine the values inside the parentheses:

\[
108 + 72 + 54 = 234
\]

Now, multiply by 2 to find the total surface area:

\[
\text{Surface Area} = 2 \times 234 = 468 \text{ square cm}
\]

In a bag, there are 12 blue balls, 16 white balls, and 20 black balls. What is the probability of not picking a white ball when one ball is drawn at random?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Balls:**
   - Blue balls = 12
   - White balls = 16
   - Black balls = 20

   Total number of balls = Blue balls + White balls + Black balls  
   \[
   = 12 + 16 + 20 = 48
   \]

2. **Calculate the Probability of Picking a White Ball:**
   - The event of picking a white ball has 16 favorable outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability of drawing a white ball is:
   \[
   P(\text{White ball}) = \frac{\text{Number of White balls}}{\text{Total number of balls}} = \frac{16}{48}
   \]
   Simplifying \(\frac{16}{48}\),
   \[
   P(\text{White ball}) = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Probability of Not Picking a White Ball:**
   - The event of not picking a white ball means picking either a blue or a black ball.
   - The complementary probability (not picking a white ball) is:
   \[
   P(\text{Not White ball}) = 1 - P(\text{White ball}) = 1 - \frac{1}{3}

""What amount of calcium bicarbonate is present in a 2-liter 0.2 molar calcium bicarbonate solution?""

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the amount of calcium bicarbonate in the solution, we need to consider the molarity concept:
- **Molarity (M)** is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

Given:
- Volume of the calcium bicarbonate solution = 2 liters
- Molarity of the solution = 0.2 M

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Moles of Calcium Bicarbonate

The formula for calculating moles (n) from molarity (M) and volume (V) is:

\[
n = M \times V
\]

Where:
- \( M = 0.2 \, \text{molar} \)
- \( V = 2 \, \text{liters} \)

Plug in the values:

\[
n = 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} \times 2 \, \text{L} = 0.4 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Mass of Calcium Bicarbonate

The molar mass of calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO₃)₂) is required for this step. Calculate as follows:
- Atomic mass of Calcium (Ca) = 40.08 g/mol
- Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1.01 g/mol
- Atomic mass of Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol
- Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol

Molar mass of Ca(HCO₃)₂ = 
\[ 
40.08 \, \text{(Ca)} + 2 \times 1.01 \, \text{(H)} + 2 \times 12.01 \, \text{(C)} + 6 \times 16.00 \, \text{(O)} 
\]

\[
= 40.08 + 2.02 + 24.02 + 96.00 
\]

\[
= 162.12 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Using the number of moles calculated, the mass (m) can be calculated using:

\[
m = \, \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar mass}

""What is the molecular mass of 5 moles of glucose?""

## Step 2: Understand the Problem

To find the molecular mass of 5 moles of glucose, we first need to determine the molecular mass of one mole of glucose. Then, we multiply that by 5 to obtain the total mass for 5 moles.

## Step 3: Determine the Molecular Mass of Glucose

The chemical formula for glucose is \( C_6H_{12}O_6 \).

To calculate the molecular mass, we need the atomic masses of the individual elements:
- Carbon (C): approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu)
- Hydrogen (H): approximately 1 amu
- Oxygen (O): approximately 16 amu

Using the formula \( C_6H_{12}O_6 \), the molecular mass is calculated as follows:
- Carbon: \( 6 \times 12 = 72 \) amu
- Hydrogen: \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) amu
- Oxygen: \( 6 \times 16 = 96 \) amu

Therefore, the molecular mass of glucose is:
\[ 72 + 12 + 96 = 180 \text{ amu} \]

## Step 4: Calculate the Mass of 5 Moles of Glucose

The molecular mass of one mole of glucose is 180 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of 5 moles is:
\[ 5 \times 180 = 900 \text{ grams} \]

From 56 grams of magnesium, how many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced?

### Solution:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the chemical reaction involved and the stoichiometry of that reaction:

1. **Chemical Reaction**:
   - When magnesium (Mg) reacts with oxygen (O₂) from the air, it forms magnesium oxide (MgO).
   - The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:
     \[
     2 \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO}
     \]

2. **Molar Masses**:
   - The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.31 g/mol.
   - The molar mass of magnesium oxide (MgO) is approximately 40.31 g/mol.

3. **Stoichiometry**:
   - According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO.
   - This means 1 mole of Mg will produce 1 mole of MgO.

4. **Calculating Moles of Magnesium**:
   - Given mass of Mg = 56 grams
   
   The number of moles of magnesium is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Moles of Mg} = \frac{\text{Given mass of Mg}}{\text{Molar mass of Mg}} = \frac{56 \, \text{g}}{24.31 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2.30 \, \text{moles}
   \]

   - Carbon dioxide (CO₂) consists of one carbon (C) atom and two oxygen (O) atoms.
   - The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.
   - The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.
   - Therefore, the molar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g/mol (for C) + 2 × 16.00 g/mol (for O) = 44.01 g/mol.

2. **Determine the Number of Moles**:
   - We have 88 grams of CO₂.
   - To find the number of moles, divide the mass by the molar mass:

A stone is dropped from a tower that is 2000 meters high. How long will it take to hit the ground (with acceleration due to gravity \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \))?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a stone being dropped from a height of 2000 meters.
   - The acceleration due to gravity is given as \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
   - We need to determine the time it takes for the stone to reach the ground.

2. **Using the Kinematic Equation:**
   - When an object is dropped (not thrown), its initial velocity \( u = 0 \).
   - We can use the second equation of motion for uniformly accelerated linear motion:
     \[
     s = ut + \frac{1}{2}gt^2
     \]
   where:
   - \( s \) is the distance fallen (2000 meters),
   - \( u \) is the initial velocity,
   - \( t \) is the time in seconds,
   - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Given: \( u = 0 \), \( s = 2000 \, \text{m} \), \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
   - Substituting these values into the equation:
     \[
     2000 = 0 \times t + \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times t^2
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     2000 = 5t^2
     \]

4. **Solve for \( t \):**
   - Divide both sides by 5 to isolate \( t^2 \):
     \[
     t^2 = \frac{2000}{5}
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     t^2 = 400
     \]
   - Take the square root of both sides to find \( t \):
     \[
     t = \sqrt{400} = 20

## Detailed Solution:

To determine the diameter of the wire using the readings from both the linear and circular scales, we need to add the two readings together. This total will give us the diameter measurement in millimeters.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understand the Measurements:**
   - **Linear Scale Reading:** This is a direct measurement of the diameter, and it measures 4 mm.
   - **Circular Scale Reading:** This is an additional precision measurement, providing a finer reading than the linear scale alone. This adds an additional 0.17 mm to the measurement.

2. **Add the Measurements:**
   - To find the total diameter, we simply add the readings from the linear and circular scales:
   \[
   \text{Total Diameter} = \text{Linear Scale Reading} + \text{Circular Scale Reading}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Diameter} = 4 \text{ mm} + 0.17 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - When we add 4 mm and 0.17 mm, we get:
   \[
   4 \text{ mm} + 0.17 \text{ mm} = 4.17 \text{ mm}

If 25 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved in 100 mL of solution, what is the molarity of the solution?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Concept of Molarity:**
   - Molarity is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution. It is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

2. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) = 25 grams
   - Volume of the solution = 100 mL = 0.1 L (since 1 liter = 1000 mL)

3. **Calculate the Moles of Sulfuric Acid:**
   - To find the moles, we first need the molar mass of sulfuric acid.
   - The chemical formula for sulfuric acid is H₂SO₄.
   - Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = (2 × Atomic mass of Hydrogen) + (1 × Atomic mass of Sulfur) + (4 × Atomic mass of Oxygen) 
   - Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 g/mol, Sulfur (S) = 32 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.
   - Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = (2 × 1) + (1 × 32) + (4 × 16) = 2 + 32 + 64 = 98 g/mol.

   Now, calculate the moles of H₂SO₄:
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = \frac{\text{Mass of H₂SO₄}}{\text{Molar mass of H₂SO₄}} = \frac{25 \text{ grams}}{98 \text{ g/mol}}

What is the complementary angle of a 110-degree angle when expressed in radians?

### Solution:

1. **Understanding Complementary Angles:**
   Complementary angles are two angles whose sum is exactly 90 degrees. If we have an angle of 110 degrees, we first need to find its complementary angle.

2. **Calculating the Complementary Angle:**
   - Given angle = 110 degrees.
   - Complementary angle = 90 degrees - 110 degrees.

   Performing the calculation:
   \[
   90^\circ - 110^\circ = -20^\circ
   \]

   As you can see, the problem states finding a complementary angle; however, a 110-degree angle cannot have a complementary angle in the traditional sense, because it exceeds 90 degrees. Thus, strictly speaking, its complementary angle would be negative, indicating a conceptual misunderstanding because complementary angles cannot be negative.

3. **Convert the Angle to Radians:**
   To express the angle in radians regardless of the complementary misunderstanding:

   Conversion factor from degrees to radians is \(\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}\).

   \[
   110^\circ = 110 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{11\pi}{18} \, \text{radians}
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   Even though an angle greater than 90 degrees cannot have a complementary angle, the task seems to ask for expression in radians of the angle already given.

In conclusion, **the complementary angle doesn't exist in a traditional sense for 110 degrees, but converting 110 degrees to radians gives:**

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Find the Volume of the Sphere:**
   
   The volume \( V \) of a sphere with radius \( r \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]

   Plugging in the radius \( r = 3 \) cm, we get:
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36 \pi \text{ cubic cm}
   \]

2. **Volume of the Cylinder:**

   When the sphere is melted and reformed as a cylinder, the volume stays the same. Thus, the volume of the cylinder is also \( 36\pi \) cubic cm.

3. **Find the Radius of the Cylinder:**

   The volume \( V \) of a cylinder with radius \( r \) and height \( h \) is given by:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]

   We know that \( V = 36 \pi \) and \( h = 36 \) cm. Substituting these values, we have:
   \[
   36 \pi = \pi r^2 \times 36
   \]

   Dividing both sides by \( 36\pi \):
   \[
   r^2 = 1 \Rightarrow r = 1 \text{ cm}
   \]

4. **Curved Surface Area of the Cylinder:**

   The curved surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   A = 2 \pi r h
   \]

   Substituting \( r = 1 \) cm and \( h = 36 \) cm, we get:
   \[
   A = 2 \pi \times 1 \times 36 = 72 \pi \text{ square cm}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Numerical Curved Surface Area:**

   Using the approximate value for \(\pi \approx 3.1416\), the curved surface area becomes:

   This translates to: ""What is the complementary angle of 70.50 degrees?""

2. **Step-by-Step Solution:**
   - Complementary angles are two angles whose sum is 90 degrees.
   - Given one of the angles is 70.50 degrees, we need to find the other angle that, when added to 70.50 degrees, equals 90 degrees.

   **Steps:**
   - Let the complementary angle be \( x \).
   - According to the definition of complementary angles, we have:
     \[
     70.50 + x = 90
     \]
   - To find \( x \), subtract 70.50 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 90 - 70.50
     \]
   - Perform the subtraction:
     \[
     x = 19.50
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   The complementary angle of 70.50 degrees is 19.50 degrees.

What is the probability of getting a perfect square number when randomly selecting from the first 100 natural numbers?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Range:**
   - We're considering the first 100 natural numbers, which range from 1 to 100.

2. **Identify Perfect Squares:**
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.
   - To find perfect squares up to 100, we identify numbers that, when squared, result in values ≤ 100:
     - \( 1^2 = 1 \)
     - \( 2^2 = 4 \)
     - \( 3^2 = 9 \)
     - \( 4^2 = 16 \)
     - \( 5^2 = 25 \)
     - \( 6^2 = 36 \)
     - \( 7^2 = 49 \)
     - \( 8^2 = 64 \)
     - \( 9^2 = 81 \)
     - \( 10^2 = 100 \)
   - Thus, the perfect squares between 1 and 100 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.

3. **Count the Perfect Squares:**
   - There are 10 perfect squares within the first 100 natural numbers.

4. **Calculate the Probability:**
   - Probability is given by the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Number of successful outcomes: 10 (the perfect squares).
   - Total number of possible outcomes: 100 (the natural numbers from 1 to 100).

   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of perfect squares}}{\text{Total numbers}} = \frac{10}{100} = \frac{1}{10}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a perfect square from the first 100 natural numbers is \(\frac{1}{10}\).

If an object is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 19.6 m/s, how high will the object go at maximum?

## Step-by-step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum height reached by an object thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity. The fundamental physics principle here is the conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy, while the force of gravity acts downwards.

1. **Initial Information and Assumptions:**
   - Initial velocity (\(u\)) = 19.6 m/s
   - Final velocity (\(v\)) at maximum height = 0 m/s (The object momentarily stops at the peak before falling back down)
   - Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) = 9.8 m/s\(^2\) (downwards, hence negative when going upwards)

2. **Equation of Motion:**
   We will use the following kinematic equation that relates initial and final velocities, acceleration, and distance:
   \[
   v^2 = u^2 + 2as
   \]
   Here, \(v = 0\) m/s, \(u = 19.6\) m/s, \(a = -9.8\) m/s\(^2\), and \(s\) is the maximum height.

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   \[
   0 = (19.6)^2 + 2(-9.8)s
   \]

4. **Solve for \(s\):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(s\):
   \[
   0 = 384.16 - 19.6s
   \]
   \[
   19.6s = 384.16
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{384.16}{19.6}
   \]

5. **Calculate Numerical Solution:**
   \[
   s = 19.6 \, \text{meters}

Thus, the object will reach a maximum height of 19.6 meters.

   - A rectangular prism has a length of 3 cm, a diagonal of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the width of the prism in centimeters?

2. **Step-by-step solution:**
   - Let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular prism as follows:
     - Length (\( l \)) = 3 cm
     - Height (\( h \)) = 3 cm
     - Width (\( w \)) = ?
     - Diagonal (\( d \)) = 5 cm
     
   - In a rectangular prism, the formula for the space diagonal (\( d \)) in terms of its dimensions is given by:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
     \]
     
   - Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:
     \[
     5 = \sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 3^2}
     \]
     
   - Simplifying inside the square root:
     \[
     5 = \sqrt{9 + w^2 + 9}
     \]
     \[
     5 = \sqrt{18 + w^2}
     \]
     
   - Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     25 = 18 + w^2

   - Solving for \( w^2 \):
     \[
     w^2 = 25 - 18

   - ""What is the molecular mass of 11 moles of carbonic acid?""

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:**

   To find the molecular mass of 11 moles of carbonic acid, we first need to determine the molecular mass of one mole of carbonic acid. Carbonic acid has the chemical formula H₂CO₃.

   **Calculating the Molecular Mass of Carbonic Acid (H₂CO₃):**

   - The atomic masses of the elements involved are approximately:
     - Hydrogen (H): 1 g/mol
     - Carbon (C): 12 g/mol
     - Oxygen (O): 16 g/mol

   - Using the formula H₂CO₃, calculate the molecular mass by summing the masses of all the atoms:
     - Hydrogen: 2 atoms × 1 g/mol = 2 g/mol
     - Carbon: 1 atom × 12 g/mol = 12 g/mol
     - Oxygen: 3 atoms × 16 g/mol = 48 g/mol

   - Add these values together to get the molecular mass of carbonic acid:
     - Molecular mass of H₂CO₃ = 2 g/mol + 12 g/mol + 48 g/mol = 62 g/mol

   **Calculating the Mass of 11 Moles of Carbonic Acid:**

   - Once the molecular mass of one mole of carbonic acid is known (62 g/mol), we can find the mass of 11 moles by multiplying by 11:
     - Mass of 11 moles = 11 moles × 62 g/mol = 682 g

A number is randomly selected from the natural numbers between 10 and 21. What is the probability that the number is prime?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

### List the Natural Numbers:
First, we list the natural numbers from 10 to 21 inclusive:
\[ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 \]

### Identify the Prime Numbers:
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's identify which of these numbers are prime:
- **10**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 5)
- **11**: Prime
- **12**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6)
- **13**: Prime
- **14**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 7)
- **15**: Not prime (divisible by 3, 5)
- **16**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 8)
- **17**: Prime
- **18**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 6, 9)
- **19**: Prime
- **20**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 5, 10)
- **21**: Not prime (divisible by 3, 7)

The prime numbers in this range are: \( 11, 13, 17, 19 \).

### Count the Total Numbers and Prime Numbers:
- Total numbers from 10 to 21: \( 21 - 10 + 1 = 12 \)
- Prime numbers identified: \( 11, 13, 17, 19 \) (Total: 4)

### Calculate the Probability:
The probability \( P \) that a randomly selected number is prime is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of Prime Numbers}}{\text{Total Numbers}} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Thus, the probability that a randomly selected number between 10 and 21 is prime is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

From the natural numbers between 1 and 200, if a number is chosen at random, what is the probability that the number is a perfect cube?

## Solution
To find the probability that a randomly chosen number between 1 and 200 is a perfect cube, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Range of Perfect Cubes**:  
   The first step is to determine which numbers are perfect cubes between 1 and 200. A number \( n \) is a perfect cube if \( n = k^3 \) for some integer \( k \).

2. **Determine the Limits for \( k \)**:  
   - The smallest perfect cube is \( 1^3 = 1 \).
   - We need to find the largest integer \( k \) such that \( k^3 \leq 200 \).

3. **Calculating for Values of \( k \)**:  
   - \( k = 1 \), then \( k^3 = 1 \).
   - \( k = 2 \), then \( k^3 = 8 \).
   - \( k = 3 \), then \( k^3 = 27 \).
   - \( k = 4 \), then \( k^3 = 64 \).
   - \( k = 5 \), then \( k^3 = 125 \).
   - \( k = 6 \), then \( k^3 = 216 \) which is larger than 200.

   Thus, the integers \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4, \) and \( 5 \) generate the perfect cubes within our range.

4. **Listing the Perfect Cubes**:  
   The numbers \( 1, 8, 27, 64, \) and \( 125 \) are the perfect cubes less than or equal to 200.

5. **Count the Perfect Cubes**:  
   There are 5 perfect cubes between 1 and 200.

6. **Calculate the Probability**:  
   Probability is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Total numbers between 1 and 200 are 200.
   - The number of favorable outcomes (perfect cubes) is 5.

   Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen number is a perfect cube is:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

where \( c \) is the hypotenuse and \( a \) and \( b \) are the other two sides of the right triangle, which are called the base and the height.

## Solution in English

To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by mass of carbon in a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂).

### Step-by-step Solution

1. **Determine the Molar Mass**:
   - Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is composed of one carbon (C) atom and two oxygen (O) atoms.
   - The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 amu (atomic mass units).
   - The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 amu.
   
   Molar mass of CO₂ = mass of 1 C + mass of 2 O = 12.01 + 2 * 16.00 = 44.01 amu.

2. **Calculate the Mass Contribution of Carbon**:
   - The mass of the carbon in CO₂ is 12.01 amu (from the carbon atom).

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Carbon**:
   - Percentage of carbon in CO₂ = (mass of carbon / molar mass of CO₂) * 100
   - Percentage of carbon = (12.01 / 44.01) * 100

4. **Compute the Value**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of carbon} = \left(\frac{12.01}{44.01}\right) \times 100 \approx 27.29\%

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we need to define what is meant by the ""percentage concentration"" and apply this definition appropriately to a hypothetical problem involving copper sulfate (CuSO₄) and water. 

   The percentage concentration of a solution typically refers to the mass percentage, which is the mass of the solute divided by the total mass of the solution, multiplied by 100.

   Let's consider a hypothetical example with actual numbers to illustrate this process:

   - Assume we have a solution containing 20 grams of copper sulfate (CuSO₄) dissolved in 80 grams of water.

   - The mass of the solute, copper sulfate: 20 grams.

   - The mass of the solvent, water: 80 grams.

   - The total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of the solute and the solvent:
     \[
     \text{Total mass of solution} = \text{mass of solute} + \text{mass of solvent} = 20\, \text{g} + 80\, \text{g} = 100\, \text{g}
     \]

   - The formula to calculate the percentage concentration is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage concentration} = \left( \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{total mass of solution}} \right) \times 100
     \]

   - Substituting the values in:
     \[
     \text{Percentage concentration} = \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
     \]

   Therefore, in this hypothetical example, the percentage concentration of copper sulfate in the solution is 20%.

   **Note:** If specific values of the masses were given in the original problem, those would be used to calculate the actual concentration. Since the original problem did not specify data, a hypothetical scenario was used for illustrative purposes.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the final speed of the car after applying a certain deceleration over a given period.

1. **Identify the initial conditions**:
   - Initial speed (\(u\)) = 10 m/s
   - Deceleration (\(a\)) = 2 m/s²

The reading on the main scale is 12 mm, the Vernier scale alignment is 7, and the Vernier constant is 0.10 mm. What is the reading in cm?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Understanding the Components**

- **Main Scale Reading (MSR):** This is the reading directly from the main scale. According to the problem, the main scale reading (MSR) is 12 mm.

- **Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):** This is calculated by multiplying the Vernier scale alignment (or the coinciding number) with the Vernier constant. From the problem, the Vernier alignment is 7 and the Vernier constant is 0.10 mm.

**Step 2: Calculating the Vernier Scale Reading**

\[ \text{VSR} = \text{Vernier Alignment} \times \text{Vernier Constant} \]

\[ \text{VSR} = 7 \times 0.10 \, \text{mm} \]

\[ \text{VSR} = 0.70 \, \text{mm} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Reading**

The total reading on the Vernier scale (TR) is the sum of the main scale reading and the Vernier scale reading.

\[ \text{Total Reading} = \text{MSR} + \text{VSR} \]

\[ \text{Total Reading} = 12 \, \text{mm} + 0.70 \, \text{mm} \]

\[ \text{Total Reading} = 12.70 \, \text{mm} \]

**Step 4: Convert the Total Reading from mm to cm**

Since we need to provide the final answer in centimeters, we convert the total reading from millimeters to centimeters knowing that 1 cm equals 10 mm.

\[ \text{Total Reading in cm} = \frac{12.70 \, \text{mm}}{10} \]

\[ \text{Total Reading in cm} = 1.27 \, \text{cm} \]

A solid metallic sphere with a diameter of 5 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. What is the height of the resulting cylinder in centimeters?

## Solution:

To solve the problem, we need to conserve the volume because the material from the sphere is completely converted into the cylinder. Therefore, the volume of the sphere will be equal to the volume of the cylinder.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere
The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Given, the diameter of the sphere is 5 cm, hence the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
\[
r = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ cm}
\]

Substitute the radius into the formula:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (2.5)^3
\]
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (15.625)
\]
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{62.5}{3} \pi
\]
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} \approx 65.45 \text{ cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]

Given, the radius of the cylinder is 3 cm. We need to find the height \( h \).

Using the volume conservation principle, set \( V_{\text{sphere}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} \):
\[
\frac{62.5}{3} \pi = \pi (3)^2 h
\]
\[
\frac{62.5}{3} = 9h
\]
\[
h = \frac{62.5}{3 \times 9}
\]
\[
h = \frac{62.5}{27}
\]
\[
h \approx 2.31 \text{ cm}
\]

Therefore, the height of the resulting cylinder is approximately 2.31 cm.

What is the number of atoms in one molecule of ferric carbonate?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we first need to identify the chemical formula for ferric carbonate. Ferric carbonate is the carbonate of iron (III), and its chemical formula is Fe₂(CO₃)₃.

### Breakdown of the Chemical Formula:
1. **Fe₂(CO₃)₃** indicates that there is a compound consisting of iron (Fe), carbon (C), and oxygen (O).
2. The subscript numbers represent the number of each type of atom in one molecule of this compound:
   - **Fe₂** means there are 2 iron atoms.
   - **(CO₃)₃** needs to be analyzed further:
     - **CO₃** is the carbonate ion and consists of 1 carbon atom and 3 oxygen atoms.
     - **(CO₃)₃** implies there are 3 carbonate ions present. 

### Calculate Total Number of Atoms:

A metallic solid sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

## Solution
To solve this problem, we need to first understand that the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder since the sphere is melted and recast into the cylinder. We will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere
The diameter of the sphere is given as 6 cm, which means the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
\[ r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \, \text{cm} \]

The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

Substitute the value of \( r \):
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 \]
\[ = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 \]
\[ = 36 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

### Step 2: Relate Sphere Volume to Cylinder Volume
Since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, their volumes are equal:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = V_{\text{sphere}} = 36 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi R^2 H \]
where \( R \) is the radius of the cylinder's base, and \( H \) is the height.

We know the height \( H = 4 \) cm, so plug in the known values:
\[ 36 \pi = \pi R^2 \times 4 \]

Divide both sides by \( \pi \) to simplify:
\[ 36 = 4R^2 \]

Solve for \( R^2 \):
\[ R^2 = \frac{36}{4} \]
\[ R^2 = 9 \]

Taking the square root gives:
\[ R = 3 \, \text{cm} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Surface Area of the Cylinder
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:

When 0.25 moles of magnesium nitrate are heated, what is the volume of nitrogen dioxide produced?

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Chemical Reaction:**
   - The decomposition of magnesium nitrate (\( \text{Mg(NO}_3)_2 \)) upon heating can be represented by the chemical equation:
     \[
     2 \text{Mg(NO}_3)_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO} + 4 \text{NO}_2 + \text{O}_2
     \]
   - This equation shows that 2 moles of magnesium nitrate produce 4 moles of nitrogen dioxide (\( \text{NO}_2 \)).

2. **Determine Moles of \( \text{NO}_2 \) Produced:**
   - Since the ratio of \(\text{Mg(NO}_3)_2\) to \(\text{NO}_2\) from the balanced equation is 2:4, i.e., 1:2, it implies that 1 mole of magnesium nitrate produces 2 moles of nitrogen dioxide.
   - Therefore, 0.25 moles of magnesium nitrate will produce:
     \[
     0.25 \times 2 = 0.5 \text{ moles of } \text{NO}_2
     \]

3. **Calculate Volume of \( \text{NO}_2 \) at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP):**
   - At STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters.
   - Thus, the volume \( V \) of 0.5 moles of \( \text{NO}_2 \) is calculated as:

In the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, how many grams of oxygen are required to produce 9 grams of water?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we'll need to use the chemical equation for the formation of water and apply the concept of stoichiometry.

1. **Write the Balanced Chemical Equation:**

   The balanced chemical equation for the formation of water is:

   \[
   2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]

   This equation tells us that 2 molecules of hydrogen react with 1 molecule of oxygen to produce 2 molecules of water.

2. **Understand the Molar Masses:**

   - The molar mass of water (\(\text{H}_2\text{O}\)) is approximately \(2 \times 1 + 16 = 18\) grams/mol. 
   - The molar mass of oxygen (\(\text{O}_2\)) is approximately \(2 \times 16 = 32\) grams/mol.

3. **Determine Moles of Water Produced:**

   We are given that 9 grams of water is produced. Using the molar mass of water, we calculate the number of moles:

   \[
   \text{Moles of water} = \frac{9 \text{ grams}}{18 \text{ grams/mol}} = 0.5 \text{ moles}
   \]

4. **Use Stoichiometry to Find Moles of Oxygen Needed:**

   According to the chemical equation, 2 moles of water are produced from 1 mole of oxygen. Therefore, the ratio of moles of water to moles of oxygen is 2:1.

   \[
   \text{Moles of oxygen required} = \frac{0.5 \text{ moles of water}}{2} = 0.25 \text{ moles}
   \]

5. **Convert Moles of Oxygen to Grams:**

   Now, convert the moles of oxygen required to grams using the molar mass of oxygen:

   \[
   \text{Grams of oxygen needed} = 0.25 \text{ moles} \times 32 \text{ grams/mol} = 8 \text{ grams}
   \]

A bullet with a mass of 20 grams is fired at a speed of 500 m/s from a gun having a mass of 5 kg, taking 0.1 seconds to fire. What is the magnitude of the force exerted on the bullet by the gun?

### Solution:

To find the force exerted on the bullet, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force is equal to the change in momentum per unit time. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \]

where \( \Delta p \) is the change in momentum and \( \Delta t \) is the change in time.

#### Step 1: Calculate the initial momentum of the bullet.
The initial momentum (\( p_i \)) of the bullet is zero because it starts from rest.

#### Step 2: Calculate the final momentum of the bullet.
The final velocity (\( v \)) of the bullet is given as 500 m/s. The mass (\( m \)) of the bullet is 20 grams, which needs to be converted to kilograms:

\[ m = \frac{20 \text{ grams}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ kg} \]

The final momentum (\( p_f \)) of the bullet can be calculated as:

\[ p_f = m \times v = 0.02 \text{ kg} \times 500 \text{ m/s} = 10 \text{ kg m/s} \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the change in momentum (\( \Delta p \)).
The change in momentum is the final momentum minus the initial momentum:

\[ \Delta p = p_f - p_i = 10 \text{ kg m/s} - 0 = 10 \text{ kg m/s} \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the force exerted on the bullet.
Given that the time duration (\( \Delta t \)) over which this change occurs is 0.1 seconds, the force (\( F \)) is:

\[ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{10 \text{ kg m/s}}{0.1 \text{ s}} = 100 \text{ N} \]

The magnitude of the force exerted on the bullet by the gun is **100 Newtons**.

**Step-by-step solution with explanations:**

1. **Identify the events:**
   Let \( A \) be the event that Rafiq travels by bus from Khulna to Rajshahi. Then, the probability of event \( A \) is \( P(A) = \frac{4}{5} \).
   
   Let \( B \) be the event that Rafiq travels by train from Rajshahi to Rangpur. Then, the probability of event \( B \) is \( P(B) = \frac{6}{7} \).

2. **Identify the desired event:**

A single mass object is thrown upwards with a speed of 10 m/s. At what height from the ground will the kinetic energy and potential energy of the object be equal?

### Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE) in the context of an object in motion under gravity.

1. **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: The kinetic energy of an object with mass \( m \) and velocity \( v \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]

2. **Potential Energy (PE)**: The potential energy of an object at a height \( h \) from the ground is given by the formula:
   \[
   PE = mgh
   \]
   where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

3. **Condition for Equilibrium**: We need to find the height \( h \) at which the kinetic energy equals the potential energy:
   \[
   KE = PE
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = mgh
   \]
   The mass \( m \) cancels out from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} v^2 = gh
   \]
   
4. **Substitute the Given Values**: We are given the initial velocity \( v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Plug these values into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} (10)^2 = 9.8h
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 9.8h
   \]
   \[
   50 = 9.8h
   \]

5. **Solve for \( h \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{50}{9.8}
   \]
   \[
   h \approx 5.10 \, \text{m}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The object will have equal kinetic and potential energy at a height of approximately 5.10 meters above the ground.

The difference in the circumferences of two wheels is 90 cm. What is the difference in their radii in cm?

## Solution:

To find the difference in the radii of the two wheels, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is \( C = 2 \pi r \), where \( C \) is the circumference and \( r \) is the radius.

**Step 1:** Let the radii of the two wheels be \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), with \( r_1 > r_2 \). Therefore, their circumferences will be:
- \( C_1 = 2 \pi r_1 \)
- \( C_2 = 2 \pi r_2 \)

**Step 2:** According to the problem, the difference in their circumferences is 90 cm:
\[ 
C_1 - C_2 = 90 
\]
Substituting the expressions for the circumferences, we get:
\[ 
2 \pi r_1 - 2 \pi r_2 = 90 
\]

**Step 3:** Factor out \( 2 \pi \) from the left side:
\[ 
2 \pi (r_1 - r_2) = 90 
\]

**Step 4:** Solve for the difference in the radii \( r_1 - r_2 \):
\[ 
r_1 - r_2 = \frac{90}{2 \pi} 
\]

**Step 5:** Calculate the value using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[ 
r_1 - r_2 = \frac{90}{2 \times 3.14159} \approx \frac{90}{6.28318} \approx 14.32

   When a coin is tossed once, the probability of getting heads is 0.60. If the coin is tossed 300 times, how many times can tails appear?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   The problem involves understanding probability and calculating the expected outcomes based on this probability.

   **Step 1: Understand the Probability of Tails**

   - Since the probability of getting heads is 0.60, the probability of getting tails can be calculated as:
     
     \[
     P(\text{Tails}) = 1 - P(\text{Heads}) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40
     \]

   **Step 2: Calculate the Expected Number of Tails**

   - The expected number of tails in 300 tosses can be determined by multiplying the probability of getting tails by the total number of tosses. 

     \[
     \text{Expected number of Tails} = P(\text{Tails}) \times \text{Total number of tosses}
     \]

   - Substituting the known values:

     \[
     \text{Expected number of Tails} = 0.40 \times 300
     \]

   - Perform the multiplication:

     \[
     \text{Expected number of Tails} = 120

At what temperature does the reading on the Fahrenheit scale equal twice the reading on the Celsius scale?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we need to find the temperature at which the Fahrenheit temperature is twice the Celsius temperature.

1. **Set the Equation:**

   We know the relationship between Fahrenheit (F) and Celsius (C) temperature scales is given by:

   \[
   F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
   \]

   According to the problem, the Fahrenheit reading is twice the Celsius reading:

   \[
   F = 2C
   \]

2. **Substitute and Solve:**

   Substitute the expression for \( F \) from the first equation into the equation \( F = 2C \):

   \[
   \frac{9}{5}C + 32 = 2C
   \]

   To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 5:

   \[
   9C + 160 = 10C
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**

   Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \) on one side:

   \[
   160 = 10C - 9C
   \]

   \[
   160 = C
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Substitute \( C = 160 \) back into the equation \( F = 2C \) to find \( F \):

   \[
   F = 2 \times 160 = 320
   \]

   Now check with the conversion formula:

   \[
   F = \frac{9}{5} \times 160 + 32
   \]

   \[
   F = 288 + 32 = 320
   \]

   The calculated Fahrenheit temperature is indeed 320, which matches our solution in step 3.

Therefore, the temperature at which the Fahrenheit scale reading is twice the Celsius scale reading is 160 degrees Celsius.

In a lottery, 760 tickets have been sold. Raju has bought 20 tickets. The tickets are shuffled well and one ticket is drawn at random. What is the probability that Raju does not win the first prize?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the probability that Raju does not win the first prize, we need to consider how many tickets Raju did not purchase out of the total tickets, and then calculate the probability based on that.

### Step 1: Identify the total number of tickets.
- Total number of tickets sold: 760

### Step 2: Identify how many tickets Raju did not buy.
- Raju bought 20 tickets.
- Tickets not bought by Raju = Total tickets - Raju's tickets = 760 - 20 = 740 tickets

### Step 3: Calculate the probability.
The probability that a ticket Raju did not buy is drawn is the number of tickets not bought by Raju divided by the total number of tickets.

Probability (Raju does not win) = (Number of tickets not bought by Raju) / (Total number of tickets)  
\[ = \frac{740}{760} \]

### Step 4: Simplify the probability fraction.

The fraction \(\frac{740}{760}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD). 
- The GCD of 740 and 760 is 20.

What volume of ammonia can be obtained from 4 liters of nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure? All reactants and products are gases.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

Given the problem, we need to determine how much ammonia (NH₃) can be produced from nitrogen (N₂) under standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions. It is important to know the balanced chemical equation for the production of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, which is known as the Haber process:

\[ N_2 + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3 \]

### Understanding the Stoichiometry:

According to the balanced chemical equation:
- 1 mole of \( N_2 \) reacts with 3 moles of \( H_2 \) to produce 2 moles of \( NH_3 \).

### Applying the Gas Laws:

At STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters (since gases behave ideally under these conditions). The stoichiometry from the equation tells us about the mole ratio, but because all conditions (temperature and pressure) are the same and all substances are gases, the mole ratio is equivalent to the volume ratio for the gases involved.

### Calculate the volume of NH₃ produced:

Given:
- Volume of \( N_2 \) = 4 liters.
- According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 volume of \( N_2 \) gives 2 volumes of \( NH_3 \). This means 4 liters of \( N_2 \) should give:

\[
4 \text{ liters of } N_2 \times \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters of } NH_3}{1 \text{ liter of } N_2}\right) = 8 \text{ liters of } NH_3.
\]

Therefore, from 4 liters of nitrogen gas, we can produce 8 liters of ammonia gas under the same conditions of temperature and pressure.

To prepare 250 milliliters of a 0.1 molar sodium carbonate solution, how many grams of sodium carbonate are required?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many grams of sodium carbonate are needed to make a 0.1 molar (M) solution in 250 milliliters (mL) of water. We can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Definitions
- **Molarity (M)** is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.
- The given molarity is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles of sodium carbonate per liter of solution.

### Step 2: Determine Moles Required
The volume of the solution is 250 mL, which is 0.250 liters (since 1000 mL = 1 L). Using the definition of molarity:

\[
\text{Moles of sodium carbonate} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume in liters}
\]

\[
\text{Moles of sodium carbonate} = 0.1 \, \text{mol/L} \times 0.250 \, \text{L} = 0.025 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Convert Moles to Grams
Next, we need to convert the moles of sodium carbonate to grams. For this, we use the molar mass of sodium carbonate (Na\(_2\)CO\(_3\)). The atomic weights are approximately:
- Sodium (Na): 23 g/mol
- Carbon (C): 12 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16 g/mol

The formula for sodium carbonate (Na\(_2\)CO\(_3\)) consists of:
- 2 Sodium atoms: \(2 \times 23 = 46\) g/mol
- 1 Carbon atom: 12 g/mol
- 3 Oxygen atoms: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) g/mol

Sum of atomic weights for Na\(_2\)CO\(_3\):
\[
46 + 12 + 48 = 106 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Now, convert moles to grams:
\[
\text{Grams of sodium carbonate} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar mass}
\]

Translated to English: ""How many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced from 20 grams of magnesium?""

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction involved in the formation of magnesium oxide from magnesium.

### Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation

The chemical reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O₂) to form magnesium oxide (MgO) is as follows:

\[ 2 \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO} \]

This indicates that two moles of magnesium react with one mole of oxygen to produce two moles of magnesium oxide.

### Step 2: Calculate the molar masses

- The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.31 g/mol.
- The molar mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol; hence, O₂ is 32.00 g/mol.
- The molar mass of magnesium oxide (MgO) is 24.31 g/mol (Mg) + 16.00 g/mol (O) = 40.31 g/mol.

### Step 3: Determine the number of moles of magnesium

Using the mass of magnesium provided (20 grams), we can calculate the number of moles:

\[
\text{Moles of Mg} = \frac{\text{Mass of Mg}}{\text{Molar mass of Mg}} = \frac{20 \text{ g}}{24.31 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.823 \text{ mol}
\]

### Step 4: Use stoichiometry to find moles of magnesium oxide

According to the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO. Thus, 0.823 moles of magnesium will produce exactly 0.823 moles of magnesium oxide.

### Step 5: Calculate the mass of magnesium oxide

Finally, calculate the mass of the produced magnesium oxide using its molar mass:

\[
\text{Mass of MgO} = \text{Moles of MgO} \times \text{Molar mass of MgO} = 0.823 \text{ mol} \times 40.31"

   A solid metal sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 1 cm. What is the height of the resulting cylinder?

2. **Step-by-step Solution:**

   The problem involves two shapes: a sphere and a cylinder. The volume of metal remains constant before and after the transformation from sphere to cylinder. We need to equate the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder and find the height of the cylinder.

   **Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere**

   The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

   Here, the radius \( r = 3 \) cm. Substitute the value into the formula:
   \[
   V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36 \pi \text{ cm}^3
   \]

   **Step 2: Write the Volume Formula for the Cylinder**

   The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

   Here, the radius \( r = 1 \) cm. We are to find the height \( h \), so we keep this as a variable:
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (1)^2 \cdot h = \pi h
   \]

   **Step 3: Set the Volumes Equal and Solve for Height**

   Since the volume of the material remains the same:
   \[
   36 \pi = \pi h
   \]

   Cancel \(\pi\) from both sides:
   \[
   36 = h
   \]

   Thus, the height of the cylinder is 36 cm.

3. **Concluding the Solution:**

   The height of the resulting cylinder formed by melting the sphere is \(36\) cm.

A 3 kg mass object is moving eastward with a velocity of 2 m/s. Another object with a mass of 1 kg is moving westward with a velocity of 2 m/s. At some point, the two objects collide and merge into one. What is the velocity of the combined object?

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use the principle of conservation of momentum. According to this principle, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

1. **Define the System:**
   - Object 1 (moving eastward):
     - Mass, \(m_1 = 3 \, \text{kg}\)
     - Velocity, \(v_1 = 2 \, \text{m/s}\)
   - Object 2 (moving westward):
     - Mass, \(m_2 = 1 \, \text{kg}\)
     - Velocity, \(v_2 = -2 \, \text{m/s}\) (Note: The velocity is negative because it is moving in the opposite direction to object 1.)

2. **Calculate Initial Momentum:**
   - Momentum of object 1:
     \[
     p_1 = m_1 \times v_1 = 3 \times 2 = 6 \, \text{kg m/s}
     \]
   - Momentum of object 2:
     \[
     p_2 = m_2 \times v_2 = 1 \times (-2) = -2 \, \text{kg m/s}
     \]

3. **Total Initial Momentum:**
   \[
   p_{\text{total initial}} = p_1 + p_2 = 6 + (-2) = 4 \, \text{kg m/s}
   \]

4. **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**
   - Let \(v\) be the velocity of the combined object after the collision.
   - Total mass after collision: \(m_{\text{total}} = m_1 + m_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 \, \text{kg}\)
   - According to conservation of momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{total initial}} = p_{\text{total final}}
     \]
   - Therefore:

A driver moving at a speed of 54 km/h sees a pedestrian 46 meters away and immediately applies the brakes. As a result, the car stops 1 meter ahead of the pedestrian. What was the car's acceleration?

### Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**

   - The initial speed (\( v_i \)) of the car is 54 km/h.
   - Distance to the pedestrian is 46 meters.
   - Car stops 1 meter past the pedestrian, so the stopping distance is 45 meters (since it stops 1 meter ahead of the pedestrian).
   - Final speed (\( v_f \)) of the car when it stops is 0 km/h.

2. **Conversion of Speed:**
   
   - Convert the speed from km/h to m/s:
     \[
     54 \text{ km/h} = \frac{54 \times 1000 \text{ m}}{3600 \text{ s}} = 15 \text{ m/s}
     \]

3. **Using the Equation of Motion:**

   - We use the third equation of motion:
     \[
     v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2as
     \]
     where:
     - \( v_f \) = final velocity = 0 m/s,
     - \( v_i \) = initial velocity = 15 m/s,
     - \( a \) = acceleration (which we need to find),
     - \( s \) = stopping distance = 45 meters.

4. **Substitute the Known Values and Solve:**

   - Substitute into the equation:
     \[
     0 = (15)^2 + 2 \times a \times 45
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     0 = 225 + 90a

     \[
     90a = -225
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{-225}{90} = -2.5 \text{ m/s}^2

   The acceleration of the car when the driver applied the brakes is \(-2.5 \text{ m/s}^2\). The negative sign indicates that the car is decelerating.

""If the wavelength of a sound wave produced from a radio speaker vibrating at 300 Hz frequency is 1.15 meters in air, what is the speed of the sound wave in air?""

### Step-by-Step Solution

To find the speed of the sound wave in air, we can use the fundamental wave equation:

\[ v = f \times \lambda \]

where:
- \( v \) is the speed of the wave,
- \( f \) is the frequency of the wave,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the wave.

From the problem, we are given:
- Frequency (\( f \)) = 300 Hz
- Wavelength (\( \lambda \)) = 1.15 meters

Now, plug in these values into the wave equation to solve for the speed \( v \):

\[ v = 300 \text{ Hz} \times 1.15 \text{ m} \]

\[ v = 345 \text{ m/s} \]

Thus, the speed of the sound wave in air is **345 meters per second**.

The problem in English: What is the molecular mass of 12 moles of methane?

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding Moles and Molecular Mass**:
   - A mole is a unit that measures the amount of substance. It is defined as containing exactly 6.022 x 10²³ entities (such as atoms or molecules).
   - The molecular mass (or molecular weight) is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule.

2. **Identifying the Chemical Composition of Methane**:
   - Methane (CH₄) is composed of one carbon (C) atom and four hydrogen (H) atoms.
   - To find the molecular mass, we need the atomic masses of these elements:
     - The atomic mass of Carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.
     - The atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.01 g/mol.

3. **Calculating the Molecular Mass of Methane (CH₄)**:
   - Molecular mass of CH₄ = 1(C) + 4(H)
   - = 1 x 12.01 g/mol + 4 x 1.01 g/mol
   - = 12.01 g/mol + 4.04 g/mol
   - = 16.05 g/mol

4. **Calculating the Mass of 12 Moles of Methane**:
   - If 1 mole of methane has a mass of 16.05 g, then the mass of 12 moles is calculated by multiplying the molecular mass by the number of moles.
   - Mass of 12 moles of methane = Molecular mass of CH₄ x Number of moles
   - = 16.05 g/mol x 12 moles
   - = 192.6 grams

Thus, the mass of 12 moles of methane is 192.6 grams.

A solid metal sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Find the Volume of the Sphere**:  
   The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:

   \[
   V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]

   Where \( r = 6 \) cm is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the value, we get:

   \[
   V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 = 288 \pi \, \text{cubic cm}
   \]

2. **Volume of the Cylinder**:  
   When the sphere is melted and formed into a cylinder, the volume of the sphere becomes equal to the volume of the cylinder. Let \( r_{\text{cylinder}} \) be the radius of the cylinder and the height of the cylinder \( h = 32 \) cm. The volume of the cylinder is:

   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r_{\text{cylinder}}^2 h
   \]

   Setting \( V_{\text{sphere}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} \), we have:

   \[
   288 \pi = \pi r_{\text{cylinder}}^2 \times 32
   \]

   Dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

   \[
   288 = r_{\text{cylinder}}^2 \times 32
   \]

   Solving for \( r_{\text{cylinder}}^2 \):

   \[
   r_{\text{cylinder}}^2 = \frac{288}{32} = 9

   Therefore, the radius of the cylinder is:

   \[
   r_{\text{cylinder}} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \, \text{cm}
   \]

""What is the probability of getting a multiple of 3 when a fair die is rolled once?""

## Solution
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the total possible outcomes when a fair die is rolled and then determine the favorable outcomes (multiples of 3 in this case).

### Step 1: Identify the Total Number of Outcomes
A standard six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. Thus, when you roll a die, there are 6 possible outcomes, represented by the numbers 1 through 6.

### Step 2: Identify the Favorable Outcomes
To find the favorable outcomes, we need to identify which numbers from 1 to 6 are multiples of 3. 

- A multiple of 3 is a number that can be divided by 3 without any remainder.
- Checking each number:
  - 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333... (not a multiple)
  - 2 ÷ 3 = 0.666... (not a multiple)
  - 3 ÷ 3 = 1 (multiple)
  - 4 ÷ 3 = 1.333... (not a multiple)
  - 5 ÷ 3 = 1.666... (not a multiple)
  - 6 ÷ 3 = 2 (multiple)

The numbers 3 and 6 are the only numbers between 1 and 6 that are multiples of 3. Therefore, the favorable outcomes are 3 and 6.

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
- Probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
- The number of favorable outcomes = 2 (the numbers 3 and 6).
- The total number of possible outcomes = 6 (the numbers 1 through 6).

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Possible Outcomes}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

The probability of rolling a multiple of 3 on a die is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

An object starts its journey from rest and reaches a speed of 20 m/s after 5 seconds. What is the distance covered by the object in the next 10 seconds?

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we must first understand that there are two distinct intervals of motion described in the problem: 

1. **The first interval (0 to 5 seconds):**
   - The object accelerates from rest to a speed of 20 m/s over 5 seconds.
   
2. **The second interval (5 to 15 seconds):**
   - The object continues to move for an additional 10 seconds, and we need to calculate the distance it covers during this time.

Let's approach the problem step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Determine the acceleration during the first interval
- The object starts from rest, which means its initial speed \( v_0 = 0 \) m/s.
- It reaches a speed \( v = 20 \) m/s after 5 seconds.
- Using the formula for acceleration, \( a \), given by \( v = v_0 + at \), we have:
  \[
  20 = 0 + a \times 5
  \]
  Solving for \( a \), we get:
  \[
  a = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2
  \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the speed at the end of the first interval
- After 5 seconds, as given, the speed reached is 20 m/s.

#### Step 3: Calculate the distance covered during the second interval
- For the second interval (from 5 to 15 seconds), the object moves with a constant speed of 20 m/s (as it achieves this speed at the end of the first interval and continues with this constant speed without further acceleration).
- The formula for distance \( d \) when speed is constant is given by:
  \[
  d = v \times t
  \]
- Here, \( v = 20 \) m/s and \( t = 10 \) seconds (from 5 to 15 seconds):
  \[
  d = 20 \times 10 = 200 \, \text{meters}
  \]

Thus, the distance covered by the object during the next 10 seconds is 200 meters.

### 2. Detailed Solution with Explanations
To solve this problem, we need to understand what is being asked:

- We are given 9 moles of sulfur dioxide (\( SO_2 \)).
- We are asked to find the molecular weight total for these 9 moles.

**Step 1: Determine the molecular weight of sulfur dioxide (\( SO_2 \))**

Sulfur dioxide is a compound composed of:
- One sulfur (S) atom
- Two oxygen (O) atoms

The atomic weights of these elements are approximately:
- Sulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Thus, the molecular weight of \( SO_2 \) can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Molecular weight of } SO_2 = \text{(Weight of sulfur)} + 2 \times \text{(Weight of oxygen)} \]
\[ = 32.07\, \text{g/mol} + 2 \times 16.00\, \text{g/mol} \]
\[ = 32.07\, \text{g/mol} + 32.00\, \text{g/mol} \]
\[ = 64.07\, \text{g/mol} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight of 9 moles of sulfur dioxide**

Now that we have the molecular weight of one mole of \( SO_2 \), we can find the total molecular weight for 9 moles:
\[ \text{Weight of 9 moles of } SO_2 = 9 \times \text{Molecular weight of } SO_2 \]
\[ = 9 \times 64.07\, \text{g/mol} \]
\[ = 576.63\, \text{g} \]

24 grams of magnesium is burned in sufficient air. How many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced?

### Step-by-step solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the chemical reaction involved:

\[ \text{2Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{2MgO} \]

1. **Determine the Molar Masses:**
   - Magnesium (Mg) has an atomic mass of approximately 24 grams per mole.
   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 grams per mole.
   - Therefore, the molar mass of oxygen gas (\( \text{O}_2 \)) = \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) grams per mole.
   - Magnesium oxide (MgO) has a molar mass of \( 24 + 16 = 40 \) grams per mole.

2. **Balanced Equation:**
   The balanced equation for the reaction shows that 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of magnesium oxide.

3. **Calculation:**
   - From the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg (2 \times 24 = 48 grams) produce 2 moles of MgO (2 \times 40 = 80 grams).
   - Therefore, 24 grams of Mg will produce:
   
     \[
     \left(\frac{80}{48}\right) \times 24 = \frac{80 \times 24}{48} = 40 \text{ grams of MgO}
     \]

### Conclusion:

The complete combustion of 24 grams of magnesium in sufficient air will produce 40 grams of magnesium oxide.

A boy with a mass of 40 kg climbs a staircase to the roof in 15 seconds. The staircase has 20 steps and each step is 16 cm high. What is the power of the boy in watts?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the total height climbed.**
- Each step is 16 cm high.
- There are 20 steps.

The total height climbed is:
\[ \text{Total Height} = 20 \times 16 \text{ cm} = 320 \text{ cm} \]

Convert this height into meters (since 1 m = 100 cm):
\[ \text{Total Height} = \frac{320}{100} \text{ m} = 3.2 \text{ m} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the work done against gravity.**

The work done by the boy is equal to the gravitational potential energy gained:
\[ \text{Work Done (W)} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Gravity} \times \text{Height} \]

Assuming \( g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
\[ \text{Work Done} = 40 \text{ kg} \times 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 \times 3.2 \text{ m} \]

Calculate this:
\[ \text{Work Done} = 40 \times 9.8 \times 3.2 \]
\[ \text{Work Done} = 40 \times 31.36 \]
\[ \text{Work Done} = 1254.4 \text{ Joules} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the power used (in Watts).**

Power is defined as work done per unit time:
\[ \text{Power (P)} = \frac{\text{Work Done}}{\text{Time}} \]

The time taken is 15 seconds:
\[ \text{Power} = \frac{1254.4 \text{ J}}{15 \text{ s}} \]

Calculate this:
\[ \text{Power} = 83.6267 \text{ Watts} \]

Therefore, rounding to two decimal places:
\[ \text{Power} = 83.63 \text{ Watts} \]

What is the volume of 17 grams of ammonia gas at standard conditions?

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Question**:
   We need to find out the volume that 17 grams of ammonia (NH₃) gas would occupy under standard conditions. Standard conditions typically refer to Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), which is 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm pressure.

2. **Molecular Weight of Ammonia**:
   The molecular formula for ammonia is NH₃. To determine its molar mass, we sum up the atomic masses of nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H).
   - Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol 
   - Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol per atom, and there are 3 hydrogen atoms.
   
   Thus, molecular weight of NH₃ is:
   \[
   14.01 + 3 \times 1.01 = 14.01 + 3.03 = 17.04 \text{ g/mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate Moles of Ammonia**:
   Given mass of ammonia is 17 grams. Using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Moles of NH₃} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{17 \text{ g}}{17.04 \text{ g/mol}} 
   \]
   \[
   \approx 0.99765 \text{ mol}
   \]

4. **Volume at STP**:
   At STP, one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 liters. Thus, the volume occupied by 0.99765 moles of ammonia is:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{moles} \times \text{volume per mole at STP} = 0.99765 \times 22.414
   \]
   \[
   \approx 22.362 \text{ liters}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the volume of 17 grams of ammonia gas at standard conditions is approximately:

A 1 kg mass object is thrown vertically upwards. It falls to the ground after 10 seconds. What will be the potential energy of the object at its maximum height in joules?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum height reached by the object because potential energy at the maximum height is what we're looking for. Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the motion

An object thrown vertically upwards will have two phases of motion:
- It moves upwards until it comes to a stop at the maximum height.
- Then it moves downwards back to the ground.

Given that the total time for the upward and downward motion is 10 seconds, we can deduce that the time to reach the maximum height is 5 seconds (since the time to go up equals the time to come down).

### Step 2: Calculate the initial velocity

To find the initial velocity, use the first part of the motion, where the object goes up and comes to a stop:
- We'll use the equation of motion: \( v = u + at \)
  - At the maximum height, final velocity \( v = 0 \).
  - \( a \) is the acceleration due to gravity, which is \(-9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) (negative because it opposes the motion).
  - \( t = 5 \) seconds (time to reach maximum height).
  
Using the equation:
\[ 0 = u + (-9.8)(5) \]

Solving for \( u \):
\[ 0 = u - 49 \]
\[ u = 49 \, \text{m/s} \]

Hence, the initial velocity \( u \) is 49 m/s.

### Step 3: Calculate the maximum height

Now, use the formula for displacement to find the maximum height (\( h \)) reached:
\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \]

At maximum height:
\[ 0 = (49)^2 + 2(-9.8)h \]

\[ 0 = 2401 - 19.6h \]

Now solve for \( h \):
\[ 19.6h = 2401 \]

\[ h = \frac{2401}{19.6} \]

\[ h = 122.5 \, \text{meters} \]

A coin is tossed 2000 times, resulting in 1030 heads. What is the probability of getting a tail when the coin is tossed once?

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Determine the Total Number of Tosses:**
   
   The problem states that the coin was tossed 2000 times.

2. **Determine the Number of Heads:**

   Out of these 2000 tosses, heads appeared 1030 times.

3. **Calculate the Number of Tails:**

   Since every toss results in either a head or a tail, we can find the number of tails by subtracting the number of heads from the total number of tosses:

   \[
   \text{Number of tails} = 2000 - 1030 = 970
   \]

4. **Calculate the Probability of Getting a Tail:**

   The probability \(P(\text{Tail})\) is given by the ratio of the number of outcomes resulting in a tail to the total number of tosses. Therefore:

   \[
   P(\text{Tail}) = \frac{\text{Number of tails}}{\text{Total number of tosses}} = \frac{970}{2000}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Probability:**

   Simplify the fraction \(\frac{970}{2000}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD):

   The GCD of 970 and 2000 is 10.

   \[
   \frac{970 \div 10}{2000 \div 10} = \frac{97}{200}

A solid metallic sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

## Detailed Solution:

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We have a solid sphere that is melted and made into a cylinder.
   - The diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, which means its radius is half of the diameter: 
     \[
     r_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cm}
     \]

2. **Calculate the volume of the sphere:**
   - The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
     \[
     V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
     \]
   - Substituting the radius of the sphere:
     \[
     V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36\pi \text{ cubic cm}
     \]

3. **Use this volume to form a cylinder:**
   - The volume of a cylinder is given by:
     \[
     V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
     \]
   - The radius of the cylinder is given as 3 cm:
     \[
     r_{\text{cylinder}} = 3 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - Since the volume of the sphere and cylinder must be equal:
     \[
     \pi (3)^2 h = 36\pi
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for the height \( h \):
     \[
     9h = 36 \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{36}{9} = 4 \text{ cm}
     \]

4. **Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder:**
   - The formula for the curved surface area of a cylinder is:
     \[
     A_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi r h
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     A_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi \times 3 \times 4 = 24\pi \text{ square cm}

To produce 56 grams of calcium oxide, how many grams of oxygen are required?

## 2. Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use the chemical reaction for the formation of calcium oxide from calcium and oxygen. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

\[ \text{2 Ca} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{2 CaO} \]

### Step 1: Molar Mass Calculation
First, let's calculate the molar masses of the involved compounds:

- **Calcium (Ca):** The atomic mass of calcium is approximately 40 g/mol.
- **Oxygen (O):** The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16 g/mol, thus for O\(_2\), the molar mass is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) g/mol.
- **Calcium Oxide (CaO):** The molar mass of calcium oxide is the sum of the atomic masses of calcium and oxygen: \(40 + 16 = 56\) g/mol.

### Step 2: Using Stoichiometry of the Reaction
According to the balanced equation:

- 2 moles of Ca react with 1 mole of O\(_2\) to produce 2 moles of CaO.
- Hence, 1 mole of CaO requires 0.5 mole of O\(_2\).

### Step 3: Grams of Oxygen for Given Grams of Calcium Oxide
Given that we need to produce 56 grams of CaO:

- Determine the number of moles of CaO in 56 grams:
  \[
  \text{Moles of CaO} = \frac{56 \text{ grams of CaO}}{56 \text{ g/mol}} = 1 \text{ mole}
  \]

- Since 1 mole of CaO requires 0.5 mole of O\(_2\), compute the mass of 0.5 moles of O\(_2\):
  \[
  \text{Mass of O}_2 = 0.5 \times 32 \text{ g/mol} = 16 \text{ grams}
  \]

## Conclusion:
Therefore, to produce 56 grams of calcium oxide, 16 grams of oxygen are required.

   Russell said he had 77 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave Karim 10000 (in binary) bananas. According to our number system, how many bananas does he have left?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:**

   To solve this problem, we need to perform a subtraction, but first we must convert the numbers into a common base—decimal.

   - **Step 1: Convert 77 (Hexadecimal) to Decimal.**

     The number \(77_{16}\) is in hexadecimal format. In hexadecimal, each digit can range from 0 to 15, and it is base 16. To convert this to decimal, proceed as follows:
     
     \(77_{16} = 7 \times 16^1 + 7 \times 16^0\)

     \[
     = 7 \times 16 + 7 \times 1 = 112 + 7 = 119
     \]

     So, 77 in hexadecimal is 119 in decimal.

   - **Step 2: Convert 10000 (Binary) to Decimal.**

     The number \(10000_2\) is in binary format. In binary, each digit is a power of 2. To convert this to decimal, proceed as follows:
     
     \(10000_2 = 1 \times 2^4 + 0 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0\)

     \[
     = 1 \times 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 16
     \]

     So, 10000 in binary is 16 in decimal.

   - **Step 3: Subtract the Decimal Values.**

     Now, subtract the number of bananas given away from the total number of bananas initially:

     \[
     119 \, (\text{total bananas}) - 16 \, (\text{bananas given to Karim}) = 103
     \]

   After converting both numbers from their respective bases to decimal and performing the subtraction, Russell is left with 103 bananas.

""What is the volume of 10 grams of helium gas under standard conditions?""

## Solution:

To find the volume of 10 grams of helium gas at standard conditions, we will use the Ideal Gas Law and the properties of helium:

1. **Molar mass of helium:** Helium (He) has an atomic number of 2, and its approximate atomic mass is 4 grams/mole.

2. **Number of moles of helium:** We start by calculating the number of moles of helium in 10 grams. The formula for the number of moles (\( n \)) is:
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{10 \text{ g}}{4 \text{ g/mol}} = 2.5 \text{ moles}
   \]

3. **Using the Ideal Gas Law:** The Ideal Gas Law is given by:
   \[
   PV = nRT
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the pressure (in atm),
   - \( V \) is the volume (in liters),
   - \( n \) is the number of moles,
   - \( R \) is the universal gas constant (\( R = 0.0821 \text{ L atm/mol K} \)),
   - \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

   At standard temperature and pressure (STP), the conditions are:
   - \( P = 1 \) atm
   - \( T = 273.15 \) K

4. **Calculating the volume at STP:** 
   Substitute the known values into the Ideal Gas Law to solve for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{2.5 \text{ moles} \times 0.0821 \text{ L atm/mol K} \times 273.15 \text{ K}}{1 \text{ atm}}
   \]
   \[
   V = \frac{2.5 \times 0.0821 \times 273.15}{1} 
   \approx 56.145 \text{ L}
   \]

Thus, the volume of 10 grams of helium gas at standard temperature and pressure is approximately **56.145 liters**.

   - Calculate \( 2 \times 8^1 = 2 \times 8 = 16 \).
   - Calculate \( 5 \times 8^0 = 5 \times 1 = 5 \).
   - Add them together: \( 16 + 5 = 21 \).

   Therefore, 25 (octal) is 21 in decimal.

2. **Convert 15 (octal) to decimal:**

   Octal 15 means \( 1 \times 8^1 + 5 \times 8^0 \).

   - Calculate \( 1 \times 8^1 = 1 \times 8 = 8 \).
   - Calculate \( 5 \times 8^0 = 5 \times 1 = 5 \).

How many oxygen atoms are there in an alum molecule?

### Solution in English:

To solve this problem, we need to understand what a typical alum molecule is composed of. Generally, alum is a type of double sulfate salt that includes elements like potassium or sodium, an aluminum or another trivalent metal, and crystallized water. The most common type of alum is Potassium Alum, with the chemical formula \(\text{KAl(SO}_4\text{)}_2 \cdot 12\text{H}_2\text{O}\).

Let's break down the components of Potassium Alum to determine how many oxygen atoms are present:

1. **Sulfate Ions**: 
   - Each sulfate ion, \(\text{SO}_4^{2-}\), contains 4 oxygen atoms.
   - In the formula \(\text{KAl(SO}_4\text{)}_2\), there are 2 sulfate ions.
   - Total oxygen atoms from sulfate ions = \(2 \times 4 = 8\) oxygen atoms.

2. **Crystallized Water**:
   - Each water molecule, \(\text{H}_2\text{O}\), contains 1 oxygen atom.
   - There are 12 water molecules in the formula.
   - Total oxygen atoms from water = \(12 \times 1 = 12\) oxygen atoms.

3. **Adding All the Oxygen Atoms**:
   - Oxygen atoms from sulfate ions = 8
   - Oxygen atoms from water = 12
   - Total oxygen atoms in one alum molecule = \(8 + 12 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of oxygen atoms in one molecule of Potassium Alum is 20.

5 grams of coke and 5 grams of oxygen react to produce carbon dioxide. How many grams of coke will remain after the reaction?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we need to understand the chemical reaction between coke, which is primarily made up of carbon (C), and oxygen (O₂) to produce carbon dioxide (CO₂). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

\[ \text{C} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 \]

### Step 1: Molar Mass Calculation

- **Molar Mass of Carbon (C):** 12 g/mol
- **Molar Mass of Oxygen (O₂):** 32 g/mol (since it's O₂, with 16 g/mol for each oxygen atom)
- **Molar Mass of Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** 44 g/mol (12 g/mol for C + 32 g/mol for O₂)

### Step 2: Reaction Stoichiometry

From the equation \( \text{C} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 \), one mole of carbon reacts with one mole of oxygen to produce one mole of carbon dioxide.

### Step 3: Determine the Limiting Reactant

Given:
- 5 grams of coke (assumed to be pure carbon)
- 5 grams of oxygen

#### Calculate Moles
- Moles of Carbon:
  \[
  \frac{5 \, \text{grams of C}}{12 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.4167 \, \text{moles of C}
  \]
- Moles of Oxygen:
  \[
  \frac{5 \, \text{grams of O}_2}{32 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.15625 \, \text{moles of O}_2
  \]

The reaction requires 1 mole of O₂ for each mole of C. We have fewer moles of O₂ than C, so oxygen is the limiting reactant.

### Step 4: Calculate the Amount of Coke Used

Since oxygen is the limiting reactant, all 0.15625 moles of O₂ will be consumed in the reaction.

From the balanced equation, 0.15625 moles of O₂ will react with exactly 0.15625 moles of C.

The problem asks: 54 kilometers per hour is equivalent to how many meters per second?

## Solution
To convert from kilometers per hour to meters per second, we use the following conversion factors:
- 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters
- 1 hour = 3,600 seconds (since 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds, thus \(60 \times 60 = 3,600\) seconds)

The formula to convert kilometers per hour to meters per second is:
\[ 
\text{meters per second} = \left(\frac{\text{kilometers per hour} \times 1,000}{3,600}\right) 
\]

Given that the speed is 54 kilometers per hour, we substitute this into our formula:
\[
\text{meters per second} = \left(\frac{54 \times 1,000}{3,600}\right)
\]

Now, calculate the expression:
1. Multiply 54 by 1,000:
\[
54 \times 1,000 = 54,000
\]

2. Divide 54,000 by 3,600:
\[
\frac{54,000}{3,600} = 15

To produce 4 grams of magnesium oxide, 2 grams of magnesium are mixed with 2 grams of oxygen gas in a suitable environment. However, the expected amount of product was not obtained. How many grams of oxygen reacted in the process?

## Solution
1. **Understand the Chemical Reaction:**
   The chemical reaction for forming magnesium oxide \((MgO)\) is:
   \[
   2 \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO}
   \]
   This reaction indicates that 2 moles of magnesium (\(\text{Mg}\)) react with 1 mole of oxygen gas (\(\text{O}_2\)) to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide (\(\text{MgO}\)).

2. **Molar Mass Calculation:**
   - Molar mass of magnesium \((\text{Mg})\): 24 g/mol
   - Molar mass of oxygen gas \((\text{O}_2)\): 32 g/mol
   - Molar mass of magnesium oxide \((\text{MgO})\): 40 g/mol

3. **Determine Moles of Reactants:**
   - Moles of magnesium: \[\frac{2 \text{ grams}}{24 \text{ g/mol}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ mol}\]
   - Moles of oxygen gas: \[\frac{2 \text{ grams}}{32 \text{ g/mol}} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ mol}\]

A gun with a mass of 1 kg fires a bullet with a mass of 5 grams. When the gun is fired, it receives a recoil velocity of 2 m/s. What is the final velocity of the bullet in m/s?

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the law of conservation of momentum:**
   - In a closed system, where no external forces are acting, the total momentum before an event must equal the total momentum after the event.

2. **Identify the masses and velocities:**
   - Mass of the gun, \( M_{\text{gun}} = 1 \, \text{kg} \).
   - Mass of the bullet, \( m_{\text{bullet}} = 5 \, \text{grams} = 0.005 \, \text{kg} \) (since 1 kg = 1000 grams).
   - Recoil velocity of the gun, \( V_{\text{gun}} = 2 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Let's denote the final velocity of the bullet as \( v_{\text{bullet}} \).

3. **Apply conservation of momentum:**
   - Before the gun is fired, the system is at rest; hence the total initial momentum is 0.
   - After firing, the total momentum of the system (gun + bullet) must also be 0, because the system's initial momentum was 0.

   Therefore, 
   \[
   M_{\text{gun}} \times (-V_{\text{gun}}) + m_{\text{bullet}} \times v_{\text{bullet}} = 0
   \]

   Substituting the known values,
   \[
   1 \times (-2) + 0.005 \times v_{\text{bullet}} = 0 
   \]

4. **Solve for the bullet's final velocity:**
   \[
   -2 + 0.005 \times v_{\text{bullet}} = 0
   \]

   \[
   0.005 \times v_{\text{bullet}} = 2 
   \]

   \[
   v_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{2}{0.005}

   \[

At a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, a 150-gram water sample has a 75 degrees Celsius iron rod immersed in it, with the final temperature reaching 56 degrees Celsius. The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/kg/K, and the specific heat capacity and density of iron are 450 J/kg/K and 7800 kg/m³, respectively. How much heat in joules is absorbed by the water?

## Step-by-Step Solution

To solve the problem, we will calculate the amount of heat absorbed by the water. We will use the formula for heat transfer, which is given by:  
\[ Q = mc\Delta T \]  
where:
- \( Q \) is the heat absorbed or released,
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity,
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

### Step 1: Convert Mass from grams to kilograms
The mass of the water \( m \) is given as 150 grams. To use the heat transfer formula, this mass should be in kilograms.
\[ m = 150 \text{ grams} = 0.150 \text{ kg} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Change in Temperature for Water
The initial temperature of the water is 30°C, and the final temperature is 56°C. The change in temperature, \( \Delta T \), is:
\[ \Delta T = T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial}} = 56^\circ \text{C} - 30^\circ \text{C} = 26^\circ \text{C} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Heat Absorbed by Water
Now, we use the specific heat capacity of water \( c = 4200 \text{ J/kg/K} \) to find the heat absorbed (\( Q \)).
\[ Q = (0.150 \text{ kg}) \times (4200 \text{ J/kg/K}) \times (26 \text{ K}) \]
\[ Q = 0.150 \times 4200 \times 26 \]
\[ Q = 16380 \]

The heat absorbed by the water is 16,380 joules.

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to find out the mass of 0.1 moles of sulfuric acid (\(H_2SO_4\)) in grams. The molecular weight of sulfuric acid is necessary for this calculation.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Molecular Formula:**
   Sulfuric acid has the chemical formula \(H_2SO_4\).

2. **Determine the Molar Mass:**
   To find the molar mass of \(H_2SO_4\), sum up the atomic masses of all atoms in the formula.
   - Hydrogen (\(H\)): 2 atoms × 1 g/mol = 2 g/mol
   - Sulfur (\(S\)): 1 atom × 32 g/mol = 32 g/mol
   - Oxygen (\(O\)): 4 atoms × 16 g/mol = 64 g/mol

   Therefore, the molar mass of sulfuric acid (\(H_2SO_4\)) is:
   \[
   2 + 32 + 64 = 98 \, \text{g/mol}

A spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half-submerged and floating in water. What is the buoyancy of the sphere?

## Solution
To find the buoyancy of the sphere, we need to understand that when an object floats in a fluid, the buoyant force acting on it is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the object. 

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Submerged Part:**
   Since the sphere is half-submerged, the volume of the submerged part is half of the total volume of the sphere.
   \[
   \text{Volume of submerged part} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total volume of sphere}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume of submerged part} = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \, \text{cubic meters} = 100 \, \text{cubic meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Buoyancy:**
   The buoyancy (or buoyant force) is equal to the weight of the displaced water. This can be calculated using the density of water, which is approximately \(1000 \, \text{kg/cubic meter}\), and the gravitational acceleration \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
   \[
   \text{Buoyancy} = \text{Density of water} \times \text{Volume of submerged part} \times g

   \[
   \text{Buoyancy} = 1000 \, \text{kg/cubic meter} \times 100 \, \text{cubic meters} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2

   \]

2. **Identify the provided values and convert units:**
   - Volume of solution = 200 ml = 0.200 liters (since \(1 \text{ liter} = 1000 \text{ ml}\))
   - Desired concentration (molarity), \(M = 0.5 \text{ M}\) (semi-molar)

3. **Determine the number of moles needed:**

   According to the principle of force multiplication, in a hydraulic press, if the diameter of the larger piston is 8 times that of the smaller piston, how many times the force will be experienced on the larger piston?

2. **Step-by-step Solution:**

   Let's denote:
   - \( D_s \) as the diameter of the smaller piston.
   - \( D_l \) as the diameter of the larger piston, which is given as \( 8 \times D_s \). Hence, \( D_l = 8D_s \).

   **Principle of Hydraulic Press:**
   
   The hydraulic press operates on Pascal's principle, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions throughout the fluid. Mathematically, the pressure on the smaller piston \( P_s \) is equal to the pressure on the larger piston \( P_l \).

   Since pressure \( P \) is defined as force \( F \) per unit area \( A \), i.e., \( P = \frac{F}{A} \), and remains constant in the hydraulic system:

   \[
   \frac{F_s}{A_s} = \frac{F_l}{A_l}
   \]

   Here:
   - \( A_s = \frac{\pi (D_s/2)^2}{\pi} = \frac{\pi D_s^2}{4} \) is the area of the smaller piston.
   - \( A_l = \frac{\pi (D_l/2)^2}{\pi} = \frac{\pi (8D_s)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \cdot 64 \cdot D_s^2}{4} = 16 \pi \cdot \frac{D_s^2}{4} = 16 \cdot A_s \) is the area of the larger piston.

   Now, the relation becomes:

   \[
   \frac{F_s}{A_s} = \frac{F_l}{A_l} \Rightarrow F_l = F_s \times \frac{A_l}{A_s}
   \]

   Substituting the areas:

   \[
   F_l = F_s \times \frac{16A_s}{A_s} = F_s \times 16
   \]

   Therefore, the force experienced on the larger piston is 16 times the force applied on the smaller piston.

Among a group of students, 60 like cricket, 40 like football, and 25 like both games. How many students like at least one game?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students who like at least one of the games: cricket or football. This involves the principle of set union in mathematics.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the set of students who like cricket.
- \( F \) as the set of students who like football.

Given:
- \( |C| = 60 \) (The number of students who like cricket)
- \( |F| = 40 \) (The number of students who like football)
- \( |C \cap F| = 25 \) (The number of students who like both cricket and football)

We need to find \( |C \cup F| \), the number of students who like at least one of the two games (cricket or football).

According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets:
\[ |C \cup F| = |C| + |F| - |C \cap F| \]

Substitute the given values into this formula:
\[ |C \cup F| = 60 + 40 - 25 \]

\[ |C \cup F| = 100 - 25 \]

\[ |C \cup F| = 75 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like at least one game is 75.

The sum of two angles is 60 degrees and their difference is 30 degrees. What is the measure of the smaller angle?

## Solution
Let's denote the two angles as \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \) is the smaller angle and \( y \) is the larger angle.

### Step 1: Establish Equations
According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information to form equations:

1. The sum of the two angles is 60 degrees:
   \[
   x + y = 60
   \]

2. The difference between the two angles is 30 degrees:
   \[
   y - x = 30
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations
We have a system of two equations:

1. \( x + y = 60 \)
2. \( y - x = 30 \)

To solve for \( x \) and \( y \), we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, I'll use the elimination method:

- Add the two equations:

\[
(x + y) + (y - x) = 60 + 30
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
x + y + y - x = 90
\]

This reduces to:

\[
2y = 90
\]

Solving for \( y \), we get:

\[
y = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now substitute the value of \( y = 45 \) back into the equation for the sum of the angles:

\[
x + 45 = 60
\]

Solving for \( x \), we get:

\[
x = 60 - 45 = 15
\]

Thus, the measure of the smaller angle is \( 15 \) degrees.

### Conclusion
The measure of the smaller angle is 15 degrees.

The question asks, ""By what factor is the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of oxygen molecules greater than the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of water molecules?""

### Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the composition of both oxygen molecules (O₂) and water molecules (H₂O).

1. **Number of Oxygen Atoms in One Mole of Oxygen Molecules (O₂):**
   - A molecule of oxygen (O₂) consists of two oxygen atoms.
   - One mole of any substance contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules (Avogadro's number).
   - Therefore, one mole of O₂ contains \(2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 1.2044 \times 10^{24}\) oxygen atoms.

2. **Number of Oxygen Atoms in One Mole of Water Molecules (H₂O):**
   - A molecule of water (H₂O) consists of one oxygen atom.
   - Similarly, one mole of H₂O contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules.
   - Thus, one mole of H₂O contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) oxygen atoms.

3. **Calculating the Factor:**
   - To find by what factor the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of oxygen molecules is greater than in one mole of water molecules, we take the ratio of the two quantities:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\text{Number of oxygen atoms in 1 mole of O₂}}{\text{Number of oxygen atoms in 1 mole of H₂O}} = \frac{1.2044 \times 10^{24}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}
   \]
   - This simplifies to \(2\).

Thus, one mole of oxygen molecules contains twice as many oxygen atoms as one mole of water molecules.

A solid metallic sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder that is 4 cm tall. What is the radius of the resulting cylinder?

## Solution

To find the radius of the resulting cylinder, we need to apply the principle of conservation of volume, meaning the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder formed.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere

The formula for the volume of a sphere is:

\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Given that the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, the radius \( r_{\text{sphere}} \) is half of the diameter:

\[
r_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cm}
\]

Substitute the radius into the volume formula:

\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 27 = 36 \pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:

\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]

Where \( h \) is the height of the cylinder, and \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder's base. Given \( h = 4 \text{ cm} \).

Since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, the volumes are equal:

\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = V_{\text{cylinder}}
\]

\[
36 \pi = \pi r^2 \times 4
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the Radius of the Cylinder

Cancel \(\pi\) from both sides:

\[
36 = 4r^2
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
r^2 = \frac{36}{4} = 9
\]

Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

\[
r = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Therefore, the radius of the resulting cylinder is 3 cm.

   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times 225 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 20 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Simplifying inside the multiplication:

   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times 4500 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

   Divide 4500 by 3:

   \[
   V = 1500 \, \text{cm}^3

In a slide calipers, 19 divisions of the main scale are equal to 20 divisions of the vernier scale. When a small rod is placed between the jaws of the calipers, it is found that the zero mark of the vernier scale crosses the 5.2 cm mark of the main scale. Furthermore, the 14th mark of the vernier scale coincides with one of the marks on the main scale. What is the length of the rod in centimeters?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Vernier Caliper Configuration:**
   - Let the least count (LC) of the vernier calipers be calculated.
   - The least count is the difference in the value of one main scale division (MSD) and one vernier scale division (VSD).

2. **Calculating the Value of Vernier Scale Division:**
   \[
   \text{Length of 19 main scale divisions} = \text{Length of 20 vernier scale divisions}
   \]
   If each main scale division is `x` cm, then:
   \[
   19x = 20 \times \text{VSD}
   \]
   Thus, each vernier scale division (VSD) is:
   \[
   \text{VSD} = \frac{19}{20}x
   \]

3. **Calculating Least Count (LC):**
   \[
   \text{LC} = \text{MSD} - \text{VSD} = x - \frac{19}{20}x = \frac{x}{20}

4. **Determining the Vernier Scale Reading:**
   - The zero mark of the vernier is on the 5.2 cm of the main scale.
   - The 14th vernier mark aligns with a mark on the main scale, indicating how much extra beyond 5.2 cm the vernier scale reads.
   - Since they coincide at the 14th division, the vernier reading is \(14 \times \text{LC}\).

   ""A solution of 750 mL contains 0.125 molar potassium carbonate. How many grams of potassium carbonate are in this solution?""

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To find the amount of potassium carbonate in grams in the solution, follow these steps:

   **Step 1:** Understand the given information.
   
   - Molarity (M) = 0.125 mol/L
   - Volume of the solution = 750 mL = 0.750 L (since 1 L = 1000 mL)

   **Step 2:** Calculate the moles of potassium carbonate.

   The formula for molarity is:
   \[
   \text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}
   \]

   Rearrange this formula to find the moles of solute (potassium carbonate):
   \[
   \text{moles of solute} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{liters of solution}
   \]

   Substituting the known values gives:
   \[
   \text{moles of potassium carbonate} = 0.125 \, \text{mol/L} \times 0.750 \, \text{L} = 0.09375 \, \text{mol}
   \]

   **Step 3:** Calculate the mass of potassium carbonate.

   The molar mass of potassium carbonate (\(\text{K}_2\text{CO}_3\)) is calculated by adding the atomic masses of its constituent atoms:
   
   - Potassium (K): approximately 39.10 g/mol, and there are two potassium atoms.
   - Carbon (C): approximately 12.01 g/mol
   - Oxygen (O): approximately 16.00 g/mol, and there are three oxygen atoms.

   Therefore, the molar mass of \(\text{K}_2\text{CO}_3\) is:

A slide calipers' main scale has the smallest division of 1 mm. The Vernier scale has 10 divisions. What is the Vernier constant in cm?

## Step-by-step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a Vernier caliper and the Vernier constant.

### 1. Understanding the Division on the Scales:
- The main scale of a Vernier caliper is marked in millimeters. Therefore, the smallest division, which is given to be 1 mm, corresponds to 0.1 cm (since 1 mm = 0.1 cm).

### 2. Determine the Length of the Vernier Scale:
- The Vernier scale is composed of 10 divisions.
- These 10 divisions together on the Vernier scale must theoretically match a different number of exact divisions on the main scale.
- In a typical Vernier caliper, the length of these 10 divisions on the Vernier scale is equal to 9 divisions on the main scale.

### 3. Calculating the Vernier Constant:
- Each Vernier division is therefore shorter than a main scale division because 10 divisions of Vernier are equivalent to 9 divisions of the main scale.
  
  \[
  \text{1 Vernier division} = \frac{9 \times 1\, \text{mm}}{10} = 0.9 \, \text{mm}
  \]

- The Vernier constant is calculated as the difference between one main scale division and one Vernier division:
  
  \[
  \text{Vernier Constant} = 1 \, \text{mm} - 0.9 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{mm}
  \]

- Convert the Vernier constant from mm to cm:
  
  \[
  0.1 \, \text{mm} = 0.01 \, \text{cm}

Thus, the Vernier constant is 0.01 cm.

### Step 2: Detailed step-by-step solution

1. **Determine the chemical formula of magnesium nitrate:**
   - Magnesium nitrate is chemically represented as \( \text{Mg(NO}_3\text{)}_2 \).

2. **Calculate the molar mass of magnesium nitrate:**
   - First, let's find the atomic masses from the periodic table:
     - Magnesium (Mg) has an atomic mass of approximately \( 24.31 \, \text{g/mol} \).
     - Nitrogen (N) has an atomic mass of approximately \( 14.01 \, \text{g/mol} \).
     - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately \( 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} \).
   - Therefore, the molar mass of magnesium nitrate \( \text{Mg(NO}_3\text{)}_2 \) is calculated as follows:
     - Magnesium: \( 1 \times 24.31 = 24.31 \, \text{g/mol} \)
     - Nitrogen: \( 2 \times 14.01 = 28.02 \, \text{g/mol} \) (since there are 2 nitrogen atoms in the compound)
     - Oxygen: \( 6 \times 16.00 = 96.00 \, \text{g/mol} \) (since there are 6 oxygen atoms in the compound)
   - Adding them up gives us the molar mass of magnesium nitrate:
     \[
     24.31 + 28.02 + 96.00 = 148.33 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]

3. **Find the percentage of oxygen in magnesium nitrate:**
   - The mass contribution of oxygen in the compound is \( 96.00 \, \text{g/mol} \).
   - To find the percentage of oxygen, use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of oxygen} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of oxygen per mole}}{\text{Molar mass of Mg(NO}_3\text{)}_2} \right) \times 100

2. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To find the total reading using a vernier caliper, we need to understand the components involved:

   - **Main Scale Reading (MSR):** This is the direct reading from the main scale. According to the problem, the main scale reading is 14 mm.

   - **Vernier Constant (VC):** This is the smallest measurement that can be read using the vernier scale. In this case, it is provided as 0.1 mm.

   - **Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):** This is the reading from the vernier scale itself. The vernier reading given is 3.

   The total reading (TR) on the vernier caliper is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Total Reading (TR)} = \text{Main Scale Reading (MSR)} + (\text{Vernier Scale Reading (VSR)} \times \text{Vernier Constant (VC)})
   \]

   Plug in the values given:

   - MSR = 14 mm
   - VSR = 3
   - VC = 0.1 mm

What is the distance traveled by the second hand of a wall clock in one minute?

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, let's go through the process of determining the distance traveled by the second hand of a clock in one minute.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Every clock, including a wall clock, typically has a second hand that moves around a circular path. 
   - One complete revolution of the second hand around the clock corresponds to one minute since there are 60 seconds in a minute.

2. **Geometry of the Clock:**
   - The path traveled by the second hand is a circle. Therefore, we need to calculate the circumference of this circle.
   - Let's denote the length of the second hand as \( r \) (this represents the radius of the circular path).

3. **Formula for Circumference:**
   - The formula to calculate the circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by:
     \[ C = 2 \pi r \]
   - This formula will give us the distance covered in one complete revolution, which is one minute.

4. **Calculating the Distance:**
   - Let's assume the typical length of a second hand is around 0.15 meters (or 15 cm), as this is a common size for wall clocks.
   - Substitute \( r = 0.15 \) meters into the formula:
     \[ C = 2 \pi \times 0.15 \]
     \[ C = 0.3 \pi \]

5. **Approximating the Distance:**
   - We know that \( \pi \) (pi) is approximately \( 3.14159 \).
   - Therefore, calculate:
     \[ C \approx 0.3 \times 3.14159 \]
     \[ C \approx 0.942477 \]

Thus, the distance traveled by the second hand in one minute is approximately 0.942 meters.

A body has a mass of 2 kg and an initial velocity of 5 m/s. After 3 seconds, the velocity of the body becomes 8 m/s. What is the force applied on the body in newtons?

## 2. Step-by-step Solution with Explanations:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the force applied on the body. This can be done by using Newton's second law of motion which states:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

### Step 1: Calculate the Acceleration

The acceleration \( a \) can be calculated using the formula for acceleration:

\[ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} \]

where:
- \( v_f = 8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the final velocity,
- \( v_i = 5 \, \text{m/s} \) is the initial velocity,
- \( t = 3 \, \text{s} \) is the time over which the change occurs.

Plugging in these values:

\[ a = \frac{8 \, \text{m/s} - 5 \, \text{m/s}}{3 \, \text{s}} = \frac{3 \, \text{m/s}}{3 \, \text{s}} = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Force

Now, using the mass of the body \( m = 2 \, \text{kg} \) and the acceleration \( a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we can find the force:

\[ F = m \cdot a = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 2 \, \text{N} \]

How many grams of decimolar hydrochloric acid are required to neutralize 10 ml of 0.2 Molar sodium carbonate?

## Step-by-Step Solution
To solve this problem, we need to understand the chemical reaction between sodium carbonate (\( \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 \)) and hydrochloric acid (\( \text{HCl} \)). The balanced chemical equation is:

\[ 
\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_2 
\]

1. **Determine moles of sodium carbonate:**
   - Given: Volume of \(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3\) = 10 ml = 0.01 L
   - Molarity of \(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3\) = 0.2 M

   Moles of \(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3\) = Molarity × Volume = \(0.2 \, \text{mol/L} \times 0.01 \, \text{L} = 0.002 \, \text{mol}\).

2. **Relate moles of reactants using stoichiometry:**
   According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of \(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3\) reacts with 2 moles of \(\text{HCl}\).

   Therefore, moles of \( \text{HCl} \) needed = 2 × moles of \(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3\) = \( 2 \times 0.002 \, \text{mol} = 0.004 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate grams of HCl required:**
   - Molarity of HCl = 0.1 M (decimolar) implies 1 L of solution contains 0.1 mol HCl.
   - Thus, to get 0.004 moles of \(\text{HCl}\), the volume of HCl required = \(\dfrac{0.004 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{mol/L}} = 0.04"

The problem in English is:  
“If a wheel has a diameter of 3.1416 meters, what is the circumference of the wheel?”

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we need to find the circumference of a circle (in this case, a wheel) when its diameter is given. The formula to calculate the circumference (C) of a circle is:

\[ C = \pi \times d \]

where:
- \( C \) is the circumference,
- \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \) (often approximated as \( 3.1416 \) for precision in some cases),
- \( d \) is the diameter of the circle.

### Given:
- Diameter \( d = 3.1416 \) meters.

### Calculation:
Substitute the given diameter into the formula:

\[ C = \pi \times 3.1416 \]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \) (as very close approximations are used for accurate results here):

\[ C = 3.1416 \times 3.1416 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ C = 3.1416 \times 3.1416 = 9.8696 \]

Therefore, the circumference of the wheel is 9.8696 meters.

The problem in Bengali is asking: ""What is the molecular weight of 3 moles of methane?""

### Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the molecular weight of methane for 3 moles. However, molecular weight is typically expressed per mole, not for multiple moles. 
   - Methane (\( \text{CH}_4 \)) is composed of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.

2. **Calculating the Molecular Weight of Methane:**
   - The atomic weight of Carbon (\( \text{C} \)) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.
   - The atomic weight of Hydrogen (\( \text{H} \)) is approximately 1.008 g/mol.
   - Therefore, the molecular weight of methane is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of } \text{CH}_4 = (1 \times 12.01 \, g/mol) + (4 \times 1.008 \, g/mol)
     \]
     \[
     = 12.01 \, g/mol + 4.032 \, g/mol
     \]
     \[
     = 16.042 \, g/mol
     \]

3. **Calculating for 3 Moles:**
   - The problem mentions 3 moles, but molecular weight is typically per mole. Thus, the molecular weight of 3 moles would be 3 times the molecular weight of 1 mole:
     \[
     \text{Total weight for 3 moles} = 3 \times 16.042 \, g/mol
     \]
     \[
     = 48.126 \, g
     \]
   - However, recall that the ""molecular weight"" of a compound remains constant per mole, and when asked for molecular weight, it is customary to provide the value for one mole rather than a total weight for multiple moles.

### Conclusion:

The molecular weight of methane is constant at **16.042 g/mol**, regardless of the number of moles calculated for.

When a piece of wood is floated on water, what percentage of it will be submerged? (Density of wood = \(0.40 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3\), Density of water = \(1 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3\))

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the wood is submerged when it floats on water. This situation can be analyzed using Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Density of wood, \( \rho_{\text{wood}} = 0.40 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
   - Density of water, \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)

2. **Understand the Principle:**
   - For an object floating in equilibrium, the buoyant force equals the weight of the object.
   - The buoyant force equals the weight of the water displaced by the submerged part of the object.

3. **Equation Relating to Submerged Volume:**
   \[
   V_{\text{sub}} \cdot \rho_{\text{water}} = V_{\text{total}} \cdot \rho_{\text{wood}}
   \]
   where:
   - \( V_{\text{sub}} \) = Submerged volume of the wood
   - \( V_{\text{total}} \) = Total volume of the wood

4. **Ratio of Submerged to Total Volume:**
   - Rearrange the equation:
   \[
   \frac{V_{\text{sub}}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{wood}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Submerged Percentage:**
   \[
   \frac{V_{\text{sub}}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.40 \times 10^3}{1 \times 10^3} = 0.40
   \]
   - This means 40% of the wood's total volume is submerged.

This calculation shows that 40 percent of the wood will be submerged when it floats"

To find the wavelength, we can use the formula: 

\[ \text{Wavelength} (\lambda) = \frac{\text{Velocity of the wave} (v)}{\text{Frequency} (f)} \]

Given:
- Frequency, \( f = 630 \) kilohertz \( = 630 \times 10^3 \) hertz
- Velocity, \( v = 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

\[ \lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{630 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz}} \]

\[ \lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{630 \times 10^3} \]

\[ \lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{630 \times 10^3} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{630} \]

Now, let's simplify:

\[ \lambda = \frac{300000}{630} \]

To further simplify:

- Divide the numerator by 630:
\[ \frac{300000}{630} = 476.19 \]

Therefore, the wavelength of the radio wave is approximately 476.19 meters.

If a 10-gram weight is hung with a 0.1-meter long string, what will be the period of oscillation of the pendulum?

### Step-by-Step Solution

To find the period of oscillation of the pendulum, we use the formula for the period of a simple pendulum:

\[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \]

Where:
- \( T \) is the period of oscillation,
- \( L \) is the length of the pendulum (in meters),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on Earth).

In this problem:
- The length \( L \) is given as \( 0.1 \) meters.
- The mass of the weight (10 grams) does not affect the period, as \( T \) is independent of mass.

Now substitute the values into the formula:

\[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.1}{9.8}} \]

First, calculate the value inside the square root:

\[ \frac{0.1}{9.8} \approx 0.0102041 \]

Then, take the square root:

\[ \sqrt{0.0102041} \approx 0.1010149 \]

Next, multiply by \( 2\pi \) to find \( T \):

\[ T = 2\pi \times 0.1010149 \]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[ T \approx 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.1010149 \]
\[ T \approx 0.634008 \]

To prepare 500 milliliters of a 0.2 molar solution, how many grams of table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) are required?

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding Molarity:**

     \[
     M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}

A rod is placed between the two jaws of a slide caliper, and the reading obtained is as follows: the main scale shows 6 cm, the vernier coincides at 4, and the vernier constant is 0.1 mm. What is the length of the rod in cm?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Vernier Caliper:**
   - The vernier caliper reading consists of two parts: the main scale reading (MSR) and the vernier scale reading (VSR).
   - The MSR is the measurement on the main scale just before the zero of the vernier scale.
   - The VSR is determined by the line on the vernier scale that coincides with a line on the main scale.

2. **Given Data:**
   - Main Scale Reading (MSR) = 6 cm
   - Vernier Coincidence (VC) = 4 (this tells us which mark of the vernier scale aligns with the main scale)
   - Vernier Constant (VC) = 0.1 mm = 0.01 cm (since 1 mm = 0.1 cm)

3. **Calculating the Vernier Scale Reading (VSR):**
   - The VSR can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{VSR} = \text{Vernier Coincidence} \times \text{Vernier Constant}

4. **Calculating the Total Length:**
   - The total length of the rod as measured by the caliper is the sum of the MSR and the VSR:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = \text{MSR} + \text{VSR} = 6 \, \text{cm} + 0.04 \, \text{cm}

5 grams of hydrogen gas are reacted with 30 grams of nitrogen gas. What is the total mass of the product?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand what reaction occurs between hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas. The chemical reaction between hydrogen (H₂) and nitrogen (N₂) is known to produce ammonia (NH₃), and the balanced chemical equation is as follows:

\[ N_2 + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3 \]

### Step 1: Analyze the stoichiometry of the reaction
From the balanced equation:
- 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to produce 2 moles of ammonia.

### Step 2: Calculate the molar masses
- Molar mass of hydrogen (H₂) = 2 grams/mole
- Molar mass of nitrogen (N₂) = 28 grams/mole
- Molar mass of ammonia (NH₃) = 17 grams/mole

### Step 3: Calculate the number of moles available
Given:
- Mass of hydrogen = 5 grams
- Mass of nitrogen = 30 grams

Calculate moles of hydrogen:
\[ \text{Moles of } H_2 = \frac{5 \text{ grams}}{2 \text{ grams/mole}} = 2.5 \text{ moles} \]

Calculate moles of nitrogen:
\[ \text{Moles of } N_2 = \frac{30 \text{ grams}}{28 \text{ grams/mole}} \approx 1.07 \text{ moles} \]

### Step 4: Determine the limiting reagent
Using the stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation (1:3):
- Moles of nitrogen needed for 2.5 moles of hydrogen = \(\frac{2.5}{3} \approx 0.83 \text{ moles of } N_2 \)

Available nitrogen is 1.07 moles, which is greater than 0.83 moles required, implying nitrogen is in excess. Therefore, hydrogen is the limiting reagent.

### Step 5: Calculate the mass of ammonia produced

- 3 moles of hydrogen produce 2 moles of ammonia.

From 2.5 moles of hydrogen, the moles of ammonia produced:

\[ C = 2 \pi \times 10 = 20 \pi \text{ meters} \]

### Step 3: Determine the Covered Arc Length
Since we are covering one-fourth of the circumference:
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \frac{1}{4} \times C = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \pi = 5 \pi \text{ meters} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Displacement
In a circle, when one moves along an arc and finishes one-fourth of its total circumference, the displacement is simply the chord connecting the start and the end points of the arc.

The chord of a circle corresponding to one-fourth of the circumference forms a right-angled isosceles triangle (since it subtends a central angle of \(90^\circ\)). In this case, each radius along with the chord forms the two equal sides of the triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
- Let the length of the chord = \( d \).
- The triangle's sides are the radii (\( 10 \) meters each), forming a right angle.

\[ r^2 + r^2 = d^2 \]
\[ 2 \times (10)^2 = d^2 \]
\[ 200 = d^2 \]
\[ d = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the displacement is the length of this chord.

An object's shape is a rectangular prism, with a length of 6 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is its volume in cubic centimeters?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the volume of a rectangular prism, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]

Given values:
- Length (\(L\)) = 6 cm
- Width (\(W\)) = 5 cm
- Height (\(H\)) = 5 cm

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \]

Now perform the multiplication step-by-step:

First, multiply the length and width:

\[ 6 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 30 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Next, multiply the result by the height:

\[ 30 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 150 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Therefore, the volume of the rectangular prism is 150 cubic centimeters.

If two coins are tossed together, what is the probability that two heads do not occur?

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the probability that two heads do not occur when two coins are tossed, we need to consider the possible outcomes and calculate the required probability.

1. **Identify the Total Possible Outcomes:**

   When two coins are tossed, each coin can land in one of two ways: heads (H) or tails (T). So, the possible outcomes for two coins are:
   
   1. HH (Head on first coin, Head on second coin)
   2. HT (Head on first coin, Tail on second coin)
   3. TH (Tail on first coin, Head on second coin)
   4. TT (Tail on first coin, Tail on second coin)
   
   This gives us a total of 4 possible outcomes.

2. **Find the Favorable Outcomes for ""Two Heads Do Not Occur"":**

   We are interested in the outcomes where ""two heads do not occur"". These outcomes are:
   
   - HT (Head on first, Tail on second)
   - TH (Tail on first, Head on second)
   - TT (Tail on both)
   
   Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes where two heads do not occur.

3. **Calculate the Probability:**

   Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Thus, the probability \( P \) of two heads not occurring is:
   
   \[
   P(\text{not two heads}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{4}

10 grams of sodium hydroxide reacted with 5 grams of carbon dioxide. How many grams of salt are produced?

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to consider the chemical reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) to form sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and water (H₂O):

\[ 2 \text{NaOH} + \text{CO}_2 \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

**Step 1: Determine the molar masses of reactants and products.**

- Molar mass of NaOH = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol
- Molar mass of CO₂ = 12 (C) + 16×2 (O) = 44 g/mol
- Molar mass of Na₂CO₃ = 23×2 (Na) + 12 (C) + 16×3 (O) = 106 g/mol

**Step 2: Determine the moles of each reactant.**

- Moles of NaOH = \( \frac{10 \text{ g}}{40 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.25 \text{ mol} \)
- Moles of CO₂ = \( \frac{5 \text{ g}}{44 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.114 \text{ mol} \)

**Step 3: Identify the limiting reactant.**

Based on the balanced chemical equation:

\[ 2 \text{ mol NaOH} : 1 \text{ mol CO}_2 \]

- For 0.25 mol of NaOH, the required moles of CO₂ = \( \frac{0.25}{2} = 0.125 \text{ mol} \)
  
  However, we only have 0.114 mol of CO₂, so CO₂ is the limiting reactant.

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of product formed.**

Since CO₂ is the limiting reactant, it will determine the amount of sodium carbonate formed:

- According to the reaction stoichiometry, 1 mol of CO₂ produces 1 mol of Na₂CO₃.
  
- Therefore, 0.114 mol of CO₂ will produce 0."

2. **Step-by-step Solution:**

   To determine the molecular weight of 9 moles of glucose, we first need to identify the molecular weight of a single molecule of glucose. The chemical formula for glucose is \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 \).

   - **Atomic weights:**
     - Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu).
     - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1 amu.
     - Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16 amu.

   - **Calculate the molecular weight of a single molecule of glucose:**

     The molecular weight of glucose is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of glucose} = (6 \, \text{atoms of C} \times 12 \, \text{amu}) + (12 \, \text{atoms of H} \times 1 \, \text{amu}) + (6 \, \text{atoms of O} \times 16 \, \text{amu})

What is the number of proper subsets if a set has 5 elements?

## Solution:

Given a set with 5 elements, we need to determine how many proper subsets this set has.

### Understanding the Concept:

A **subset** is any combination of elements from a set, while a **proper subset** is any subset that is not equal to the original set. In simpler terms, a proper subset must contain fewer elements than the original set.

### Calculating All Subsets:

To find the total number of subsets of a set with 'n' elements, we use the formula:

\[
2^n
\]

This formula comes from the possibility of including or not including each element in a subset (2 choices per element).

For a set with 5 elements, the total number of subsets is:

\[
2^5 = 32
\]

### Calculating Proper Subsets:

Since a proper subset cannot be the same as the entire set, we exclude the subset that includes all elements, which means we subtract 1 from the total number of subsets.

Therefore, the number of proper subsets is:

\[
2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31
\]

This subtraction accounts for excluding the complete set itself from the list of all possible subsets, leaving only the proper subsets.

### Conclusion:

The number of proper subsets of a set with 5 elements is:

   In a right-angled triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the unknown side. The Pythagorean theorem states:
   
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]

   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two perpendicular sides (base and perpendicular), and \( c \) is the hypotenuse. According to the problem, we have:
   - Perpendicular \( = 4 \)
   - Hypotenuse \( = 5 \)

   We need to find the base (\( b \)):

   Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   
   \[
   4^2 + b^2 = 5^2
   \]

   Calculate \( 4^2 \) and \( 5^2 \):
   
   \[
   16 + b^2 = 25
   \]

   To isolate \( b^2 \), subtract 16 from both sides:

   \[
   b^2 = 25 - 16
   \]

   So, 

   \[
   b^2 = 9
   \]

   Taking the square root of both sides to solve for \( b \):

   \[
   b = \sqrt{9}

   Therefore,

   \[
   b = 3

In a container, the heat capacity of some water is 6090 Joules/Kelvin. What is the mass of the water in kilograms?

## Step-by-Step Solution

To find the mass of the water, we can use the concept of specific heat capacity. The formula to relate heat capacity, specific heat, and mass is:

\[
C = m \times c
\]

where:
- \( C \) is the heat capacity in Joules/Kelvin,
- \( m \) is the mass in kilograms,
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of water, which is typically \( 4,186 \, \text{J/kg} \cdot \text{K} \).

Given:
- Heat capacity, \( C = 6090 \, \text{J/K} \).

We need to find \( m \), the mass of the water.

Substitute \( C \) and \( c \) into the formula:

\[
6090 = m \times 4186
\]

To solve for \( m \), divide both sides by 4186:

\[
m = \frac{6090}{4186}

   - Given the radius of the sphere \( r = 4 \) cm, the diameter \( d \) of the sphere (and the cylinder) is \( 2 \times r = 8 \) cm.

2. **Dimensions of the Cylinder:**
   - Since the sphere fits perfectly:
     - The height \( h \) of the cylinder equals the diameter of the sphere, \( h = 8 \) cm.
     - The radius \( R \) of the cylinder equals the radius of the sphere, \( R = 4 \) cm.

3. **Formula for the Volume of a Cylinder:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \pi R^2 h

   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00 u.

3. **Molecular Weight of Carbon Monoxide (CO):**
   - Carbon monoxide (CO) is composed of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom.
   - Thus, the molecular mass of CO = atomic mass of C + atomic mass of O 
   - = 12.01 u + 16.00 u 
   - = 28.01 u

4. **Calculating the Mass of 3 Moles of CO:**
   - The mass of one mole of a substance (molar mass) in grams per mole (g/mol) is numerically equal to its molecular weight in atomic mass units.
   - Therefore, the molar mass of CO = 28.01 g/mol.
   - Mass of 3 moles of CO = 3 moles × 28.01 g/mol = 84.03 g

### Conclusion:
The molecular weight of 3 moles of carbon monoxide is 84.03 grams.

227,একটি মুদ্রা ১ বার নিক্ষেপ করলে হেড পাবার সম্ভাবনা ০.৮০। মুদ্রাটি ৪০০ বার নিক্ষেপ করলে কতবার টেল আসতে পারে?,৮০,Math,Probability,"**Translated Problem:**

The probability of getting heads when a coin is tossed once is 0.80. If the coin is tossed 400 times, how many times can tails possibly occur?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times tails can occur in 400 tosses of a coin, given the probability of getting heads.

Step-by-step solution:

1. **Understand the Probability of Tails:**

   The probability of getting heads (H) when a coin is tossed once is given as 0.80. 

   Since there are only two possible outcomes when a coin is tossed - heads or tails - the probability of getting tails (T) can be determined using the complementary probability rule:

   \[
   P(T) = 1 - P(H)
   \]

   Given, \( P(H) = 0.80 \),

   \[
   P(T) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20
   \]

2. **Calculate the Expected Number of Tails in 400 Tosses:**

   If each toss of the coin is independent, then the expected number of times tails will occur when the coin is tossed 400 times is given by multiplying the probability of tails with the number of tosses:

   \[
   E(\text{Number of Tails}) = P(T) \times \text{Total Number of Tosses}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   E(\text{Number of Tails}) = 0.20 \times 400 = 80
   \]

Thus, if the coin is tossed 400 times, tails can possibly occur approximately 80 times.

**Answer: 80**"
