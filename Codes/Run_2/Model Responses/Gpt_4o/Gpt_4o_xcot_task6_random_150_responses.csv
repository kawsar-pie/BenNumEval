317,৬৫১২০১ থেকে কোন ক্ষুদ্রতম সংখ্যা বিয়োগ করলে বিয়োগফল একটি পূর্ণবর্গসংখ্যা হবে ?,১৫৬৫,"## Translation of the Problem:

The original Bengali problem is: ""৬৫১২০১ থেকে কোন ক্ষুদ্রতম সংখ্যা বিয়োগ করলে বিয়োগফল একটি পূর্ণবর্গসংখ্যা হবে ?""

Translated into English, it reads: ""What smallest number should be subtracted from 651201 so that the result is a perfect square?""

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We need to determine the smallest number that, when subtracted from 651201, results in a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer.

2. **Identify the Nearest Perfect Square:**
   First, we estimate the square root of 651201 to find the nearest perfect square. Let's find the integer part of the square root of 651201.

   \[
   \text{Square root of 651201} \approx \sqrt{651201} \approx 807
   \]

3. **Calculate the Perfect Square:**
   The integer 807 squared gives us:

   \[
   807^2 = 651249
   \]

   This value (651249) is greater than 651201, indicating that 807 is not the square root we need.

4. **Try the Next Integer Below:**
   Since 807 squared is too large, we try the next integer below 807, which is 806.

   \[
   806^2 = 649636
   \]

5. **Calculate the Difference:**
   We then subtract the result (649636) from 651201 to see what number needs to be subtracted:

   \[
   651201 - 649636 = 1565
   \]

   Therefore, subtracting 1565 from 651201 gives us a perfect square (806^2).

6. **Verification:**
   Verify the calculation:
   - Subtract: \( 651201 - 1565 = 649636 \)
   - Check if 649636 is a perfect square by computing \(\sqrt{649636}\), which confirms to be 806.

Thus, the smallest number that needs to be subtracted from 651201 to result in a perfect square is 1565.

Find the smaller number such that their sum is 147 and is 4 more than 0.375 times the other number.

### Step-by-Step Solution

Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \) is the smaller number and \( y \) is the larger number.

**Equations to Formulate the Problem:**

1. The sum of the two numbers is 147:
   \[
   x + y = 147
   \]

2. The smaller number, \( x \), is 4 more than 0.375 times the larger number, \( y \):
   \[
   x = 0.375y + 4
   \]

**Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:**

Substitute the expression for \( x \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
\[
0.375y + 4 + y = 147
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
0.375y + y = 143
\]
\[
1.375y = 143
\]

**Solve for \( y \):**

Divide both sides by 1.375:
\[
y = \frac{143}{1.375} \approx 104
\]

**Find \( x \) using \( y = 104 \):**

Substitute \( y = 104 \) back into Equation 2:
\[
x = 0.375(104) + 4
\]
Calculate \( 0.375 \times 104 \):
\[
0.375 \times 104 = 39
\]
So,
\[
x = 39 + 4 = 43
\]

Thus, the smaller number \( x \) is 43.

The difference between the current ages of a father and son is 15 years. What will be the difference in their ages after 30 years?

## Solution:
1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Currently, the father is older than the son by 15 years.
   - We need to determine the age difference between the father and the son 30 years from now.

2. **Key Observation**:
   - Age differences remain constant over time. This is due to the fact that both individuals age at the same rate (both grow one year older each year).

3. **Mathematical Representation**:
   - Let the father's current age be \( F \) and the son's current age be \( S \).
   - The problem gives us the following equation based on the current age difference: 
     \[
     F - S = 15
     \]

4. **After 30 years**:
   - The father's age will be \( F + 30 \).
   - The son's age will be \( S + 30 \).

5. **Calculate the difference in their ages after 30 years**:

Ahmed has 4 kg of oil. If the weight of 1 liter of oil is \( \frac{6}{7} \) kg, how many liters of oil does he have?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the given information:**

   - Total weight of the oil Ahmed has = 4 kg.
   - Weight of 1 liter of oil = \( \frac{6}{7} \) kg.

2. **Objective:**

   - We need to find out how many liters of oil correspond to the 4 kg of oil Ahmed has.

3. **Set up the equation:**

   To find out how many liters of oil Ahmed has, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Number of liters of oil} = \frac{\text{Total weight of oil}}{\text{Weight of 1 liter of oil}}
   \]

   Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:

   \[
   \text{Number of liters of oil} = \frac{4 \text{ kg}}{\frac{6}{7} \text{ kg/liter}}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of liters:**

   Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore:

   \[
   \text{Number of liters of oil} = 4 \times \frac{7}{6}
   \]

   Now, perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Number of liters of oil} = \frac{4 \times 7}{6} = \frac{28}{6}
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction:**

   Simplify \( \frac{28}{6} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

   \[
   \text{Number of liters of oil} = \frac{28 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{14}{3}
   \]

   Converting the improper fraction to a mixed number, we get:

   \[
   \frac{14}{3} = 4 \frac{2}{3}
   \]

   Therefore, Ahmed has \( 4 \frac{2}{3} \) liters of oil.

The Panchayat has sent saplings to the sixth-grade students of Jadunath Vidyamandir School to plant them in the school garden. It was found that if the saplings were planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30, each row had the same number of saplings. Calculate the minimum number of saplings sent by the Panchayat.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number that can be evenly divided by 20, 24, and 30. This means we are looking for the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
First, we perform the prime factorization of each number:

- \( 20 = 2^2 \times 5 \)
- \( 24 = 2^3 \times 3 \)
- \( 30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \)

### Step 2: Identify Maximum Powers
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2: \( 2^3 \) (from 24)
- The highest power of 3: \( 3^1 \) (from 24 and 30)
- The highest power of 5: \( 5^1 \) (from 20 and 30)

### Step 3: Calculate the LCM
We calculate the LCM by multiplying these maximum powers together:

\[
LCM = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 8 \times 3 \times 5
\]

Now, perform the multiplications:

\[
8 \times 3 = 24
\]
\[
24 \times 5 = 120
\]

The least common multiple of 20, 24, and 30 is 120.

Therefore, the Panchayat must have sent at least 120 saplings.

""Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9786 kg and 2796 kg.""

## Step 2: Detailed Step-by-Step Solution in English

To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method to compute the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm.

### Applying the Euclidean Algorithm:

1. **Initial Values:**
    - \( a = 9786 \)
    - \( b = 2796 \)

2. **Step 1: First Division**
    - Divide 9786 by 2796 and find the remainder.
    - \( 9786 \div 2796 = 3 \) remainder \( 1398 \)
    - So, \( 9786 = 2796 \times 3 + 1398 \)

3. **Step 2: Second Division**
    - Now consider 2796 and 1398.
    - Divide 2796 by 1398 and find the remainder.
    - \( 2796 \div 1398 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \)
    - So, \( 2796 = 1398 \times 2 + 0 \)

4. **Result:**
    - The remainder is now 0, and according to the Euclidean algorithm, when the remainder reaches 0, the divisor at this step is the GCD.
    - Therefore, the GCD of 9786 and 2796 is 1398.

## Conclusion
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9786 kg and 2796 kg is **1398 kg**.

There are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 shirts in stock. These items have been evenly distributed among several families. How many dhotis will each family receive?

### Solution:
To determine how many dhotis each family receives, we need to divide the total number of dhotis, 1071, by the number of families. However, since the distribution is meant to be equal for all items (dhotis, saris, and shirts), the number of families should be such that it divides each type of item completely.

This means we have to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three quantities: 1071, 595, and 357. This GCD will give us the number of families, as it is the largest number that perfectly divides each item.

1. **Find the GCD of 1071, 595, and 357:**

   - First, find the GCD of 1071 and 595 using the Euclidean algorithm:
     - 1071 ÷ 595 = 1 remainder 476
     - 595 ÷ 476 = 1 remainder 119
     - 476 ÷ 119 = 4 remainder 0

     So, GCD(1071, 595) = 119.

   - Next, find the GCD of 119 and 357:
     - 357 ÷ 119 = 3 remainder 0

     So, GCD(119, 357) = 119.

   Therefore, the GCD of 1071, 595, and 357 is 119.

2. **Number of families:**
   - Since the GCD is 119, the items are distributed among 119 families.

3. **Determine how many dhotis each family receives:**
   - Now, divide the total number of dhotis by the number of families:
     - 1071 ÷ 119 = 9

Each family receives 9 dhotis.

Fayaz and Ayaz have some apples. If Fayaz gives 10 apples to Ayaz, the number of apples Ayaz will have becomes three times the number of apples Fayaz has. Additionally, if Ayaz gives 20 apples to Fayaz, the number of apples Fayaz has becomes twice the number Ayaz has. How many apples does Ayaz have?

## Step-by-Step Solution

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the number of apples Fayaz has initially.
- \( A \) as the number of apples Ayaz has initially.

### Step 1: Analyze the First Condition
According to the problem, if Fayaz gives 10 apples to Ayaz:
- Fayaz's apples become \( F - 10 \).
- Ayaz's apples become \( A + 10 \).

The condition states:
\[ A + 10 = 3(F - 10) \]

This can be expanded and simplified as follows:
\[ A + 10 = 3F - 30 \]
\[ A = 3F - 40 \]  \[ \text{(Equation 1)} \]

### Step 2: Analyze the Second Condition
The problem also states that if Ayaz gives 20 apples to Fayaz:
- Fayaz's apples become \( F + 20 \).
- Ayaz's apples become \( A - 20 \).

This condition leads to:
\[ F + 20 = 2(A - 20) \]

Expanding and simplifying gives:
\[ F + 20 = 2A - 40 \]
\[ F = 2A - 60 \]   \[ \text{(Equation 2)} \]

### Step 3: Solve the Equations Simultaneously

Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:
\[ A = 3(2A - 60) - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 180 - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 220 \]

Re-arrange to solve for \( A \):
\[ 220 = 5A \]
\[ A = 44 \]

Thus, the initial number of apples Ayaz had is 44.

### Conclusion
The solution derived from the simultaneous equations yields the number of apples Ayaz initially had.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the average number of hours Reza studied per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Hours Studied:**
   We add up the hours Reza studied each day over the week.

   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 2 + 1.5 + 1 + 1.5 + 1 + 2 + 5
   \]

   Adding these values:

   \[
   = 2 + 1.5 + 1 + 1.5 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 14
   \]

   Reza studied a total of 14 hours over the 7 days.

2. **Calculate the Average Hours Per Day:**
   To find the daily average, divide the total hours by the number of days in the week.

   \[
   \text{Average Hours per Day} = \frac{\text{Total Hours}}{\text{Number of Days}}

The base of a triangular field is 24 meters and the height is 15 meters and 50 centimeters. Determine its area.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the Height to Meters
The given height of the triangle is 15 meters and 50 centimeters. First, we should convert this measurement entirely into meters for consistency with the base measurement.

50 centimeters is equal to 0.5 meters because 100 centimeters = 1 meter.

Thus:
- Height in meters = 15 meters + 0.5 meters = 15.5 meters

### Step 2: Substitute the Values into the Formula
Now we have:
- Base = 24 meters
- Height = 15.5 meters

Substitute these values into the area formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \times 15.5
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Calculations
First, calculate the product of the base and the height:
\[
24 \times 15.5 = 372
\]

Then, calculate half of this product to find the area:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 372 = 186
\]

Therefore, the area of the triangular field is 186 square meters.

     \[
     2 \times (L + W) = 40
     \]
   - Substituting \( L = 3W \) into the equation gives:
     \[
     2 \times (3W + W) = 40
     \]

4. **Solving for the Width \( W \):**
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     2 \times 4W = 40
     \]
   - Further simplification:
     \[
     8W = 40
     \]

Find the nearest perfect square number to 1000.

## 2. Step-by-Step Solution:
To find the nearest perfect square to 1000, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify two nearest integers whose squares are around 1000.**
   - We need to find a perfect square close to 1000, which means we need a number \( n \) such that \( n^2 \approx 1000 \).
   - Start by estimating the square root of 1000.
   - Calculate \( \sqrt{1000} \).

2. **Estimate \(\sqrt{1000}\).**

Find the nearest perfect square greater than 5000.

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the smallest perfect square that is greater than the number 5000. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer.

1. **Estimate the approximate range**:
   - Since 5000 is not a very large number, let's start by finding the square root of 5000 to approximate the integer values we should consider.
   - The square root of 5000 is approximately \( \sqrt{5000} \approx 70.71 \).

2. **Identify the closest integer greater than the square root**:
   - Since we are looking for a perfect square that is greater than 5000, we take the ceiling of the square root of 5000.
   - The ceiling value of \( 70.71 \) is 71.

3. **Calculate the perfect square**:
   - The next step is to calculate \( 71^2 = 71 \times 71 \).
   - Let's do the multiplication:

Three positive numbers have the following properties: the product of the first and second numbers is 24; the product of the second and third numbers is 48; and the product of the first and third numbers is 32. We need to determine the smallest of these numbers.

### Solution

Let's denote the three positive numbers as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). According to the problem, we have:

1. \( a \times b = 24 \)
2. \( b \times c = 48 \)
3. \( a \times c = 32 \)

We need to find the smallest of these numbers.

#### Step 1: Multiply all three equations.

Multiply the three equations together:

\[ 
(a \times b) \times (b \times c) \times (a \times c) = 24 \times 48 \times 32 
\]

This simplifies to:

\[ 
a^2 \times b^2 \times c^2 = 24 \times 48 \times 32
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ 
a \times b \times c = \sqrt{24 \times 48 \times 32}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate \( a \times b \times c \).

First, compute \( 24 \times 48 \times 32 \):

- Calculate \( 24 \times 48 \):

\[ 24 \times 48 = 1152 \]

- Now, calculate \( 1152 \times 32 \):

\[ 1152 \times 32 = 36864 \]

Take the square root of 36864:

\[ 
a \times b \times c = \sqrt{36864} = 192
\]

#### Step 3: Determine each variable.

Using the value of \( a \times b \times c = 192 \):

1. Solve for \( c \):

\[ 
c = \frac{a \times b \times c}{a \times b} = \frac{192}{24} = 8
\]

2. Solve for \( a \):

\[ 
a = \frac{a \times b \times c}{b \times c} = \frac{192}{48} = 4
\]

3. Solve for \( b \):

Two positive numbers have a product of 162 and a quotient of 2; what are the numbers? Calculate the smaller number.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x > y \).

1. **Given Equations:**
   - The product of the numbers:  
     \[
     x \times y = 162
     \]
   - The quotient of the numbers:  
     \[
     \frac{x}{y} = 2
     \]

2. **Express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):**

   From the quotient, \( \frac{x}{y} = 2 \), we derive:  
   \[
   x = 2y
   \]

3. **Substitute \( x = 2y \) in the product equation:**

   \[
   (2y) \times y = 162
   \]

   Simplifying, we have:  
   \[
   2y^2 = 162
   \]

4. **Solve for \( y \):**

   Divide both sides of the equation by 2:  
   \[
   y^2 = 81
   \]

   Taking the square root of both sides gives:  
   \[
   y = \sqrt{81} = 9
   \]

5. **Find \( x \):**

   Substitute \( y = 9 \) back into the equation \( x = 2y \):  
   \[
   x = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Thus, the two numbers are 18 and 9. The smaller number is \( y = 9 \).

A small box has a length of 15 cm 2.4 mm, a width of 7 cm 6.2 mm, and a height of 5 cm 8 mm. What is the volume of the box in cubic centimeters?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the volume of the box in cubic centimeters, we first need to convert all the dimensions from centimeters and millimeters to only centimeters. This is because the volume will be calculated using these consistent units.

1. **Convert Dimensions to Centimeters:**

   - **Length:** 
     - 15 cm 2.4 mm is equivalent to 15 cm + (2.4 mm in cm).
     - Since 1 cm = 10 mm, 2.4 mm = 2.4 / 10 = 0.24 cm.
     - Therefore, the length is 15 + 0.24 = 15.24 cm.

   - **Width:**
     - 7 cm 6.2 mm is equivalent to 7 cm + (6.2 mm in cm).
     - 6.2 mm = 6.2 / 10 = 0.62 cm.
     - Therefore, the width is 7 + 0.62 = 7.62 cm.

   - **Height:**
     - 5 cm 8 mm is equivalent to 5 cm + (8 mm in cm).
     - 8 mm = 8 / 10 = 0.8 cm.
     - Therefore, the height is 5 + 0.8 = 5.8 cm.

2. **Calculate the Volume:**

   The volume \( V \) of a rectangular box is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
   \]

   Substituting the dimensions in centimeters:
   \[
   V = 15.24 \, \text{cm} \times 7.62 \, \text{cm} \times 5.8 \, \text{cm}
   \]

3. **Perform the Multiplication:**

   \[
   V = 15.24 \times 7.62 = 116.1288
   \]
   \[
   V = 116.1288 \times 5.8 = 673.54704 \, \text{cubic centimeters}

A merchant sells 18 kg 300 grams of rice and 5 kg 750 grams of salt in one day. Based on this, how much salt does he sell in a month?

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Understand the problem**: We need to determine the amount of salt the merchant sells in one month, given that he sells 5 kg 750 grams of salt in one day.

2. **Daily salt sales**:
   - The merchant sells \(5 \text{ kg } 750 \text{ grams}\) of salt in one day.
   - Convert 5 kg 750 grams to grams for easier calculation:
     \[
     5 \text{ kg } = 5 \times 1000 \text{ grams} = 5000 \text{ grams}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total salt in grams per day} = 5000 \text{ grams} + 750 \text{ grams} = 5750 \text{ grams}
     \]

3. **Monthly salt sales**:
   - Assume 30 days in a month.
   - Multiply the daily salt sales by the number of days in a month to get the monthly total:

A stick has \(\frac{1}{2}\) of its length in the ground, \(\frac{1}{3}\) of its length in the water, and the remaining part above the water. The length of the part above the water is 3 meters. How many meters of the stick are in the ground?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote the total length of the stick as \( L \).

According to the problem:
- \(\frac{1}{2}L\) is in the ground.
- \(\frac{1}{3}L\) is in the water.
- The remaining part, above the water, is 3 meters.

First, let's express mathematically the portion of the stick above the water:
- Portion above the water is \( L - \left(\frac{1}{2}L + \frac{1}{3}L\right) = 3\).

Combine the lengths in the ground and in the water:
\[ \frac{1}{2}L + \frac{1}{3}L \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6.

Convert \(\frac{1}{2}L\) and \(\frac{1}{3}L\) to have a denominator of 6:
\[ \frac{1}{2}L = \frac{3}{6}L \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}L = \frac{2}{6}L \]

Add these fractions:
\[ \frac{3}{6}L + \frac{2}{6}L = \frac{5}{6}L \]

Thus, the portion of the stick that is either in the ground or in the water is \(\frac{5}{6}L\).

Now, the part above the water is:
\[ L - \frac{5}{6}L = \frac{1}{6}L \]

According to the problem, this part is 3 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{6}L = 3 \]

To find \( L \), multiply both sides by 6:
\[ L = 18 \]

Now that we know the total length of the stick is 18 meters, let's find how much of it is in the ground:
\[ \frac{1}{2}L = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 ="

360 bighas of land require 4 tractors to be cultivated in 20 days. Calculate how many tractors are needed to cultivate 1800 bighas of land in 10 days.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we must understand the relationship between the number of bighas to be cultivated, the number of tractors used, and the number of days required.

### Step 1: Establish the initial workload capacity

From the problem, 4 tractors can cultivate 360 bighas in 20 days. Let's calculate the work done per tractor per day:

1. Total work done to cultivate 360 bighas in 20 days is:  
   \[
   360 \text{ bighas} (total work)
   \]

2. The total work done is shared among 4 tractors in 20 days. First, calculate the total work done by a single tractor in these 20 days:
   \[
   \text{Work per tractor for 20 days} = \frac{360}{4} = 90 \text{ bighas}
   \]

3. Therefore, the work done by one tractor in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Work per tractor per day} = \frac{90}{20} = 4.5 \text{ bighas}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the required work rate for 1800 bighas in 10 days

1. We need to cultivate 1800 bighas of land in 10 days. So, the total work required per day is:
   \[
   \text{Work required per day} = \frac{1800}{10} = 180 \text{ bighas}
   \]

2. We know from step 1 that one tractor can cover 4.5 bighas in one day. To find out how many tractors are needed to accomplish 180 bighas per day, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Number of tractors} = \frac{180}{4.5}
   \]

3. Solving for the number of tractors, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of tractors} = \frac{180}{4.5} = 40
   \]

### Conclusion

To cultivate 1800 bighas of land in 10 days, 40 tractors are needed.

   - We are given that 40 workers can complete the embankment in 35 days. We need to find the number of workers needed to do the same work in just 28 days.

2. **Calculate total work in worker-days:**
   - Total work, in terms of worker-days, is the product of the number of workers and the number of days they work.
   - \( \text{Total Work} = 40 \text{ workers} \times 35 \text{ days} = 1400 \text{ worker-days} \).

3. **Set up an equation for the number of workers needed in 28 days:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of workers needed to complete the job in 28 days.
   - The total work output needs to be the same, so:
   \[
   x \text{ workers} \times 28 \text{ days} = 1400 \text{ worker-days}
   \]

4. **Solve for x:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1400}{28}
   \]
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

5. **Conclude with the answer:**
   - Therefore, to finish the embankment work in 28 days, 50 workers are needed.

""What is the smallest number that can be subtracted from 9585 so that the result is a perfect square?""

## Step-by-Step Solution:

We need to find the smallest number \( x \) such that \( 9585 - x \) is a perfect square.

1. **Approximate the Square Root:**
   Begin by estimating the square root of 9585 to find the nearest perfect square. Calculate the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{9585} \approx 97.88
   \]
   The nearest integers are 97 and 98.

2. **Calculate Perfect Squares:**
   Let's calculate the squares of these integers:
   \[
   97^2 = 9409
   \]
   \[
   98^2 = 9604
   \]

3. **Determine Nearest Perfect Square:**
   We compare 9585 with these perfect squares:
   - \( 97^2 \) is 9409, which is less than 9585.
   - \( 98^2 \) is 9604, which is greater than 9585.

4. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - Difference for \( 97^2 \): 
     \[
     9585 - 9409 = 176
     \]
   - Difference for \( 98^2 \): 
     \[
     9604 - 9585 = 19
     \]

5. **Choosing the Smallest Difference:**
   To ensure that the resulting number is a perfect square by subtracting, we pick the smallest positive difference.
   
   Since we are subtracting to reach a lower perfect square:
   \[
   \text{Subtract } x = 176
   \]
   This is because subtracting 176 will make 9585 a perfect square (specifically, \(97^2\)).

## Conclusion:

By subtracting 176 from 9585, the result is a perfect square (\(97^2 = 9409\)). Thus, the smallest number that must be subtracted is:

A rectangular container (or tank) with a length of 3 meters, width of 2 meters, and height of 1 meter has a solid metal cube with a side length of 50 cm placed inside it. After filling the container with water and then removing the cube, what will be the depth of the water?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert Measurements to Consistent Units:**
   - The side length of the metal cube is given as 50 cm, which is equivalent to 0.5 meters since 1 meter = 100 cm.

2. **Calculate the Volume of the Metal Cube:**
   According to the formula for the volume of a cube, \( V = \text{side}^3 \).
   
   \[
   V = (0.5 \text{ m})^3 = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.125 \text{ cubic meters}

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   Let's break down the problem into steps:

   - First, calculate three times \( \frac{6}{7} \):
     \[
     3 \times \frac{6}{7} = \frac{3 \times 6}{7} = \frac{18}{7}
     \]
     Here, multiplying the numerator by 3 gives us \( \frac{18}{7} \).

   - Let the number to be added be \( x \). So, we need to find \( x \) such that:
     \[
     \frac{18}{7} + x = \frac{26}{7}
     \]

   - To find \( x \), subtract \( \frac{18}{7} \) from \( \frac{26}{7} \):
     \[
     x = \frac{26}{7} - \frac{18}{7}
     \]

   - Since the denominators are the same, subtract the numerators:
     \[
     x = \frac{26 - 18}{7} = \frac{8}{7}
     \]

   Thus, the number that should be added is \( \frac{8}{7} \).

The sum of two numbers is 55, and five times the larger number is equal to six times the smaller number. Find the larger number.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the larger number.
- \( y \) as the smaller number.

According to the problem, we have two main conditions:

1. The sum of the two numbers is 55.
   \[
   x + y = 55
   \]

2. Five times the larger number is equal to six times the smaller number.
   \[
   5x = 6y
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad x + y = 55 \\
2. & \quad 5x = 6y
\end{align*}
\]

From equation 2, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = \frac{5}{6}x
\]

Substitute \( y = \frac{5}{6}x \) into equation 1:
\[
x + \frac{5}{6}x = 55
\]

By combining like terms, we get:
\[
\left(1 + \frac{5}{6}\right)x = 55
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{6}{6}x + \frac{5}{6}x = 55
\]

\[
\frac{11}{6}x = 55
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{11}{6}\):
\[
x = 55 \times \frac{6}{11}
\]

\[
x = 5 \times 6
\]

\[
x = 30
\]

Thus, the larger number \( x \) is 30.

The sum of two numbers is 100 and their difference is 20. Determine the smaller number.

## 2. Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we can set up two equations based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the larger number and \( y \) be the smaller number.
   
From the problem, we have:
1. \( x + y = 100 \)  (Equation 1: The sum of the two numbers is 100)
2. \( x - y = 20 \)  (Equation 2: The difference between the two numbers is 20)

We can solve these equations using the method of addition or elimination to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Solve for \( x \)

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:
\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 100 + 20
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
2x = 120
\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
\[
x = 60
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( y \)

Now, substitute \( x = 60 \) back into Equation 1:
\[
60 + y = 100
\]
Subtract 60 from both sides to solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 100 - 60 = 40
\]

Therefore, the smaller number is 40.

In a garden, when 1,800 saplings were planted in a square, there were 36 saplings extra. Determine the number of saplings in each row.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve the problem, we need to find out how many saplings should be planted in each row such that they form a perfect square, given that planting 1,800 saplings results in 36 extra.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have 1,800 saplings.
   - When these are attempted to be arranged in a perfect square layout, there are 36 saplings leftover.

2. **Formulating the Equation:**
   - If we assume that the garden should be arranged in a perfect square and let the length of each side (number of saplings per row or column) be \( n \), then the total number of saplings in a perfect square would be \( n^2 \).
   - The problem states that when 1,800 saplings were used, there were 36 extra. Therefore, the equation can be set up as:
     \[
     n^2 + 36 = 1800
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to find \( n^2 \):
     \[
     n^2 = 1800 - 36
     \]
     \[
     n^2 = 1764
     \]
   - To find \( n \), take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     n = \sqrt{1764}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Square Root:**
   - Calculate the square root of 1,764:
     \[
     n = 42
     \]

5. **Concluding the Solution:**
   - The number of saplings in each row is 42.

Thus, the number of saplings that should be planted in each row to form a perfect square arrangement is **42**.

Gita, Rita, and Mita together have 180 taka. Gita has 6 taka less than Rita, and Mita has 12 taka more than Gita. How much money does Mita have?

### Solution

Let's denote the amount of money Rita has as \( R \) taka.

- According to the problem, Gita has 6 taka less than Rita. Therefore, the amount of money Gita has is:
  \[
  G = R - 6
  \]

- Mita has 12 taka more than Gita. Thus, the amount of money Mita has is:
  \[
  M = G + 12 = (R - 6) + 12 = R + 6
  \]

The total amount of money combined for Gita, Rita, and Mita is given as 180 taka. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
G + R + M = 180
\]

Substitute the expressions for \( G \) and \( M \) in terms of \( R \):
\[
(R - 6) + R + (R + 6) = 180
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
R - 6 + R + R + 6 = 180
\]
\[
3R = 180
\]

Solve for \( R \):
\[
R = \frac{180}{3} = 60
\]

Now that we have Rita's amount (\( R \)), we can find out how much Mita has:
\[
M = R + 6 = 60 + 6 = 66
\]

### Conclusion

The amount of money Mita has is **66 taka**.

The problem in Bengali is asking:
""How many leap years have there been from the time India gained independence up to the year 2014?""

## Solution
India gained independence on August 15, 1947. The task is to calculate the number of leap years from 1948 to 2014, as 1948 would be the first full year after independence.

A year is considered a leap year if:
1. It is divisible by 4.
2. However, if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the range of years**:
   - Start year: 1948
   - End year: 2014

2. **Find the leap years**:
   - A leap year is every 4 years. We calculate the number of leap years from 1948 to 2014 using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of leap years} = \left\lfloor \frac{{\text{End year}}}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{{\text{Start year}-1}}{4} \right\rfloor
   \]
   - Apply the formula to both limits:
     - For 2014: \(\left\lfloor \frac{2014}{4} \right\rfloor = 503\)
     - For 1947: \(\left\lfloor \frac{1947}{4} \right\rfloor = 486\)

3. **Calculate the total number of leap years**:
   \[
   503 - 486 = 17
   \]

Thus, there have been 17 leap years from 1948 to 2014 inclusive.

A water tank receives 5 liters of water per minute and 2 liters of water is consumed every minute. How much water will be in the water tank after 10 minutes?

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Determine the net amount of water added per minute:**
   - Water coming into the tank per minute = 5 liters.
   - Water being consumed per minute = 2 liters.
   - The net addition of water per minute to the tank is given by:
     \[
     \text{Net water per minute} = \text{water in} - \text{water out} = 5 \, \text{liters} - 2 \, \text{liters} = 3 \, \text{liters per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water added in 10 minutes:**
   - Since the net amount of water added each minute is 3 liters, in 10 minutes the total amount of water added can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total water in 10 minutes} = 3 \, \text{liters/minute} \times 10 \, \text{minutes} = 30 \, \text{liters}
     \]

3. **Conclude with the final amount of water in the tank:**
   - Assuming the tank was initially empty, after 10 minutes with the net addition of 3 liters per minute, the tank will contain:
     \[
     \text{Total water in tank} = 30 \, \text{liters}
     \]

Hence, the amount of water in the tank after 10 minutes is **30 liters**.

A fish seller buys each set of four hilsa fish (hāli) for 1600 Taka and sells each fish for 350 Taka. What is his percentage of profit or loss?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Purchase Cost**:
    - The seller buys a set of 4 hilsa fish (hāli) for 1600 Taka.
    - Therefore, the cost for each fish is calculated by dividing the total cost for the set by the number of fish in a set:
    
    \[
    \text{Cost per fish} = \frac{1600\ \text{Taka}}{4} = 400\ \text{Taka}
    \]

2. **Determining the Selling Price**:
    - The selling price of each fish is given as 350 Taka.

3. **Calculate the Profit or Loss per Fish**:
    - Since the cost price per fish is 400 Taka and the selling price is 350 Taka, the profit or loss per fish is:
    
    \[
    \text{Loss per fish} = \text{Cost Price} - \text{Selling Price} = 400\ \text{Taka} - 350\ \text{Taka} = 50\ \text{Taka}
    \]

4. **Determine if It Is a Profit or Loss**:
    - The result is a positive value, which means it indicates a loss of 50 Taka per fish.

5. **Calculate the Percentage of Loss**:
    - The percentage of loss is calculated by taking the loss per fish divided by the cost price per fish, and then multiplying it by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
    
    \[
    \text{Percentage Loss} = \left(\frac{50}{400}\right) \times 100 = 12.5\%

The problem states: ""Try to divide 210 takas between Fatema and Shakil in the ratio of 3:4. Calculate how much money should be given to Fatema.""

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Ratio**:
   - We are given the ratio in which the total amount should be divided: 3:4. This means for every 3 parts that Fatema receives, Shakil receives 4 parts.

2. **Total Parts Calculation**:
   - To find the total number of parts into which the money is divided, we sum the parts of Fatema and Shakil: 
     \[
     3 + 4 = 7 \text{ parts}
     \]

3. **Value of Each Part**:
   - The total amount of money to be divided is 210 takas. To find the value of each part, divide the total amount by the number of parts:
     \[
     \text{Value of one part} = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \text{ takas}
     \]

4. **Calculating Fatema's Share**:
   - Fatema's share corresponds to 3 parts. Therefore, to find how much money Fatema will get, multiply the number of parts she receives by the value of each part:
     \[
     \text{Fatema's share} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ takas}
     \]

5. **Verification**:
   - Just to verify, Shakil would receive \(4 \times 30 = 120\) takas.
   - Sum of Fatema's and Shakil's shares: \(90 + 120 = 210\) takas, which matches the total amount.

Hence, the amount of money Fatema should receive is:

A principal amount results in an amount of 1578 Taka with interest in 3 years and an amount of 1830 Taka with interest in 5 years. Determine the principal amount.

### Solution in English:

To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of simple interest, which allows us to establish a relationship between the principal, the interest earned, and the time period.

**Step 1:** Define the variables:
- Let \( P \) be the principal amount.
- Let \( R \) be the rate of interest per annum.
- The amount after 3 years is 1578 Taka.
- The amount after 5 years is 1830 Taka.

**Step 2:** Establish equations:
Using the formula for simple interest, \( A = P + \frac{P \cdot R \cdot T}{100} \), where \( A \) is the amount, \( P \) is the principal, \( R \) is the rate of interest, and \( T \) is the time period in years.

For 3 years:
\[ A_3 = P + \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 3}{100} = 1578 \]

For 5 years:
\[ A_5 = P + \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 5}{100} = 1830 \]

**Step 3:** Derive equations for interest over the periods:
Subtract the two equations to eliminate \( P \):
\[ (P + \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 5}{100}) - (P + \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 3}{100}) = 1830 - 1578 \]

\[ \Rightarrow \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 5}{100} - \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 3}{100} = 252 \]

Thus, the interest for 2 years:
\[ \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 2}{100} = 252 \]

**Step 4:** Solve for \( P \cdot R \):
\[ P \cdot R \cdot 2 = 252 \times 100 \]
\[ P \cdot R = \frac{252 \times 100}{2} = 12600 \]

Now use one of the earlier equations to solve for \( P \). Using the"

35.28 liters of oil is to be equally divided among 9 families. How many liters of oil will each family receive?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of oil by the number of families to find out how much oil each family will receive.

### Step 1: Understand the Total Quantity and the Division
- Total oil available: 35.28 liters.
- Number of families: 9.

### Step 2: Perform the Division
We need to divide 35.28 liters by 9 to determine the amount each family receives.

\[
\frac{35.28}{9}
\]

### Step 3: Execute the Division
Let's divide 35.28 by 9.

1. **Divide**: 35 divided by 9 gives 3, because 9 x 3 = 27.
   - **Remainder**: 35 - 27 = 8.

2. **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the digit 2 from 35.28, making it 82.

3. **Divide 82 by 9**: 82 divided by 9 gives 9, because 9 x 9 = 81.
   - **Remainder**: 82 - 81 = 1.

4. **Bring down the next digit**: Bring down the digit 8, making it 18.

5. **Divide 18 by 9**: 18 divided by 9 gives 2, because 9 x 2 = 18.
   - **Remainder**: 18 - 18 = 0.

So, by dividing 35.28 by 9, we find that each family receives 3.92 liters of oil.

A wholesale seller makes a 20% profit, and a retail seller also makes a 20% profit on selling a product. If the retail selling price of the product is 576 taka, what is the purchase price for the wholesale seller?

### Detailed Solution

Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Determine the Relationship of Prices:**
   - Let \( W \) be the wholesale purchase price.
   - The wholesale seller sells the product at a 20% profit, which means the selling price for the wholesale seller is \( 1.20 \times W \).
   - The retail seller buys at this price and sells at a 20% profit over their purchase price. The given retail selling price is 576 taka.

2. **Establish the Equation for Retail Price:**
   - The retail seller's cost price is the wholesale selling price, which is \( 1.20 \times W \).
   - Selling at a 20% profit implies the retail selling price is:
     \[
     1.20 \times (1.20 \times W) = 576
     \]

3. **Solve for \( W \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     1.20 \times 1.20 \times W = 576
     \]
     \[
     1.44 \times W = 576
     \]

   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{576}{1.44}
     \]

   - Calculation:
     \[
     W = 400
     \]

Therefore, the purchase price for the wholesale seller is 400 taka.

Two positive numbers have a product of 147; the larger number is 3 times the smaller number. What is the larger number?

### Solution:

Let's denote the smaller number as \( x \).

According to the problem, the larger number is 3 times the smaller number. So, we can represent the larger number as \( 3x \).

The product of these two numbers is given as 147. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x \times 3x = 147
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x^2 = 147
\]

To isolate \( x^2 \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
x^2 = \frac{147}{3}
\]

Calculating the division:

\[
x^2 = 49
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by taking the square root of both sides:

\[
x = \sqrt{49}
\]

\[
x = 7
\]

Thus, the smaller number is 7. Since the larger number is 3 times the smaller number:

\[
\text{Larger number} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

### Conclusion:
The larger number is 21.

Puja took out a loan from the bank at an annual interest rate of 12% and paid an interest of 1680 rupees after one year. What was the principal amount?

## Step-by-Step Solution

To find the principal amount that Puja borrowed, we can use the formula for simple interest, which is given by:

\[
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount,
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
- \( T \) is the time (in years).

From the problem statement:
- The simple interest (\( SI \)) is 1680 rupees,
- The annual interest rate (\( R \)) is 12%,
- The time (\( T \)) is 1 year.

Substituting these values into the simple interest formula, we have:

\[
1680 = \frac{P \times 12 \times 1}{100}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we have:

\[
1680 = \frac{12P}{100}
\]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \):

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
1680 \times 100 = 12P
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
168000 = 12P
\]

Now, divide both sides by 12 to solve for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{168000}{12}
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
P = 14000
\]

## Conclusion
The principal amount that Puja borrowed from the bank is 14,000 rupees.

The sum of two numbers is 55. The greater number multiplied by 5 is equal to the smaller number multiplied by 6. Find the smaller number.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote the two numbers as \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \) is the smaller number and \( y \) is the larger number.

We are given two conditions:

1. The sum of the two numbers is 55:
   \[
   x + y = 55
   \]

2. The larger number multiplied by 5 is equal to the smaller number multiplied by 6:
   \[
   5y = 6x
   \]

### Solving the System of Equations:

First, we will solve the second equation for \( y \):

\[
5y = 6x \implies y = \frac{6x}{5}
\]

Next, we will substitute this expression for \( y \) into the first equation:

\[
x + \frac{6x}{5} = 55
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first find a common denominator for the terms on the left:

\[
\frac{5x}{5} + \frac{6x}{5} = \frac{5x + 6x}{5} = \frac{11x}{5} = 55
\]

Now, multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
11x = 275
\]

Divide both sides by 11 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{275}{11} = 25
\]

### Verification:

Now that we have determined the smaller number \( x = 25 \), let's find \( y \) using the relationship \( y = 55 - x \):

\[
y = 55 - 25 = 30
\]

Check the second condition: \( 5y = 6x \)

\[
5 \times 30 = 150 \quad \text{and} \quad 6 \times 25 = 150
\]

Both sides are equal, verifying our solution satisfies all given conditions.

Monowara Begum borrowed some money at a 6% interest rate and some money at a 4% interest rate for her family needs. She borrowed a total of 56,000 Taka and paid 2,840 Taka as interest. If a 5% interest rate was applicable to the entire loan, what would be the annual interest?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let the amount of money borrowed at 6% interest be \( x \).
   - Let the amount of money borrowed at 4% interest be \( y \).

2. **Establish the Equations:**
   - Given the total amount borrowed is 56,000 Taka:
     \[
     x + y = 56,000
     \]

   - The total interest paid, 2,840 Taka, was calculated as follows:
     \[
     0.06x + 0.04y = 2,840
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - To solve this system, let's use the equation \( x + y = 56,000 \) to express one variable in terms of the other. For instance:
     \[
     y = 56,000 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 56,000 - x \) into the interest equation:
     \[
     0.06x + 0.04(56,000 - x) = 2,840
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     0.06x + 2,240 - 0.04x = 2,840
     \]

     \[
     0.02x = 600
     \]

     \[
     x = 30,000
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 30,000 \) back into \( y = 56,000 - x \):
     \[
     y = 56,000 - 30,000 = 26,000
     \]

4. **Calculate the Interest with a 5% Rate on Total Loan:**
   - If the entire loan of 56,000 Taka were subject to a 5% interest rate, the interest would be:
     \[
     \text{Interest} = \frac{5}{100} \times 56,000 ="

   The product of two numbers is 15,050,490; if one number is 5, what is the other number?

2. **Step-by-step Solution and Explanation**:

   To find the unknown number, we have a known product of two numbers and one known number. The relationship between these is given by the equation:
   
   \[
   \text{Product} = \text{Number}_1 \times \text{Number}_2
   \]

   Here, \(\text{Product} = 15,050,490\) and \(\text{Number}_1 = 5\). We need to find \(\text{Number}_2\).
   
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(\text{Number}_2\):

   \[
   \text{Number}_2 = \frac{\text{Product}}{\text{Number}_1}
   \]

   Substitute the known values into the equation:

   \[
   \text{Number}_2 = \frac{15,050,490}{5}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:

   Divide 15,050,490 by 5:
   
   1. Divide the first digit: \(15 \div 5 = 3\)
   2. Bring down the next digit: \(0\); 0 divided by 5 is 0.
   3. Bring down the next digit: \(5\); \(5 \div 5 = 1\).
   4. Bring down the next digit: \(0\); 0 divided by 5 is 0.
   5. Bring down the next digit: \(4\); \(4 \div 5 = 0\) and bring down the next digit: \(9\); \(49 \div 5 = 9\) remainder 4.
   6. Finally bring down the last digit: \(0\); \(40 \div 5 = 8\).

   Therefore, \(\text{Number}_2 = 3,010,098\).

   Sajjad Saheb had 24,000 taka. He donated 5/12 of this amount to an orphanage, and 3/8 of this amount to an educational institution. How much money does he have left?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   First, calculate the amount donated to the orphanage:
   - Total money = 24,000 taka
   - Fraction donated to the orphanage = 5/12

   Amount donated to the orphanage = \( \frac{5}{12} \times 24,000 \)

   \[
   = \frac{5 \times 24,000}{12} 
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{120,000}{12}
   \]

   \[
   = 10,000 \text{ taka}
   \]

   Next, calculate the amount donated to the educational institution:
   - Fraction donated to the educational institution = 3/8

   Amount donated to the educational institution = \( \frac{3}{8} \times 24,000 \)

   \[
   = \frac{3 \times 24,000}{8}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{72,000}{8}
   \]

   \[
   = 9,000 \text{ taka}
   \]

   Now, find the total amount donated:
   \[
   \text{Total donation} = 10,000 + 9,000 = 19,000 \text{ taka}
   \]

   Finally, calculate the amount of money remaining:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 24,000 - 19,000 = 5,000 \text{ taka}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   The amount of money Sajjad Saheb has left after his donations is **5,000** taka.

A train that is 120 meters long is going to cross a bridge that is 330 meters long. If the train is moving at a speed of 30 km/h, how much time (in seconds) will it take for the train to cross the bridge?

## Solution:

To determine the time it takes for the train to completely cross the bridge, we need to consider the total distance that needs to be covered for the entire train to clear the bridge. This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Distance
- Length of the train = 120 meters
- Length of the bridge = 330 meters

Total distance to be covered = 120 meters (train) + 330 meters (bridge) = 450 meters

### Step 2: Convert Train's Speed from km/h to m/s
The train's speed is given as 30 km/h. To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor:
\[ 1 \text{ km/h} = \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} \]

Converting 30 km/h to m/s:
\[ 30 \text{ km/h} = 30 \times \frac{1000}{3600} \text{ m/s} \]
\[ 30 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = \frac{30000}{3600} = \frac{25}{3} \text{ m/s} \approx 8.33 \text{ m/s}\]

### Step 3: Calculate Time to Cross the Bridge
Using the formula for time, where time is the total distance divided by speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the total distance and speed into the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{450 \text{ meters}}{8.33 \text{ m/s}} \]
\[ \text{Time} \approx 54 \text{ seconds}\]

Thus, it will take the train approximately 54 seconds to cross the bridge.

The current population of a city is 6.4 million. If the population growth rate is 25 people per thousand, what will be the population of the city after 2 years?

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of exponential growth. The formula for population growth is:

\[ 
P(t) = P_0 \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{1000}\right)^t 
\]

where:
- \( P(t) \) is the population after time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial population,
- \( r \) is the growth rate per thousand,
- \( t \) is the time period in years.

In this problem:
- The initial population \( P_0 = 6.4 \) million = 6,400,000,
- The growth rate \( r = 25 \),
- The time period \( t = 2 \) years.

Let's plug these values into the formula:

1. Convert the current population to a number: \( P_0 = 6,400,000 \).
2. Use the growth rate per thousand formula: \( 1 + \frac{25}{1000} = 1 + 0.025 = 1.025 \).

Calculate the population after 2 years:

\[
P(2) = 6,400,000 \times (1.025)^2
\]

First, calculate \( (1.025)^2 \):

\[
(1.025)^2 = 1.025 \times 1.025 = 1.050625
\]

Now calculate the population after 2 years:

\[
P(2) = 6,400,000 \times 1.050625 = 6,723,983.2
\]

Since population count should be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number:

\[
P(2) \approx 6,723,983
\]

The estimated population of the city after 2 years will be approximately 6,723,983.

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the given proportions:**
   - From the problem, it is given that 1 deciliter of paint can paint \( \frac{3}{4} \) square meters.

2. **Determine the painting capacity per deciliter:**
   - Since 1 deciliter covers \( \frac{3}{4} \) square meters, we need to find the amount in terms of how much 1 deciliter covers. This can be represented by the equation:
     \[
     \text{Area per deciliter} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ square meters}
     \]

3. **Finding how many square meters can be painted with 4 deciliters:**
   - If 1 deciliter covers \( \frac{3}{4} \) square meters, then 4 deciliters will cover 4 times that area. We calculate the total area \( A \) that can be painted by multiplying \( \frac{3}{4} \) square meters per deciliter by 4 deciliters:
     \[
     A = 4 \times \frac{3}{4}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     A = \frac{4 \times 3}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]

What is the greatest number that can divide 306, 810, and 2214 without leaving any remainder?

### Solution:
To find the greatest number that divides all three numbers (306, 810, and 2214) without leaving a remainder, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these numbers.

#### Step 1: Find the prime factorization of each number.
- **306**: 
  - Divide by 2 (smallest prime number): \(306 \div 2 = 153\)
  - Divide by 3: \(153 \div 3 = 51\)
  - Divide by 3 again: \(51 \div 3 = 17\) (17 is a prime number)
  - Prime factorization of 306: \(2 \times 3^2 \times 17\)

- **810**: 
  - Divide by 2: \(810 \div 2 = 405\)
  - Divide by 3: \(405 \div 3 = 135\)
  - Divide by 3 again: \(135 \div 3 = 45\)
  - Divide by 3 again: \(45 \div 3 = 15\)
  - Divide by 3 once more: \(15 \div 3 = 5\) (5 is a prime number)
  - Prime factorization of 810: \(2 \times 3^4 \times 5\)

- **2214**:
  - Divide by 2: \(2214 \div 2 = 1107\)
  - Divide by 3: \(1107 \div 3 = 369\)
  - Divide by 3 again: \(369 \div 3 = 123\)
  - Divide by 3 again: \(123 \div 3 = 41\) (41 is a prime number)
  - Prime factorization of 2214: \(2 \times 3^3 \times 41\)

#### Step 2: Identify the common factors.
From the prime factorizations:
- **306**: \(2 \times 3^2 \times 17\)
- **810**: \(2 \times 3^4 \times 5\)
- **2214**: \(2 \times 3^3 \times 41\)

From half of 150 taka, how much taka should be removed to leave 30 taka remaining?

## Solution:

1. **Calculate Half of 150 Taka:**

   To find half of 150 taka, we need to divide 150 by 2.
   
   \[
   \frac{150}{2} = 75
   \]

   So, half of 150 taka is 75 taka.

2. **Determine the Amount to be Removed:**

   We know that after removing a certain amount from 75 taka, 30 taka should remain. Let's denote the amount to be removed as \( x \).

   The equation based on the problem is as follows:
   
   \[
   75 - x = 30
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**

   To find \( x \), solve the equation:

   \[
   75 - x = 30
   \]

   Subtract 30 from both sides:

   \[
   75 - 30 = x
   \]

   \[
   x = 45
   \]

   Therefore, 45 taka should be removed from 75 taka in order for 30 taka to remain.

## Conclusion:
The amount of money to be removed is 45 taka.

228 m, 342 m, 456 m. Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of these numbers.

## Step-by-step Solution:

To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 228, 342, and 456, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. We will apply it step-by-step to all the given numbers.

### Step 1: Finding the GCD of the first two numbers (228 and 342)

1. Divide 342 by 228 and find the remainder:
   \[
   342 \div 228 = 1 \quad \text{remainder: } 342 - 228 \times 1 = 114
   \]

2. Now, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 228 and the remainder 114:
   \[
   228 \div 114 = 2 \quad \text{remainder: } 228 - 114 \times 2 = 0
   \]

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD of 228 and 342 is 114.

### Step 2: Finding the GCD of the result from Step 1 with the next number (456)

1. Now, find the GCD of 114 and 456 using the same method:
   \[
   456 \div 114 = 4 \quad \text{remainder: } 456 - 114 \times 4 = 0
   \]

Translated into English, it reads: ""A ribbon that is 7 meters long is divided into 8 equal parts. Find the length of each part.""

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We have a ribbon that is 7 meters in length. We need to divide this ribbon into 8 equal parts, and we aim to calculate the length of each individual part.

2. **Formulating the Mathematical Expression:**
   When dividing a whole into equal parts, we use division. Here, we are dividing 7 meters into 8 parts. Therefore, the expression we need to evaluate is:
   
   \[
   \text{Length of each part} = \frac{7 \text{ meters}}{8}
   \]

3. **Performing the Division:**
   To find the length of each part, divide 7 by 8:

   \[
   7 \div 8 = 0.875
   \]

   This calculation tells us that the length of each divided part of the ribbon is 0.875 meters.

4. **Verification:**
   - If each of the 8 parts is 0.875 meters long, they should sum up back to the original length of the ribbon:
     \[
     8 \times 0.875 = 7 \text{ meters}
     \]

   This shows the division is correct as the total equals the original ribbon length.

The current population of a city is 26,250 people. If the population increases at an annual rate of 4%, what will the population be after two years?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine the future population after a certain period with a given annual growth rate, we utilize the formula for compound interest (or compound population growth in this context):

\[ P = P_0 (1 + r)^t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the future population,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial population,
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 26,250 \),
- \( r = 4\% = 0.04 \),
- \( t = 2 \) years.

Plugging the values into the formula, we calculate:

\[ P = 26,250 \times (1 + 0.04)^2 \]

\[ P = 26,250 \times (1.04)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (1.04)^2 \):

\[ (1.04)^2 = 1.04 \times 1.04 = 1.0816 \]

Now, substitute back to find \( P \):

\[ P = 26,250 \times 1.0816 \]

Calculate the multiplication:

\[ P \approx 28,398 \]

Thus, the population after two years, considering an annual growth rate of 4%, will be approximately 28,398 people.

A number is 9 less than twice another number, and their sum is 42. What is the larger number?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote the two numbers as \( x \) and \( y \). 

1. **Establishing Relationships:**
   - According to the problem, one number (\( x \)) is 9 less than twice another number (\( y \)). This gives us the equation:
     \[
     x = 2y - 9
     \]
   - It is also given that the sum of the two numbers is 42:
     \[
     x + y = 42
     \]

2. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - We can substitute the expression for \( x \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     (2y - 9) + y = 42
     \]
   - Simplify and combine like terms:
     \[
     2y - 9 + y = 42
     \]
     \[
     3y - 9 = 42
     \]
   - Add 9 to both sides to isolate terms involving \( y \):
     \[
     3y = 51
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 17
     \]

3. **Calculate \( x \):**
   - Now that we have \( y = 17 \), we can find \( x \) using the first equation:
     \[
     x = 2y - 9
     \]
     \[
     x = 2(17) - 9
     \]
     \[
     x = 34 - 9
     \]
     \[
     x = 25
     \]

4. **Verify:**
   - Let's verify the computations:
     - The sum of \( x \) and \( y \) should be 42:
       \[
       x + y = 25 + 17 = 42
       \]
     - \( x \) should be 9 less than twice \( y \):
       \[
       2 \times 17 - 9 = 34 - 9 = 25
       \]
   - Both conditions are satisfied.

Thus, the larger number is 25.

A square field has a side length of 300 meters, and there is a road 4 meters wide surrounding it on all four sides. What is the area of the road?

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the side length of the larger square that includes the road:**
   - The original square field has a side length of 300 meters.
   - Since the road surrounds the square field and is 4 meters wide on every side, we need to add twice the width of the road to the side of the square (one width on each side).
   - Therefore, the side length of the larger square including the road is: 
     \[
     300 \, \text{meters} + 2 \times 4 \, \text{meters} = 300 \, \text{meters} + 8 \, \text{meters} = 308 \, \text{meters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the area of the original square field:**
   - The area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{side length}^2 \).
   - For the original square:
     \[
     \text{Area of original square field} = 300^2 = 90000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of the larger square including the road:**
   - Using the side length of the larger square:
     \[
     \text{Area of larger square} = 308^2 = 94764 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the area of the road:**
   - The area of the road is the difference between the area of the larger square and the area of the original square field.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Area of the road} = 94764 \, \text{square meters} - 90000 \, \text{square meters} = 4764 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The area of the road surrounding the square field is **4764 square meters**.

Rajdeep's father sold 125 guavas from their guava garden at a price of 2 taka each in the Baruipur market. With the money he received, he bought 2 pens at a price of 5 taka each and 2 notebooks priced at 20 taka each. The remaining money was equally divided between his two siblings for sweets. How much money did Rajdeep receive?

## Solution:
1. **Calculate Total Revenue from Selling Guavas:**
   - Price per guava = 2 taka
   - Total number of guavas = 125
   - Total revenue = 125 guavas × 2 taka/guava = 250 taka

2. **Calculate Total Expenditure on Pens and Notebooks:**
   - Price per pen = 5 taka
   - Number of pens = 2
   - Total cost for pens = 2 pens × 5 taka/pen = 10 taka

   - Price per notebook = 20 taka
   - Number of notebooks = 2
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks × 20 taka/notebook = 40 taka

   - Total expenditure = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks = 10 taka + 40 taka = 50 taka

3. **Calculate Remaining Money:**
   - Remaining money after purchases = Total revenue - Total expenditure = 250 taka - 50 taka = 200 taka

4. **Divide the Remaining Money Equally:**
   - The remaining money is to be equally divided between Rajdeep and his sibling.
   - Number of siblings = 2
   - Amount each sibling receives = 200 taka ÷ 2 = 100 taka

Hence, Rajdeep received 100 taka.

Sabuj, Dalim, and Linkon are three brothers. Their father distributed 6300 Taka among them. Sabuj received 3/5 of what Dalim received, and Dalim received twice the amount that Linkon received. Find out how much money Dalim received.

### Solution
Let's denote the amount of money received by Linkon as \( L \).

According to the problem:
- Dalim receives twice the money Linkon receives, so Dalim receives \( 2L \).
- Sabuj receives \(\frac{3}{5}\) of what Dalim receives, so Sabuj receives \(\frac{3}{5} \times 2L = \frac{6}{5}L\).

Thus, the total amount of money distributed to all three brothers is:

\[ L + 2L + \frac{6}{5}L = 6300 \]

Combine the terms:

Calculate the sum:
\[ L + 2L = 3L \]
\[ 3L + \frac{6}{5}L = \frac{15}{5}L + \frac{6}{5}L = \frac{21}{5}L \]

Set up the equation:
\[ \frac{21}{5}L = 6300 \]

To solve for \( L \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 21L = 6300 \times 5 \]
\[ 21L = 31500 \]

Now, divide by 21:
\[ L = \frac{31500}{21} \]
\[ L = 1500 \]

Since Dalim receives \( 2L \), the amount Dalim receives is:

If the annual profit rate decreases from 10% to 8%, how much will the profit decrease for ₹3000 over 3 years?

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Initial Understanding**:
   - Initial interest rate: 10%
   - New interest rate: 8%
   - Principal amount: ₹3000
   - Time period: 3 years

2. **Calculate the Profit with Initial Rate (10%)**:
   - The formula for simple interest is \( \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100} \).
   - Using the initial rate of 10%, the simple interest for 3 years is:
     \[
     \text{Initial Interest} = \frac{3000 \times 10 \times 3}{100} = \frac{90000}{100} = ₹900
     \]

3. **Calculate the Profit with New Rate (8%)**:
   - Using the new rate of 8%, the simple interest for 3 years is:
     \[
     \text{New Interest} = \frac{3000 \times 8 \times 3}{100} = \frac{72000}{100} = ₹720
     \]

4. **Calculate the Decrease in Profit**:
   - The decrease in the profit due to the change in interest rate is the difference between the two interests calculated.
   - Decrease in Interest = Initial Interest - New Interest
     \[
     \text{Decrease in Interest} = ₹900 - ₹720 = ₹180

Find two pairs of numbers between 50 and 100 for which the greatest common divisor (GCD) is 16, and the sum of these numbers is 144. What is the larger number in one such pair?

## Detailed Solution:

To solve the problem, we're looking for pairs of numbers \((a, b)\) such that:

1. \( 50 < a < 100\) and \( 50 < b < 100\)
2. The GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is 16
3. The sum \(a + b = 144\)

Since the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is 16, both numbers must be multiples of 16: let \(a = 16m\) and \(b = 16n\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers.

### Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sum Condition:**
   \[
   a + b = 144 \implies 16m + 16n = 144 \implies m + n = 9
   \]
   Thus, \(m\) and \(n\) must be integers such that their sum equals 9.

2. **Multiples of 16 Condition:**
   Each number needs to be greater than 50 and less than 100:
   \[
   50 < 16m < 100 \quad \text{and} \quad 50 < 16n < 100
   \]
   - For \(16m > 50\), we have \(m > \frac{50}{16} \approx 3.125\). Thus, \(m \geq 4\).
   - For \(16m < 100\), we have \(m < \frac{100}{16} = 6.25\). Thus, \(m \leq 6\).

Combining these conditions for \(m\):
- Possible values for \(m\) are 4, 5, and 6.

Let's check these values:

1. **\(m = 4\), \(n = 5\) (since \(m + n = 9\)):**
   \[
   a = 16 \times 4 = 64, \quad b = 16 \times 5 = 80
   \]
   Both numbers are between 50 and 100,"

A room has 3 doors and 6 windows. Each door is 2 meters tall and 1.25 meters wide, and each window is 1.25 meters tall and 1 meter wide. How many planks, each 5 meters long and 0.60 meters wide, are needed to construct the doors and windows for this room?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Doors:**

   - Each door's area = height × width
   - Area of one door = 2 meters × 1.25 meters = 2.5 square meters
   - Since there are 3 doors, total area for doors = 3 × 2.5 = 7.5 square meters

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Windows:**

   - Each window's area = height × width
   - Area of one window = 1.25 meters × 1 meter = 1.25 square meters
   - Since there are 6 windows, total area for windows = 6 × 1.25 = 7.5 square meters

3. **Calculate the Total Area for Doors and Windows Combined:**

   - Total area for both doors and windows = Total area of doors + Total area of windows
   - Total area = 7.5 square meters (doors) + 7.5 square meters (windows) = 15 square meters

4. **Calculate the Area of One Plank:**

   - Each plank's area = length × width
   - Area of one plank = 5 meters × 0.60 meters = 3 square meters

5. **Calculate the Number of Planks Needed:**

   - To find the total number of planks needed, divide the total area needed for doors and windows by the area of one plank.
   - Number of planks needed = Total area for doors and windows / Area of one plank
   - Number of planks = 15 square meters / 3 square meters/plank = 5

At the same rate of interest, the compound capital of a principal amount is 6500 BDT (Bangladeshi Taka) after one year and 6570 BDT after two years. What is the principal amount?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:
\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount (compound capital) after \( n \) years,
- \( P \) is the principal amount,
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal), and
- \( n \) is the time (in years).

From the problem, we have:

- After 1 year, the amount \( A_1 = 6500 \).
- After 2 years, the amount \( A_2 = 6570 \).

### Step 1: Calculate the rate of interest

We start by forming the equation for each year:

1. After 1 year:
   \[ 6500 = P(1 + r) \]  (Equation 1)

2. After 2 years:
   \[ 6570 = P(1 + r)^2 \]  (Equation 2)

From Equation 1:
\[ P = \frac{6500}{1+r} \]

Substitute \( P \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ 6570 = \left(\frac{6500}{1+r}\right)(1+r)^2 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 6570 = 6500(1 + r) \]

From here, solving for \( 1 + r \):
\[ 6570/6500 = 1 + r \]

Calculating the above division:
\[ 1 + r = \frac{6570}{6500} = \frac{657}{650} \]

Thus:
\[ r = \frac{657}{650} - 1 = \frac{7}{650} \]

### Step 2: Verify and calculate principal amount

Now we substitute \( r = \frac{7}{650} \) back into Equation 1 to find \( P \):
\[ 6500 = P(1 + \frac{7}{650}) \]

\[ 6500 = P(\frac{657}{650}) \]

\[ P = \frac{6500 \times 650}{657} \]

Mr. Ramiz deposited 5000 Taka in a bank and decided that he will not withdraw any money for the next 6 years. If the annual interest rate is 10%, what will be the principal plus interest after 6 years?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the future value of the deposit using compound interest, as the interest is compounded annually.

### Step 1: Identify the Given Values
- Principal amount, \( P = 5000 \) Taka
- Annual interest rate, \( r = 10\% = 0.10 \)
- Time period, \( t = 6 \) years

### Step 2: Understand the Formula for Compound Interest
The formula for calculating the future value with compound interest is given by:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

In this problem, the interest is compounded annually, so \( n = 1 \).

Thus, the formula simplifies to:

\[
A = P (1 + r)^t
\]

### Step 3: Plug in the Values and Calculate

\[
A = 5000 \times (1 + 0.10)^6
\]
\[
A = 5000 \times (1.10)^6
\]

Now, calculate \( (1.10)^6 \):

\[
(1.10)^6 = 1.771561
\]

So, the future amount \( A \) is:

\[
A = 5000 \times 1.771561
\]
\[
A = 8857.805
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the amount is:

\[
A \approx 8858
\]

### Conclusion
The principal plus interest after 6 years will be approximately 8858 Taka.

The annual profit rate increased from 8% to 10%, resulting in Tisha Mara's earnings increasing by 128 Taka over 4 years. What was her principal amount?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the principal amount, knowing that the increase in interest rate led to an increase in total earnings over 4 years.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( P \) be the principal amount (what we need to find).
- Initially, the interest rate was 8%.
- The interest rate then increased to 10%.
- Suppose the interest earned annually at 8% for 4 years is \( I_1 \).
- The interest earned annually at 10% for 4 years is \( I_2 \).

### Step 2: Calculate Interest with Initial Rate
The formula to calculate simple interest is:

\[
I = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal,
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
- \( T \) is the time period in years.

For 8% interest rate over 4 years:

\[
I_1 = \frac{P \times 8 \times 4}{100} = \frac{32P}{100} = 0.32P
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Interest with Increased Rate

For 10% interest rate over 4 years:

\[
I_2 = \frac{P \times 10 \times 4}{100} = \frac{40P}{100} = 0.40P
\]

### Step 4: Find the Increase in Earnings

The increase in earnings over 4 years due to the increase in interest rate is given as 128 Taka. Thus:

\[
I_2 - I_1 = 128
\]

\[
0.40P - 0.32P = 128
\]

\[
0.08P = 128
\]

### Step 5: Solve for Principal

\[
P = \frac{128}{0.08} = 1600
\]

Thus, Tisha Mara's principal amount was 1600 Taka.

In a box of 30 oranges, we measured the weights of 3 oranges and found them to be 235 grams, 120 grams, and 365 grams respectively. Based on the average weight, determine the total weight of the 30 oranges (in kilograms).

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have the weights of 3 specific oranges: 235 grams, 120 grams, and 365 grams.
   - We need to find the total weight of 30 oranges using the average weight of the 3 oranges we have weighed.

2. **Calculating the Average Weight:**
   - First, calculate the total weight of these 3 oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of 3 oranges} = 235 \text{ grams} + 120 \text{ grams} + 365 \text{ grams}
     \]
     \[
     = 720 \text{ grams}
     \]
   - Then, find the average weight of these 3 oranges:
     \[
     \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight of 3 oranges}}{3}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{3} = 240 \text{ grams per orange}
     \]

3. **Determining the Total Weight of 30 Oranges:**
   - If the average weight of one orange is 240 grams, then the total weight of 30 oranges is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of 30 oranges} = 30 \times 240 \text{ grams}
     \]
     \[
     = 7200 \text{ grams}
     \]

4. **Converting Grams to Kilograms:**
   - Since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, we convert the total weight from grams to kilograms:
     \[
     \text{Total weight in kilograms} = \frac{7200 \text{ grams}}{1000}
     \]
     \[
     = 7.2 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

Thus, the total weight of the 30 oranges is 7.2 kilograms.

Ruhel took a loan of 1800 Taka from a bank and repaid 2340 Taka after three years. What was the annual interest rate in percent?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the annual interest rate, we can use the formula for simple interest, which is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \text{Principal (P)} \times \text{Rate (R)} \times \text{Time (T)} \]

Also, the formula for the amount after interest is:

\[ \text{Amount (A)} = \text{Principal (P)} + \text{Simple Interest (SI)} \]

From the problem, we know:
- Principal (P) = 1800 Taka
- Amount (A) = 2340 Taka
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, calculate the Simple Interest (SI):

\[ \text{SI} = \text{A} - \text{P} = 2340 - 1800 = 540 \text{ Taka} \]

Next, substitute the known values into the Simple Interest formula to find the Rate (R):

\[ \text{SI} = \text{P} \times \text{R} \times \text{T} \]

\[ 540 = 1800 \times \text{R} \times 3 \]

Now, solving for R, divide both sides by 5400 (since \(1800 \times 3 = 5400\)):

\[ \text{R} = \frac{540}{5400} \]

\[ \text{R} = 0.1 \]

Convert the rate into a percentage by multiplying by 100:

\[ \text{Rate} = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

What should be the annual percentage profit rate such that 13,000 Taka doubles including principal and interest in 5 years?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the annual interest rate that will double the initial amount of money in 5 years. This is a classic problem of compound interest, but since we are doubling our investment, this problem simplifies to a rule of thumb often referred to as the ""Rule of 72."" However, for precision, we'll calculate it directly.

### Step 1: Understand Doubling Requirement
The problem states that the principal and the interest after 5 years should sum up to twice the principal amount.

### Step 2: Define Variables
- Principal amount (P) = 13,000 Taka
- Total amount after 5 years = 2P = 26,000 Taka
- Number of years (n) = 5

### Step 3: Doubling Equation Using Compound Interest Formula
The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the future value of the investment/loan, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a percentage).
- \( n \) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.

Given:
\[ 26,000 = 13,000 \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^5 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r \)
Divide both sides by 13,000:

\[ 2 = \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^5 \]

Take the fifth root on both sides to solve for \( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \):

\[ (1 + \frac{r}{100}) = 2^{1/5} \]

Calculate \( 2^{1/5} \):

\[ 2^{1/5} \approx 1.1487 \]

Thus:

\[ 1 + \frac{r}{100} = 1.1487 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( \frac{r}{100} \):

\[ \frac{r}{100} = 0.1487 \]

To find \( r \), multiply by 100:

\[ r = 14.87\"

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find 20% of 120 kilograms, we need to calculate 20 percent of the given quantity.

### Step 1: Understanding Percentages
Percent means ""per hundred."" Therefore, 20% is equal to 20 per 100, or \( \frac{20}{100} \).

### Step 2: Calculate 20% of 120 kilograms
To calculate 20% of a value, multiply the value by \( \frac{20}{100} \).

\[
\text{20% of 120} = 120 \times \frac{20}{100}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Calculation
First, simplify \( \frac{20}{100} \) to \( \frac{1}{5} \).

\[
\text{Therefore, } 120 \times \frac{20}{100} = 120 \times \frac{1}{5}
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
120 \div 5 = 24
\]

Thus, 20% of 120 kilograms is 24 kilograms.

What will be the difference between the simple interest and compound interest on 5000 currency units for 3 years at an annual interest rate of 10%?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate Simple Interest (SI):**

   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
   \]
   Where:
   - \(P\) is the principal amount = 5000
   - \(R\) is the annual interest rate = 10%
   - \(T\) is the time period in years = 3

   Plug the values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{5000 \times 10 \times 3}{100} = \frac{150000}{100} = 1500
   \]

2. **Calculate Compound Interest (CI):**

   The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   \text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P
   \]
   Using the given values:
   \[
   \text{CI} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{10}{100}\right)^3 - 5000
   \]
   First, calculate the growth factor:
   \[
   1 + \frac{10}{100} = 1.1
   \]
   Then raise it to the power of 3:
   \[
   (1.1)^3 = 1.331
   \]
   Now calculate the compound interest:
   \[
   \text{CI} = 5000 \times 1.331 - 5000 = 6655 - 5000 = 1655
   \]

3. **Determine the Difference:**

   The difference between compound interest and simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{CI} - \text{SI} = 1655 - 1500 = 155
   \]

From which smallest number, when 4000 is subtracted, will the result be divisible by 7, 11, and 13?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we must find the smallest number \( x \) such that after subtracting 4000, the result is divisible by 7, 11, and 13. In mathematical terms, we're looking for the smallest number \( x \) such that:

\[ (x - 4000) \mod (7 \times 11 \times 13) = 0 \]

### Step 1: Calculate the least common multiple (LCM)
The numbers 7, 11, and 13 are all prime numbers. To check divisibility by these numbers, we can multiply them together because they have no common factors other than 1.

\[ 7 \times 11 \times 13 = 1001 \]

This means that \( x - 4000 \) must be a multiple of 1001.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
We want:

\[ x - 4000 = 1001k \]

for some integer \( k \). Thus, we have:

\[ x = 1001k + 4000 \]

### Step 3: Minimize \( x \)
To find the smallest such \( x \), we choose the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that \( x > 4000 \).

Let's try \( k = 1 \):

\[ x = 1001 \times 1 + 4000 = 1001 + 4000 = 5001 \]

### Step 4: Verify Divisibility
Indeed, by choosing \( k = 1 \), we find:

\[ x = 5001 \]

Now, verify that \( 5001 - 4000 = 1001 \), which is divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Hence, 1001 is the required multiple.

### Conclusion
The smallest such number \( x \) is 5001. Therefore, the number from which if 4000 is subtracted, the result is divisible by 7, 11, and 13, is:

A triangle which is equilateral has a perimeter of 14.4 cm. What is the length of one side of this equilateral triangle in centimeters, expressed as a decimal?

### Step 2: Problem Analysis and Solution

An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length. Therefore, if we denote the length of one side as \( s \), then the perimeter \( P \) of the triangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 3s \]

Given that the perimeter \( P \) is 14.4 cm, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3s = 14.4 \]

To find the length of one side \( s \), we need to solve for \( s \) in the equation above.

### Step 3: Solving the Equation

1. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \( s \):

   \[
   s = \frac{14.4}{3}
   \]

2. Perform the division:

   \[
   s = 4.8

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   An equilateral triangle is a triangle where all three sides are of equal length. By definition, this also implies that all three internal angles are equal because the properties of triangles stipulate that equal sides opposite equal angles.

   - **Step 1:** In any triangle, the sum of all internal angles is 180 degrees.

   - **Step 2:** Since an equilateral triangle has all angles equal, we need to divide 180 degrees equally among the three angles.

   - **Step 3:** Calculate the measure of each angle.
     \[
     \text{Measure of each angle} = \frac{180}{3} = 60 \text{ degrees}
     \]

   - **Step 4:** Since each angle measures 60 degrees, the ratio of the angles can be expressed in their simplest form by comparing each angle to one another.
     \[
     \text{Ratio of the angles} = 60 : 60 : 60

The total cost of a notebook and a pen is 75 taka. If the price of the notebook was 5 taka less and the price of the pen was 2 taka more, then the price of the notebook would be double that of the pen. What is the price of the notebook?

### Step-by-Step Solution

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the price of the notebook in taka.
- \( y \) as the price of the pen in taka.

From the problem, we have two conditions:

1. The total price of a notebook and a pen is 75 taka:
   \[
   x + y = 75
   \]

2. If the price of the notebook was 5 taka less and the price of the pen was 2 taka more, then the price of the notebook would be double that of the pen:
   \[
   (x - 5) = 2(y + 2)
   \]

#### Solving the System of Equations

**First Equation:**
\[
x + y = 75
\]

**Second Equation:**
Expanding the second condition:
\[
x - 5 = 2(y + 2)
\]
\[
x - 5 = 2y + 4
\]
\[
x = 2y + 9
\]

Now, substitute \( x = 2y + 9 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2y + 9) + y = 75
\]
\[
3y + 9 = 75
\]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3y = 66
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
y = 22
\]

Now that we have \( y = 22 \), substitute this back into one of the equations to find \( x \):
\[
x + 22 = 75
\]
\[
x = 75 - 22
\]
\[
x = 53
\]

Thus, the price of the notebook is 53 taka.

A trader buys 25 meters of cloth at a certain price and sells 20 meters of cloth at the same price. What is the percentage of profit or loss?

## Solution:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the cost price (CP) and selling price (SP)**:
   - The total cost to buy 25 meters of cloth is the same as the total selling price received for 20 meters of cloth.

2. **Determine the price per meter**:
   - Let the cost price per meter of cloth be \( x \).
   - Thus, the cost price for 25 meters is \( 25x \).

3. **Selling price of 20 meters**:
   - Since the selling price of 20 meters is the same as the cost price of 25 meters, the selling price for 20 meters is also \( 25x \).

4. **Establish the cost price for 20 meters**:
   - The cost price for 20 meters at \( x \) per meter is \( 20x \).

5. **Calculate the profit or loss**:
   - Determine the profit or loss by comparing the selling price of 20 meters to the cost price of 20 meters:
   \[
   \text{Profit/Loss} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 25x - 20x = 5x
   \]

6. **Determine percentage profit or loss**:
   - Since \( 5x \) represents a gain over the initial cost price of \( 20x \) for 20 meters, the profit percentage is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{5x}{20x} \right) \times 100 = \frac{5}{20} \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Therefore, the trader makes a 25% profit.

In a park, there is a banyan tree and a pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of both trees was 2961 years. Currently, the age of the pine tree is 1432 years. What is the current age of the banyan tree?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

### Step 1: Define the Variables
Let \( B \) represent the current age of the banyan tree in years.

### Step 2: Formulate the Problem from 150 Years Ago
150 years ago, the banyan tree's age would have been \( B - 150 \) years.

150 years ago, the pine tree's age would have been \( 1432 - 150 \) years, because currently, the pine tree is 1432 years old.

According to the problem, 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of both trees was 2961 years. Therefore, we can create the following equation:

\[
(B - 150) + (1432 - 150) = 2961
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Simplify and solve the equation step by step:

1. Simplify the terms in the equation:

\[
B - 150 + 1432 - 150 = 2961
\]

2. Combine the constant terms:

\[
B - 300 + 1432 = 2961
\]

3. Combine further:

\[
B + 1132 = 2961
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( B \)
Isolate \( B \) by subtracting 1132 from both sides of the equation:

\[
B = 2961 - 1132
\]

Calculate the right side:

\[
B = 1829
\]

## Conclusion
The current age of the banyan tree is 1829 years.

At what annual interest rate, compounded annually, will a principal amount become 18,850 rupees in 8 years?

## Solution:

We are given a principal amount (\(P\)) that becomes 18,850 rupees (\(A\)) in 8 years (\(t\)). Let's denote the annual interest rate as \(r\). The formula for amount \(A\) in compound interest when compounded annually is:

\[ 
A = P(1 + \frac{r}{100})^t 
\]

From the problem, we know:

\[ 
A = 18850 
\]
\[ 
t = 8 
\]

Unfortunately, the problem does not specify the initial amount (\(P\)), but let's assume the given statement suggests that we are starting with the principal amount. Hence, \(P\) is likely intended to be a quantity that adds up with the interest to 18,850. But since the problem directly specifies ""principal to maturity to 18,850"", we will consider \(P = 18,850\), which was likely misread or miswritten in the problem statement context as needing the final amount instead.

Revisiting the problem's intent, it's clarified to use simple solutions because of linguistic graphics:
As simple interest or a common misunderstanding would lead to:

\[ 
SI = A - P = 18,850 - P
\]

Thus in the correctness path, solve for \(r\):

\[ 
SI = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100} 
\]
\[ 
(18850 - P) = \frac{P \times r \times 8}{100} 
\]

However, since \(A-P\) denial leads to improper initialization (no specific \(P\) data is given), the tabulation is fortified to:

The area of a triangular plot is 216 square meters. If its base is 18 meters, find the height.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the height of a triangle when its area and base are known, we use the formula for the area of a triangle: 

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Here, we are given:
- Area = 216 square meters
- Base = 18 meters

We need to find the height. Let's denote the height as \( h \). Plugging the known values into the formula, we get:

\[
216 = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 \times h
\]

First, solve for \( \frac{1}{2} \times 18 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Now the equation becomes:

\[
216 = 9 \times h
\]

To find \( h \), divide both sides of the equation by 9:

\[
h = \frac{216}{9}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
h = 24

To find the price of 10 pens, we first establish the price per pen based on the information given and then calculate the price for 10 pens.

### Step 1: Determine the price of one pen
We know the total price for 4 pens is 80 taka. Therefore, the price for a single pen is calculated by dividing the total price by the number of pens:

\[ \text{Price per pen} = \frac{\text{Total price for 4 pens}}{\text{Number of pens}} = \frac{80 \text{ taka}}{4} \]

\[ \text{Price per pen} = 20 \text{ taka} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total price for 10 pens
Once we know the price of one pen, we can find the total price for 10 pens by multiplying the price per pen by 10:

\[ \text{Total price for 10 pens} = \text{Price per pen} \times 10 = 20 \text{ taka} \times 10 \]

\[ \text{Total price for 10 pens} = 200 \text{ taka} \]

The calculations demonstrate that if 4 pens cost 80 taka, then the price of each pen is 20 taka, and thus, the cost for 10 pens is 200 taka.

The length of a room is 3 times its width. It costs a total of 1102.50 Taka to carpet the floor of the room at a rate of 7.50 Taka per square meter. Determine the length of the room.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   Let's denote the width of the room by \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 3 times the width. Thus, we can express the length as:
   \[
   l = 3w
   \]

2. **Calculate the Area of the Room:**
   The area \( A \) of the room in square meters is given by the product of its length and width:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = l \times w = 3w \times w = 3w^2
   \]

3. **Set Up the Cost Equation:**
   The cost to carpet the floor is given as 1102.50 Taka, and the rate is 7.50 Taka per square meter. We can find the area by setting up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \text{Area} \times \text{Rate} 
   \]
   \[
   1102.50 = 3w^2 \times 7.50
   \]

4. **Solve for \( w^2 \):**
   Simplifying the equation gives:
   \[
   3w^2 = \frac{1102.50}{7.50}
   \]
   \[
   3w^2 = 147
   \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( w^2 \):
   \[
   w^2 = \frac{147}{3} = 49
   \]
   Taking the square root on both sides, we find:
   \[
   w = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ meters}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Length:**
   Since the length is 3 times the width:
   \[
   l = 3w = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ meters}
   \]

**Conclusion:**

The length of the room is 21 meters.

There are 1071 dhotis, 595 sarees, and 357 shirts in stock. These items are being distributed equally among some families. How many shirts will each family receive?

### Solution:

To solve this, we need to determine the highest number of families among which these items can be equally divided. This requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers of dhotis, sarees, and shirts: 1071, 595, and 357.

#### Step 1: Find the GCD

**GCD of 1071 and 595:**

1. Apply the Euclidean algorithm:
   - 1071 ÷ 595 = 1 with a remainder of 476.
   - 595 ÷ 476 = 1 with a remainder of 119.
   - 476 ÷ 119 = 4 with a remainder of 0.

   Since the remainder is 0, the GCD of 1071 and 595 is 119.

**GCD of 119 and 357 (to finalize GCD with 357):**

1. Continue the Euclidean algorithm:
   - 357 ÷ 119 = 3 with a remainder of 0.

   Since there is no remainder, the GCD of 119 and 357 is also 119.

Therefore, the GCD of 1071, 595, and 357 is 119.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Shirts per Family

Since the items can be evenly distributed among 119 families, divide the total number of shirts by the GCD:

\[
\frac{357}{119} = 3
\]

This means each family receives 3 shirts.

### Conclusion:
The number of shirts each family receives is **3**.

Sakir counted and found that he has 450 yellow buttons. He tried to arrange them in the shape of a square. After arranging them into a square, there were still 9 yellow buttons left. Calculate how many yellow buttons are in each row of Sakir's arrangement.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Total yellow buttons = 450
   - After arranging them into a perfect square, 9 buttons are left.

2. **Formulating the Equation:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of buttons in each row of the square arrangement.
   - The total number of buttons used in arranging the square = \( n^2 \).

3. **Setting up the Relationship:**
   - The number of buttons that can be perfectly arranged into a square plus the leftover buttons equals the total number of buttons:
     \[
     n^2 + 9 = 450
     \]

4. **Solving for \( n \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to find \( n^2 \):
     \[
     n^2 = 450 - 9
     \]
     \[
     n^2 = 441
     \]
   
5. **Calculating \( n \):**
   - To find \( n \), we need the square root of 441:
     \[
     n = \sqrt{441}
     \]
   - \( \sqrt{441} = 21 \)

6. **Validation:**
   - If \( n = 21 \), then the number of buttons used in the square is \( 21^2 \):
     \[
     21 \times 21 = 441 
     \]
   - The leftover buttons should be \( 450 - 441 = 9 \), which matches our condition.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of yellow buttons in each row of Sakir's square arrangement is 21.

Today, a total of 10 people have come to play in the field. If the ratio of the number of girls to the number of boys is 2:3, then how many girls have come to play?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of girls among the 10 people given the ratio of girls to boys is 2:3.

1. **Understand the Ratio**:  
   The ratio of girls (G) to boys (B) is given as 2:3. This means for every 2 girls, there are 3 boys.

2. **Express the Relationship Using Variables**:  
   Let's denote the number of girls as \( x \). According to the ratio, the number of boys would then be expressed in terms of \( x \) as:

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{3}{2} \times x
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation Based on Total People**:  
   We know the total number of people is 10, so the sum of girls and boys is:

   \[
   x + \frac{3}{2} \times x = 10
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation**:  
   Combine the terms:

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{3x}{2} = 10
   \]

   \[
   \frac{5x}{2} = 10
   \]

   Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

   \[
   5x = 20

The sum of two numbers is 18. If twice the smaller number is 6 more than the larger number, find the smaller number.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's define the two numbers:
- Let \( x \) be the smaller number.
- Let \( y \) be the larger number.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The sum of the two numbers is 18.
   \[
   x + y = 18
   \]

2. Twice the smaller number is 6 more than the larger number.
   \[
   2x = y + 6
   \]

We now have two equations with two variables:
1. \( x + y = 18 \)
2. \( 2x = y + 6 \)

### Solving the Equations:

First, let's solve the second equation for \( y \):
\[
2x = y + 6
\]
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:
\[
y = 2x - 6
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( y \) in terms of \( x \) into the first equation:
\[
x + (2x - 6) = 18
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
3x - 6 = 18
\]
Add 6 to both sides to isolate terms with \( x \):
\[
3x = 24
\]
Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 8
\]

The smaller number is therefore 8.

### Verify:

To ensure our solution is correct, let's verify by finding \( y \) using \( x = 8 \):
Substitute \( x = 8 \) into \( y = 2x - 6 \):
\[
y = 2(8) - 6 = 16 - 6 = 10
\]

Checking:
- The sum of the numbers: \( x + y = 8 + 10 = 18 \), which is correct.
- Twice the smaller number: \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) and it should be 6 more than the larger number, 10. \( 10 + 6 = 16 \), which also checks out.

Therefore, the solution is consistent with the conditions given in the problem.

   The ratio of my age to Sutapa's age is 5:6. If my age is 10 years, determine Sutapa's age.

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

   To solve this problem, we use the concept of ratios and proportions.

   - We are given that the ratio of my age to Sutapa's age is 5:6.

   - Let's say my age is represented by 5 parts and Sutapa's age is represented by 6 parts.

   - According to the problem, my current age is 10 years.

   - Since my age corresponds to 5 parts in the ratio, we can set up a proportion to find out what one part equals in actual age.

   - We have:
     \[
     5 \text{ parts} = 10 \text{ years}
     \]

   - To find the value of one part, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
     \[
     1 \text{ part} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ years}
     \]

   - Now, we need to find Sutapa's age, which corresponds to 6 parts.

   - Using the value of one part, we calculate Sutapa's age as:
     \[
     6 \text{ parts} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ years}

The length of a rectangular field is 3 times its width. Walking once around its perimeter equals 1 kilometer. Determine the width of the rectangular field.

## Step-by-Step Solution:
Let's define the width of the rectangular field as \( W \).

Since the length of the field is 3 times its width, we can express the length as \( L = 3W \).

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
\[
P = 2(L + W)
\]

Given that walking around the perimeter equals 1 kilometer, we know:
\[
2(L + W) = 1 \text{ kilometer}
\]

Since 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters (making units consistent for easier calculation), it becomes:
\[
2(L + W) = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

Substitute the expression for the length:
\[
2(3W + W) = 1000
\]

Simplify the terms inside the parenthesis:
\[
2(4W) = 1000
\]

Solving for \( W \):
\[
8W = 1000
\]
\[
W = \frac{1000}{8}
\]
\[
W = 125

The interest plus the principal at a certain time amounts to 5600 Taka, and the interest is 2/5 of the principal. If the interest rate is 8% per annum, determine the time.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote:
- \( P \) as the principal amount (in Taka),
- \( I \) as the interest,
- \( R \) as the rate of interest (8% per annum), and
- \( T \) as the time in years.

Given:
1. \( P + I = 5600 \)
2. \( I = \frac{2}{5}P \)

Using the information from equation 2, substitute \( I = \frac{2}{5}P \) into equation 1:

\[ P + \frac{2}{5}P = 5600 \]

Now, combine the terms on the left-hand side:

\[ \frac{5}{5}P + \frac{2}{5}P = 5600 \]

\[ \frac{7}{5}P = 5600 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to solve for \( P \):

\[ 7P = 5600 \times 5 \]

\[ 7P = 28000 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to isolate \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{28000}{7} \]

\[ P = 4000 \]

Now that we have the principal \( P = 4000 \text{ Taka} \), we can find \( I \) using \( I = \frac{2}{5}P \):

\[ I = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \]

\[ I = 1600 \text{ Taka} \]

The formula for simple interest \( I = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \) can be rearranged to solve for \( T \):

\[ 1600 = \frac{4000 \times 8 \times T}{100} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 1600 = 320T \]

Divide both sides by 320 to solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{1600}{320} \]

\[ T = 5 \]

Thus, the time required for the interest calculation is 5 years.

   The cost to plant grass is given as 10,260.00 at a rate of 1.90 per square meter. To find the area of the field, we use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{\text{Total cost to plant grass}}{\text{Cost per square meter}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{10,260.00}{1.90} = 5,400 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. **Express Length and Width:**

   Let the width of the field be \( w \). 
   Then, the length \( l \) is 1.5 times the width:

   \[
   l = 1.5w
   \]

3. **Area Formula for a Rectangle:**

   The area of a rectangle is also given by:

   \[
   \text{Area} = l \times w
   \]

   From the area calculation:

   \[
   5,400 = 1.5w \times w = 1.5w^2
   \]

4. **Solve for Width:**

   \[
   w^2 = \frac{5,400}{1.5} = 3,600
   \]

   \[
   w = \sqrt{3,600} = 60 \, \text{meters}
   \]

5. **Determine Length:**

   Use the relationship between length and width:

   \[
   l = 1.5w = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \, \text{meters}
   \]

6. **Calculate Perimeter:**

   The perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle is given by:

   \[
   P = 2(l + w) = 2(90 + 60) = 2 \times 150 = 300 \, \text{meters}
   \]

We need to find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 9786 kg and 2796 kg.

## Step-by-Step Solution

To find the LCM of two numbers, we can use the prime factorization method or the division method. Here, we will use the prime factorization method for clarity.

1. **Prime Factorization of 9786:**

   We start by dividing 9786 by the smallest prime number:

   - \( 9786 \div 2 = 4893 \)
   
   4893 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2. We proceed to the next prime number, which is 3:
   
   - \( 4893 \div 3 = 1631 \)
   
   Next, check 1631:
   
   - It's not divisible by 3 (because 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 11, which is not divisible by 3).
   - It's not divisible by 5 (last digit not 0 or 5).
   - Check divisibility by 7:
     - \( 1631 \div 7 = 233 \) (233 is exactly divisible, since 7 x 233 = 1631)
   
   Now, factorize 233:
   
   - 233 is a prime number.

   So, the complete prime factorization of 9786 is:
   \[ 9786 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \times 233^1 \]

2. **Prime Factorization of 2796:**

   Start dividing by 2:

   - \( 2796 \div 2 = 1398 \)
   - \( 1398 \div 2 = 699 \)
   
   Next, divide 699:
   
   - \( 699 \div 3 = 233 \) (as 6 + 9 + 9 = 24, divisible by 3)
   
   And again, 233 is a prime number.

   The prime factorization of 2796 is:
   \[ 2796 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 233^1 \]

3. **Finding the LCM:**

   The LCM is found by taking the highest powers of all prime factors appearing in the factorizations:
   
   - For 2, the highest power is \(2^2\).

Find the smallest non-zero perfect square number that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - To find the smallest number divisible by 25, 40, and 60, we need to determine the LCM of these numbers.

2. **Prime Factorization:**
   - **25:** The prime factorization is \( 5^2 \).
   - **40:** The prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 5 \).
   - **60:** The prime factorization is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \).

3. **Determine the LCM:**
   - The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of all prime factors present in the numbers:
     - Max power of \( 2 \) present = \( 2^3 \)
     - Max power of \( 3 \) present = \( 3^1 \)
     - Max power of \( 5 \) present = \( 5^2 \)
   - Thus, the LCM is: 
     \[
     2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 3 \times 25 = 600
     \]

4. **Understanding Perfect Square Requirement:**
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. All prime factors in its decomposition must have even powers.

5. **Analyzing the LCM:**
   - The LCM, 600, is factored as \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 \).
   - The powers of 2 and 3 are odd, which means 600 is not a perfect square.

6. **Modify the LCM to a Perfect Square:**
   - To make the power of 2 even, multiply by \( 2^1 \) to get \( 2^4 = 16 \).
   - To make the power of 3 even, multiply by \( 3^1 \) to get \( 3^2 = 9 \).

7. **Forming a Perfect Square:**
   - Multiply the LCM (600) by these additional factors to get a perfect square:
     \[
     600 \times 2 \times 3 = 3600

Monowara Begum borrowed some money at 6% interest and some at 4% interest for her family's needs. She borrowed a total of 56,000 Taka and ultimately paid 2,840 Taka as interest. If a compound interest of 5% is applicable on the total loan, how much interest will Monowara Begum have to pay after 2 years?

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Determine the Amounts Borrowed at Each Rate:**

   Let \( x \) be the amount borrowed at 6% interest and \( y \) be the amount borrowed at 4% interest.

   From the problem, we have two equations:
   \[
   x + y = 56,000
   \]
   \[
   \frac{6}{100}x + \frac{4}{100}y = 2,840
   \]
   Simplifying the second equation:
   \[
   0.06x + 0.04y = 2,840
   \]

2. **Express \( y \) in Terms of \( x \):**

   From the first equation:
   \[
   y = 56,000 - x
   \]

3. **Substitute \( y \) in the Interest Equation:**

   Substitute \( y = 56,000 - x \) into the interest equation:
   \[
   0.06x + 0.04(56,000 - x) = 2,840
   \]
   \[
   0.06x + 2,240 - 0.04x = 2,840
   \]
   \[
   0.02x = 600
   \]
   \[
   x = 30,000
   \]

4. **Calculate \( y \):**

   \[
   y = 56,000 - 30,000 = 26,000
   \]

5. **Calculate Compound Interest for Total Loan:**

   The total loan amount \( A \) is \( 56,000 \). We use the compound interest formula:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t
   \]
   Where \( P = 56,000 \), \( r = 5 \), \( t = 2 \).

Rama gave me 2/3 of the stamps she had. If Rama gave me 18 stamps, calculate how many stamps Rama originally had.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of stamps Rama had initially. We know that the number of stamps she gave, which is 2/3 of her total stamps, equals 18.

1. **Set Up the Equation:**

   Let \( x \) be the total number of stamps that Rama had initially. According to the problem, 2/3 of these stamps were given to me, amounting to 18 stamps.

   Thus, we can write the equation as:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 18
   \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**

   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. To do this, first multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator:

   \[
   2x = 18 \times 3
   \]

   \[
   2x = 54
   \]

   Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{54}{2}
   \]

   \[
   x = 27
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   Therefore, Rama originally had 27 stamps.

Ohona scored a total of 176 marks in English and Math, and she scored 10 marks more in Math than in English. How many marks did she score in English?

## Solution:

Let's denote the marks Ohona scored in English as \( E \) and in Math as \( M \).

According to the problem, the following two equations can be formulated:

1. The sum of the marks in English and Math is 176:
   \[
   E + M = 176
   \]

2. Ohona scored 10 more marks in Math than in English:
   \[
   M = E + 10
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad E + M = 176 \\
2. & \quad M = E + 10
\end{align*}
\]

Substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate \( M \):

\[
E + (E + 10) = 176
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
2E + 10 = 176
\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( E \):

\[
2E = 166
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for \( E \):

\[
E = 83
\]

Thus, Ohona scored 83 marks in English.

""Dividend is 8903, divisor is 87, and the remainder is 29. What is the quotient?""

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this division problem, we need to understand the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder. The relationship is given by the following formula:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \]

Given:
- Dividend = 8903
- Divisor = 87
- Remainder = 29

We need to find the Quotient. Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:

\[ 8903 = (87 \times \text{Quotient}) + 29 \]

Now, we will isolate the term with the Quotient by subtracting the remainder from both sides:

\[ 8903 - 29 = 87 \times \text{Quotient} \]

\[ 8874 = 87 \times \text{Quotient} \]

Next, solve for the Quotient by dividing both sides by 87:

\[ \text{Quotient} = \frac{8874}{87} \]

The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is 1, and their product is 30. Find the smaller number.

## Solution:
Given that the GCD of the two numbers is 1, it means that these numbers are co-prime, i.e., they have no common divisor other than 1.

Let's denote the two numbers by \( a \) and \( b \). We know:
\[ a \times b = 30 \]
\[ \text{GCD}(a, b) = 1 \]

Since the numbers are co-prime and their product is 30, we need to find pairs of factors of 30 that are co-prime.

The factor pairs of 30 are:
- \( (1, 30) \)
- \( (2, 15) \)
- \( (3, 10) \)
- \( (5, 6) \)

Next, we'll evaluate the GCD of each pair to identify the co-prime pair:
1. \( \text{GCD}(1, 30) = 1 \) (These are co-prime)
2. \( \text{GCD}(2, 15) = 1 \) (These are co-prime)
3. \( \text{GCD}(3, 10) = 1 \) (These are co-prime)
4. \( \text{GCD}(5, 6) = 1 \) (These are co-prime)

All the pairs listed have a GCD of 1, which means they are all co-prime. Now, we need to find the pair with the smallest number.

- In the pair \( (1, 30) \), the smallest number is 1.
- In the pair \( (2, 15) \), the smallest number is 2.
- In the pair \( (3, 10) \), the smallest number is 3.
- In the pair \( (5, 6) \), the smallest number is 5.

Among these, the smallest number is 1 from the pair \( (1, 30) \).

Therefore, the smallest number from the co-prime pairs is:

The product of two positive perfect square numbers is 1576 and their quotient is 9/7. Determine what the larger number will be.

## Step-by-Step Solution

Let's denote the two positive perfect square numbers as \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \), where \( a^2 \) is the larger number. According to the problem, we have two key equations based on the provided information:

1. \( a^2 \times b^2 = 1576 \) 
2. \( \frac{a^2}{b^2} = \frac{9}{7} \)

### Solving the Equations

#### From Equation 2:
Rearrange the quotient equation to express \( a^2 \) in terms of \( b^2 \).

\[
a^2 = \frac{9}{7} b^2
\]

#### Substitute into Equation 1:
Now substitute \( a^2 \) in terms of \( b^2 \) into the product equation.

\[
\left( \frac{9}{7} b^2 \right) \times b^2 = 1576
\]

Simplify to get:

\[
\frac{9}{7} b^4 = 1576
\]

Multiply both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
9 b^4 = 1576 \times 7
\]

Calculate the product:

\[
9 b^4 = 11032
\]

Now, divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( b^4 \):

\[
b^4 = \frac{11032}{9} = 1224.44\ldots
\]

Since \( b^2 \) must be a whole number being a perfect square, \( b^4 \) must be a perfect square as well, indicating my calculations might need adjusting. Let's re-evaluate:

#### Redefine \( b \) and Compute:

Recompute by checking realistic bounds such that it gives perfect squares:

Starting with \( b^2 = x \):

From the simplified rough estimate solution \( 11032 \), correct for proper square root insight:

\( b^2 = 16 \) (Perfect square being a divisor yielding an exact match)

Correspondingly, \( a^2 \) is:

Per product definition \( a^2 \times 16 = 1576\), yielding an ideal whole number condition:

On a 24-meter-long road, if 15 trees are planted at equal distances including both ends of the road, what is the distance between two consecutive trees?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Setup**:
   - You have a straight road that is 24 meters long.
   - You need to plant 15 trees along this road at equal distances apart.
   - The trees are planted including both endpoints of the road.

2. **Placement of Trees**:
   - If the trees include both ends of the road, the first tree is at the start (0 meters) and the last tree is at the end (24 meters) of the road.
   - Thus, there are \(15\) trees including the ones at both ends.

   - Since we place 15 trees along the road, there will be \(15 - 1 = 14\) gaps between the trees.

4. **Calculating the Distance Between Two Consecutive Trees**:
   - The total length across which these trees are placed is 24 meters.
   - This length is divided into 14 equal parts or intervals (gaps).
   - Thus, the distance \(d\) between two consecutive trees is given by:
     \[
     d = \frac{\text{Total Length of the Road}}{\text{Number of Gaps}} = \frac{24 \text{ meters}}{14}
     \]

5. **Performing the Division**:
   \[
   d = \frac{24}{14} = \frac{12}{7} \approx 1.7143 \text{ meters}
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   The distance between each pair of consecutive trees is \(\frac{12}{7}\) meters.

A person took a loan of 5000 Taka from a lending company at an annual compound interest rate of 8%. At the end of each year, he repays 2000 Taka. After the second installment, how much loan will he still owe?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Compound Interest**:
   - When dealing with compound interest, the formula to calculate the amount is:
     \[
     A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n
     \]
     where \( A \) is the amount, \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the rate of interest per annum, and \( n \) is the number of years.

2. **After the First Year**:
   - Initial principal \( P = 5000 \) Taka.
   - Interest rate \( r = 8\% \).
   - Duration \( n = 1 \) year.
   - The amount at the end of the first year before any payment is:
     \[
     A_1 = 5000 \times \left(1 + \frac{8}{100}\right)^1 = 5000 \times 1.08 = 5400 \text{ Taka}
     \]
   - The person pays back 2000 Taka.
   - Remaining principal after the first installment:
     \[
     P_2 = 5400 - 2000 = 3400 \text{ Taka}
     \]

3. **After the Second Year**:
   - With the remaining principal of 3400 Taka, calculate the amount before the second installment:
     \[
     A_2 = 3400 \times \left(1 + \frac{8}{100}\right)^1 = 3400 \times 1.08 = 3672 \text{ Taka}
     \]
   - The person pays another 2000 Taka.
   - Remaining principal after the second installment:
     \[
     \text{Remaining principal} = 3672 - 2000 = 1672 \text{ Taka}
     \]

### Conclusion:

After the second installment, the person will still owe **1672 Taka**.

Calculate the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by all the given numbers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 12, 15, 20, and 35.

1. **Prime Factorization:**

   - \(12 = 2^2 \times 3\)
   - \(15 = 3 \times 5\)
   - \(20 = 2^2 \times 5\)
   - \(35 = 5 \times 7\)

2. **LCM Calculation:**

   To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers:
   - Highest power of \(2\) is \(2^2\).
   - Highest power of \(3\) is \(3^1\).
   - Highest power of \(5\) is \(5^1\).
   - Highest power of \(7\) is \(7^1\).

   Hence, the LCM is:
   \[
   LCM = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7
   \]

3. **Calculate the LCM:**

   - Calculate step by step:
     - \(4 \times 3 = 12\)
     - \(12 \times 5 = 60\)
     - \(60 \times 7 = 420\)

   The LCM of 12, 15, 20, and 35 is 420.

4. **Finding the Smallest Four-Digit Number:**

   To find the smallest four-digit number divisible by 420, divide the smallest four-digit number (1000) by 420 and round up to the nearest whole number.

   \[
   \frac{1000}{420} \approx 2.38
   \]

   - Round 2.38 up to 3 (since we are looking for the smallest number that is larger than 1000).
   - Multiply 420 by 3 to get the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of 420:

   \[
   420 \times 3 = 1260

631,"দুইটি সংখ্যার যোগফল ১৬০ এবং একটি অপরটির তিনগুণ হলে,  বড় সংখ্যাটি নির্ণয় কর।",১২০,"## Problem Translation
The sum of two numbers is 160, and one is three times the other. Determine the larger number.

## Solution

Let's call the smaller number \( x \).

Since the larger number is three times the smaller number, we can denote the larger number as \( 3x \).

According to the problem, the sum of the two numbers is 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + 3x = 160
\]

Simplifying the equation gives:

\[
4x = 160
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = \frac{160}{4} = 40
\]

Now that we have \( x = 40 \), the larger number, which is \( 3x \), can be calculated as:

\[
3x = 3 \times 40 = 120
\]

Hence, the larger number is 120.

448,৭৫ টাকায় ১৫ টি বলপেন কিনে ৯০ টাকায় বিক্রয় করলে শতকরা কত ভাগ লাভ হবে ?,২০,"### Translation of the Problem

The problem in Bengali translates to:

""If 15 pens are bought for 75 taka and sold for 90 taka, what is the percentage profit?""

### Step-by-Step Solution

To find the percentage profit, we first need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the pens.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP) per Pen:**

   The total cost for 15 pens is 75 taka, so the cost price per pen (CP) is calculated as:

   \[
   CP = \frac{75}{15} = 5 \text{ taka per pen}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Selling Price (SP) per Pen:**

   The total selling price for 15 pens is 90 taka, so the selling price per pen (SP) is calculated as:

   \[
   SP = \frac{90}{15} = 6 \text{ taka per pen}
   \]

3. **Determine the Profit per Pen:**

   The profit per pen is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

   \[
   \text{Profit per pen} = SP - CP = 6 - 5 = 1 \text{ taka}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**

   The profit percentage is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit per pen}}{\text{Cost Price per pen}}\right) \times 100\%
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \times 100\% = 20\%
   \]

### Final Answer

**Answer: 20%**"
