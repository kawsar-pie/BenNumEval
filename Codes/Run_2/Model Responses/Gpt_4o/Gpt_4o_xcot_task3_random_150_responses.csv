- Question: Emily throws a banana on the roof, and it slides 100 mm, but when she throws it on the slide, it slides 211 mm. Where was there less friction?
- Option 1: Roof
- Option 2: Slide

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Concept of Friction:**
   - Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. When an object slides over a surface, the amount of friction indicates how much the object is being resisted by that surface.

2. **Analyze the Problem:**
   - The banana slides 100 mm on the roof and 211 mm on the slide.
   - The banana sliding more on one surface compared to another suggests that the surface where it slides more has less friction. This is because less resistance allows the banana to slide further.

3. **Comparison:**
   - On the roof, the banana only slides 100 mm.
   - On the slide, the banana slides 211 mm, which is more than double the distance on the roof.

4. **Draw Conclusion Based on Friction:**
   - The banana sliding a greater distance on the slide than on the roof indicates that the slide has less friction compared to the roof. Less friction means less force is required to move the banana, allowing it to travel further.

**Conclusion:**

- The slide had less friction since the banana traveled a greater distance on it compared to the roof.

**Question:**  
A cat and a dog both run at a speed of 5 miles per hour. If the cat runs for 1 minute and the dog runs for 1.5 minutes, which one will cover a greater distance?

**Option 1:** Cat  
**Option 2:** Dog

### Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we'll calculate the distance covered by the cat and the dog separately, using the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the distance covered by the cat.**

- Speed of the cat = 5 miles per hour
- Time for which the cat runs = 1 minute

First, we convert the time from minutes to hours, since the speed is given in miles per hour:
\[ 1 \text{ minute} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ hour} \]

Now, we calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance covered by the cat} = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{60} \text{ hour} = \frac{5}{60} \text{ miles} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered by the dog.**

- Speed of the dog = 5 miles per hour
- Time for which the dog runs = 1.5 minutes

Convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = \frac{1.5}{60} \text{ hour} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ hour} \]

Now, we calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance covered by the dog} = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1.5}{60} \text{ hour} = \frac{7.5}{60} \text{ miles} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles} \]

**Comparison:**

- Distance covered by the cat = \(\frac{1}{12}\) miles
- Distance covered by the dog = \(\frac{1}{8}\) miles

To compare these fractions:
- Convert \(\frac{1}{12}\) and \(\frac{1}{8}\) to a common denominator or compare directly by cross-multiplying.

**Question:** Tina and Mina are both driving on a highway at the same speed. Tina drives for 30.6 minutes and Mina drives for 28.76 minutes. Who drives a longer distance?

**Option 1:** Tina  
**Option 2:** Mina

## Detailed Solution

Since Tina and Mina are driving at the same speed, the distance each person drives is directly proportional to the amount of time they spend driving.

Let's denote:
- \( t_{\text{Tina}} = 30.6 \) minutes as the time Tina drives.
- \( t_{\text{Mina}} = 28.76 \) minutes as the time Mina drives.

The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since the speed is constant and equal for both, the comparison of distances can be simplified to comparing the times driven. Therefore:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Tina}} = \text{Speed} \times t_{\text{Tina}} = \text{Speed} \times 30.6 \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Mina}} = \text{Speed} \times t_{\text{Mina}} = \text{Speed} \times 28.76 \]

To determine who drives a longer distance, we simply compare \( t_{\text{Tina}} \) and \( t_{\text{Mina}} \):

- \( t_{\text{Tina}} = 30.6 \) minutes
- \( t_{\text{Mina}} = 28.76 \) minutes

Since 30.6 minutes is greater than 28.76 minutes, Tina drives for a longer duration and consequently, travels a longer distance than Mina.

## Conclusion

Therefore, Tina drives a longer distance than Mina.

   **Question**: Shiloh rolls a ball over a piece of sandpaper and notices that the ball rotates at a speed of 2 meters/second. Then, Shiloh rolls his ball over a piece of glass and the ball rotates at a speed of 5 meters/second. Why did the ball rotate faster on the glass piece?

   - **Option 1**: More friction
   - **Option 2**: Less friction

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English**:

   - **Understanding Friction and Speed**: When an object, such as a ball, rolls over a surface, the surface exerts a force known as friction that opposes the motion. The amount of friction depends on the nature of both the surface and the object. Higher friction means more resistance, slowing down the motion, whereas lower friction implies less resistance, allowing the object to move faster.

   - **Analyzing the Scenario**: On sandpaper, the ball rotates at 2 m/s. Sandpaper is a rough surface, which implies that it has a high coefficient of friction. Therefore, it exerts a higher frictional force on the ball, causing it to rotate slower.

   - **Comparison with Glass**: On glass, the ball rotates at 5 m/s. Glass is a much smoother surface compared to sandpaper, which implies it has a lower coefficient of friction. Consequently, it exerts a lower frictional force on the ball, allowing it to rotate faster.

   - **Conclusion**: The ball rotates faster on the glass piece because the glass offers less friction compared to the sandpaper. Lower friction means less resistance, resulting in an increased speed of the ball.

3. **Selecting the correct option**:

   Taking into account the reasoning that less friction from the glass surface allows the ball to rotate faster, we conclude that the correct option is:

**Question**: A swimmer crosses a lake in 5 minutes and crosses wet mud in 30 seconds. Which is less smooth?

**Option 1**: Lake  
**Option 2**: Wet Mud

## Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine which surface is less smooth based on the given times the swimmer takes to cross each surface.
   - A less smooth surface typically results in slower movement, meaning it takes longer to cross.

2. **Analyzing Time Taken**:
   - The swimmer takes 5 minutes to cross the lake.
   - The swimmer takes 30 seconds to cross the wet mud.

3. **Comparison of Smoothness**:
   - Generally, smoother surfaces allow for faster movement, implying less time is required to traverse them.
   - To deduce which surface is less smooth, consider the time taken: 
     - It takes significantly more time (5 minutes) to cross the lake compared to the much shorter time (30 seconds) to cross the wet mud.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - The longer time required to cross the lake suggests that it presents more resistance or is less conducive to efficient movement compared to the wet mud, where the swimmer takes less time.
   - Therefore, despite water's inherent fluidity, the environmental conditions or currents in the lake may lead to more resistance than simply sliding through wet mud.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - **Lake** is the surface that takes longer to cross, indicating it is less smooth relative to wet mud given these specific circumstances.

**Question:**
Mohsin's truck has an average speed of 13 miles per hour, and his car has a speed of 29 miles per hour. If he drives both on the freeway for one hour, which will cover less distance?

**Options:**
- Option 1: Truck
- Option 2: Car

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Calculate the Distance Covered by the Truck

The distance covered by any vehicle can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the speed of the truck is 13 miles per hour and the time is 1 hour.

\[ \text{Distance covered by truck} = 13 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 13 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Distance Covered by the Car

For the car, using the same formula with the speed given as 29 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance covered by car} = 29 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 29 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 3: Compare the Distances

- **Truck**: 13 miles
- **Car**: 29 miles

From the calculations above, the truck covers 13 miles while the car covers 29 miles in one hour.

### Conclusion

Since the truck covers 13 miles and the car covers 29 miles, the truck covers less distance.

**Question:**  
A trainer observed his horse running daily. The horse was able to accelerate to higher speeds in 6 seconds when no one was riding it, and it took 12 seconds when someone was riding it. When was the horse's weight less?

**Option 1:** It had a rider.  
**Option 2:** No one was riding it.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:

The problem involves understanding the relationship between acceleration, force, and mass, as dictated by Newton's Second Law of Motion, which is given by the equation:

\[
F = ma
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force,
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( a \) is the acceleration.

### Analyzing the Situation:

1. **Without a Rider:**
   - The horse accelerates to higher speeds in 6 seconds. Let's call this acceleration \( a_1 \).

2. **With a Rider:**
   - The horse accelerates to higher speeds in 12 seconds. Let's call this acceleration \( a_2 \).

### Understanding Acceleration and Mass:

- Acceleration \( a \) is inversely proportional to mass \( m \) if the force \( F \) remains constant. In simpler terms, if the horse has to accelerate faster, it generally suggests that the system (horse and potential rider) has less mass.

### Comparing Both Situations:

- **Scenario 1:** When no one is riding the horse, it accelerates in 6 seconds. This implies a higher acceleration (larger \( a \)) corresponds to a smaller mass of the system, i.e., the horse alone \( (m_1) \).

- **Scenario 2:** When a rider is on the horse, it accelerates in 12 seconds. This implies a lower acceleration (smaller \( a \)) corresponds to a larger mass of the system, i.e., the horse plus the rider \( (m_2) \). Since \( m_2 > m_1 \), the system is heavier with a rider.

### Conclusion:

The horse's weight is effectively less when there is no additional mass (i.e., no rider) involved. Hence, the scenario when no one is riding the horse corresponds to a lighter weight scenario.

Thus, the correct option is:

**Question**: While driving, Mary found out that the coefficient of friction in the forest is 0.7, where it is 0.1 more on the road compared to the forest. Where is her vehicle speed greater?

**Option 1**: Forest  
**Option 2**: Tundra  

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine where Mary's vehicle speed is greater, let's analyze the situation based on the given information about friction.

1. **Coefficient of Friction and Its Impact on Speed**:
   - The coefficient of friction (\( \mu \)) affects the grip or traction between a vehicle's tires and the surface it is driving on.
   - A higher coefficient of friction generally allows for higher maximum possible speed before skidding or slipping occurs, assuming the same force.

2. **Comparing the Given Coefficients**:
   - In the forest, the coefficient of friction is \( \mu_{\text{forest}} = 0.7 \).
   - We are told that the coefficient of friction on the road is 0.1 more than in the forest:  
     \[
     \mu_{\text{road}} = \mu_{\text{forest}} + 0.1 = 0.7 + 0.1 = 0.8
     \]

3. **Where is Speed Greater?**:
   - Higher friction (\( \mu \)) allows for greater vehicle control and potentially higher speeds without losing traction.
   - Given that the road has a higher friction coefficient than the forest (\( \mu_{\text{road}} = 0.8 \) vs. \( \mu_{\text{forest}} = 0.7 \)), Mary’s vehicle can achieve and maintain higher speeds on the road without skidding.
   - Therefore, with greater friction on the road, Mary's vehicle speed will be greater there.

However, since the options provided are ""Forest"" and ""Tundra"", and assuming there might be an error and ""Tundra"" was meant to imply the comparably better frictional surface (i.e., the road), the correct selection should be based on the logic that driving conditions with higher friction allow for greater speed.

Thus, the logically correct option is:

### Question:
I can travel in a car at a speed of 6 m/s and on a bicycle at a speed of 20 m/s. Which is slower?

### Options:
1. Bicycle
2. Car

## Solution Explanation

To determine which mode of transportation is slower, we need to compare their speeds directly. The question gives us the speeds of both:

- Speed of the car: 6 meters per second (m/s)
- Speed of the bicycle: 20 meters per second (m/s)

According to the problem, the object with the lower speed is considered slower. Thus, we compare the numerical values of these speeds:

1. **Car:** 6 m/s
2. **Bicycle:** 20 m/s

Clearly, 6 m/s is less than 20 m/s. Therefore, the car, traveling at 6 m/s, is slower than the bicycle, which travels at 20 m/s.

## Conclusion

The car, moving at 6 m/s, is slower compared to the bicycle, which moves at 20 m/s.

**Question:** Tina is racing her two dogs. The Greyhound weighs 40 kg, and her Rottweiler weighs 35 kg. Which dog runs faster?

**Option 1:** Rottweiler  
**Option 2:** Greyhound

## Solution:

To find out which dog runs faster, let's consider the general characteristics and physical attributes regarding the two breeds mentioned:

1. **Greyhound:**
   - Greyhounds are known for their incredible speed and agility. They are one of the fastest dog breeds in the world.
   - They have a lean and aerodynamic body structure optimized for running.
   - A Greyhound can reach speeds of up to 40-45 miles per hour.

2. **Rottweiler:**
   - Rottweilers are strong and robust dogs known for their strength and endurance rather than speed.
   - They have a more muscular and compact body which suits them for tasks requiring power rather than speed.
   - Typically, a Rottweiler runs at speeds of around 15-25 miles per hour, which is significantly slower compared to a Greyhound.

Given this information, even though the Greyhound weighs slightly more than the Rottweiler (40 kg versus 35 kg), the Greyhound's body structure and breed characteristics make it naturally faster.

## Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning about the typical speed capabilities of these breeds, the Greyhound is the faster runner.

**Question:**  
A little boy rolled his two rubber balls down the hallway. The red ball stopped after 1 minute and 23 seconds. The blue one stopped after 29 seconds. Which one rolled the farthest?

**Option 1:** Red ball  
**Option 2:** Blue ball

## Solution

To determine which ball rolled the farthest, we need to consider the time each ball took to come to a stop. Assuming both balls rolled under similar conditions and started with similar initial velocities, the ball that rolls for a longer period would cover a greater distance, as it has more time to travel before stopping.

Let's break down the times into seconds for easier comparison:

- **Red Ball:**  
  1 minute and 23 seconds is equivalent to \(1 \times 60 + 23 = 83\) seconds.

- **Blue Ball:**  
  29 seconds.

The red ball rolled for 83 seconds, while the blue ball rolled for only 29 seconds. Since the red ball rolled for a longer period, it would have had the opportunity to travel a farther distance compared to the blue ball. Therefore, the red ball rolled the farthest.

**Conclusion:** The red ball, rolling for 83 seconds, went farther than the blue ball, which rolled for only 29 seconds.

**Question:** Both a race car and a pickup were traveling at the same speed on the highway. The driver of the race car got tired and parked after 15 minutes, while the pickup's driver continued driving for another 15 minutes. Which vehicle eventually traveled a greater distance?

**Option 1:** Race car  
**Option 2:** Pickup

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine which vehicle traveled a greater distance, we need to analyze their travel times since they are both moving at the same speed.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the speed of both vehicles be \( v \) kilometers per hour.
   - Let the time the race car traveled be 15 minutes.

2. **Convert the Time to Hours:**
   - The race car traveled for 15 minutes which is equivalent to \(\frac{15}{60} = 0.25\) hours.
   - The pickup truck traveled for 15 minutes more than the race car, so it traveled for \( 15 + 15 = 30 \) minutes, which is equivalent to \(\frac{30}{60} = 0.5\) hours.

3. **Calculate the Distance Traveled:**
   - The distance traveled by the race car in 0.25 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Distance by race car} = v \times 0.25 = 0.25v \text{ kilometers}
     \]
   - The distance traveled by the pickup in 0.5 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Distance by pickup} = v \times 0.5 = 0.5v \text{ kilometers}
     \]

4. **Compare the Distances:**
   - From the calculations, \( 0.5v > 0.25v \).

Since the pickup traveled for a longer time, it traveled a greater distance.

**Question:**
If a skater rides at a speed of 34 meters/second in a field and 22 meters/second in a skate park, it means that which is rougher?

**Option 1:** Skate Park  
**Option 2:** Field

### Solution:

To determine which surface is rougher, we need to understand the relationship between speed and surface roughness. Generally, a smoother surface allows for higher speeds, while a rougher surface decreases speed due to increased friction.

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Speed in the Field:** The skater has a speed of 34 meters/second in the field.
2. **Speed in the Skate Park:** The skater has a speed of 22 meters/second in the skate park.

The skater moves faster in the field compared to the skate park, as the speed in the field (34 m/s) is greater than the speed in the skate park (22 m/s).

3. **Interpretation of Speeds:**
   - **Higher Speed (Field):** Indicates less resistance due to a smoother surface.
   - **Lower Speed (Skate Park):** Indicates more resistance, suggesting a rougher surface.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Because the skater moves slower in the skate park, it implies that the skate park is rougher than the field.

Therefore, based on the speeds provided and the relationship between speed and surface roughness, we can conclude that the skate park is rougher.

### Question:
The diameter of a strand of hair is 0.06 mm, whereas the diameter of a rope is 11 mm. Therefore, hair is?

### Options:
- Option 1: Stronger
- Option 2: Weaker

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to compare the diameters of a strand of hair and a rope to determine which is inherently stronger based on diameter. Generally, strength in contexts like ropes and strands is often associated with the diameter, where greater diameter suggests greater strength.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Comparison of Diameters:**

   - Diameter of hair = 0.06 mm
   - Diameter of rope = 11 mm

2. **Understanding the Context:**

   - In general, the physical strength of an object (such as its ability to withstand tension or pressure) is related to its size, particularly its diameter in the case of cylindrical objects like ropes and strands.
   - A larger diameter typically implies a greater cross-sectional area, which usually results in higher strength since it can distribute applied forces over a larger area.

3. **Application of Strength Principle:**

   - The rope, having a diameter of 11 mm, is significantly thicker than the hair which has a diameter of 0.06 mm.
   - Consequently, the rope, due to its larger diameter, would naturally support greater tension or force and is hence considered stronger compared to the strand of hair.

Therefore, given that the rope is larger in diameter than the hair, it follows the general principle that objects with larger diameters are stronger.

**Conclusion**: Based on the diameters provided, the strand of hair is weaker than the rope.

**Question:**  
Stanley and Kyle are driving their cars at a speed of 40 miles per hour. Stanley stops his car to answer his phone while Kyle continues driving. Who covers the least distance?

**Options:**  
Option 1: Stanley  
Option 2: Kyle

## Step-by-Step Solution with Explanation

1. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - Both Stanley and Kyle start driving at the same speed of 40 miles per hour.
   - Stanley pauses his journey to take a phone call, while Kyle continues driving without stopping.
   
2. **Implications of Stopping:**

   - Kyle, meanwhile, maintains his speed of 40 miles per hour, continuously covering more distance.

3. **Analyzing Distance Covered:**
   - Given that Kyle is continuously driving at a steady speed and Stanley stops, even for a short period, Kyle will travel a greater distance during the time that Stanley is stationary.
   - To find out who covers the least distance, we compare the scenarios where:
     - **Stanley** stops and may drive for a shorter total time period.

**Question:**  
The old tree's trunk width is 5.1 inches, and the new tree's trunk thickness is 10 cm. Therefore, the old tree was comparatively?

**Option 1:** A strong tree  
**Option 2:** A weak tree

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Convert Measurements to a Common Unit:**

   To compare the width of the trunks, we need to convert both measurements to the same unit. Let's convert both to centimeters.

   - The old tree's trunk width: 5.1 inches.  
     Using the conversion factor, 1 inch = 2.54 cm,  
     Width in cm = 5.1 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 12.954 cm.

   - The new tree's trunk thickness is given as 10 cm.

2. **Compare the Two Measurements:**

   - Old tree's trunk width: 12.954 cm.
   - New tree's trunk thickness: 10 cm.

   Since 12.954 cm (old tree) is greater than 10 cm (new tree), the old tree's trunk is wider.

3. **Conclusion:**

   A wider trunk generally indicates a stronger and more mature tree, as it can support more weight and withstand environmental stress better. Therefore, the old tree, with a width of 12.954 cm compared to the new tree's 10 cm, was comparatively a stronger tree.

**Question:**  
The mammoth was moving at a speed of 18 km per hour through water bogs, but it moved at a speed of 27 km per hour on firm soil because the firm soil was?  

**Options:**  
1. Less resistant  
2. More resistant  

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Scenario:**  
   - The problem describes two different terrains through which the mammoth is moving: water bogs and firm soil.
   - The speed of the mammoth in these terrains is given:
     - In water bogs: 18 km/h
     - On firm soil: 27 km/h

2. **Speed and Resistance Relationship:**  
   - Generally, speed is inversely related to the resistance offered by the medium. This means:
     - **Higher resistance** leads to **lower speed**.
     - **Lower resistance** leads to **higher speed**.

3. **Analysis of the Given Speeds:**  
   - In water bogs, the mammoth's speed is 18 km/h, which is lower compared to its speed on firm soil.
   - On firm soil, the mammoth's speed increases to 27 km/h.

4. **Inference Based on Speed Differences:**
   - Since the mammoth moves faster on firm soil (27 km/h) compared to on water bogs (18 km/h), it can be inferred that firm soil offers **less resistance** than water bogs.
   - Conversely, if firm soil were more resistant, the mammoth would move slower on it compared to water bogs.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - The increase in speed on the firm soil indicates that the firm soil is less resistant, allowing the mammoth to move faster.

Therefore, the correct option is **""Option 1: কম প্রতিরোধী""**, which translates to **""Option 1: Less resistant""**.

**Question:**  
Tina and Mina are both driving on the highway at the same speed. Tina drives for 129 minutes and Mina drives for 36 minutes and 48 seconds. Who drives a longer distance?

**Option 1:** Mina  
**Option 2:** Tina

## Detailed Solution

Since both Tina and Mina are driving at the same speed, the distance each of them drives is directly proportional to the time they spend driving. Therefore, the person who drives for a longer time will cover a greater distance.

**Step 1: Convert driving times to a uniform unit (seconds).**

Let's convert both Tina's and Mina's driving times into seconds for easy comparison.

- **Tina's driving time:**
  \[
  129 \text{ minutes} = 129 \times 60 = 7740 \text{ seconds}
  \]

- **Mina's driving time:**
  \[
  36 \text{ minutes and } 48 \text{ seconds} = (36 \times 60) + 48 = 2160 + 48 = 2208 \text{ seconds}
  \]

**Step 2: Compare driving times in seconds.**

- **Tina's time:** \(7740 \text{ seconds}\)
- **Mina's time:** \(2208 \text{ seconds}\)

Since 7740 seconds is greater than 2208 seconds, it is clear that Tina drives for a longer duration than Mina.

**Conclusion:**

Thus, because time spent driving at a constant speed determines the distance covered and Tina spends more time driving, Tina drives the longer distance.

   - Question: Mahir's weight is 678 Newtons, whereas his friend Musa's weight is 852 Newtons. Who is more likely to have a greater mass?
   - Option 1: Mahir
   - Option 2: Musa

2. **Solution:**

   To compare the mass of Mahir and Musa, we first need to understand the relationship between weight and mass. The weight of an object is the force exerted by gravity on that object and is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Weight (W)} = \text{Mass (m)} \times \text{Acceleration due to gravity (g)}
   \]

   In most of the world, the standard acceleration due to gravity \( g \) is approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

   Therefore, we can express the mass as:

   \[
   \text{Mass (m)} = \frac{\text{Weight (W)}}{\text{Acceleration due to gravity (g)}}
   \]

   Now, let's calculate the mass of each individual:

   **Mahir:**

   \[
   m_{\text{Mahir}} = \frac{678 \, \text{N}}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} \approx 69.18 \, \text{kg}
   \]

   **Musa:**

   \[
   m_{\text{Musa}} = \frac{852 \, \text{N}}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} \approx 86.94 \, \text{kg}
   \]

   Comparing the two masses, it's evident that Musa has a greater mass than Mahir.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Musa is more likely to have a greater mass.

**Question:**  
Ayesha's and Kamal's homes are 1 km and 600 meters away from our school, respectively. Today, Ayesha and Kamal took 20 minutes and 12 minutes, respectively, to reach the school from their homes. Let's see if they arrived at the same time.

**Options:**  
Option 1: They arrived at the same time.  
Option 2: They did not arrive at the same time.

## Solution:

To find out if Ayesha and Kamal arrived at the school at the same time, we need to compare their speeds while traveling to the school.

1. **Convert distances to meters for consistency:**
   - Ayesha's distance: 1 km = 1000 meters
   - Kamal's distance: 600 meters (already in meters)

2. **Convert times to seconds for consistent unit analysis:**
   - Ayesha's time: 20 minutes = 20 × 60 = 1200 seconds
   - Kamal's time: 12 minutes = 12 × 60 = 720 seconds

3. **Calculate their speeds:**
   - Ayesha's speed = Distance / Time = 1000 meters / 1200 seconds = 5/6 meters/second
   - Kamal's speed = Distance / Time = 600 meters / 720 seconds = 5/6 meters/second

4. **Compare their speeds:**
   - Both Ayesha and Kamal have a speed of 5/6 meters/second.

Since both Ayesha and Kamal traveled with the same speed over their respective distances, it implies that they cover their distances at the same rate. However, to determine if they arrived at the same time, we need to check when they started their journey since the problem provides their total time taken, not a commencement time.

Since the question states that they took different amounts of time (20 minutes for Ayesha and 12 minutes for Kamal) despite having the same speed, they did not start simultaneously; therefore, they did not arrive at the school at the same time.

**Conclusion:**
Ayesha and Kamal do not arrive at the same time at school.

### Question:
A swimmer crosses a lake in 12 minutes and crosses wet mud in 31 minutes because _____ is smoother.

### Options:
1. Lake
2. Wet Mud

## Solution:

To determine which surface is smoother, we need to understand the relationship between the surface smoothness and the time taken for a swimmer to cross it. A smoother surface generally allows faster movement, meaning less time is required to cross it.

- **Crossing a Lake in 12 Minutes:** 
  The swimmer crosses the lake relatively quickly, indicating that the swimmer can glide through the water smoothly and efficiently.

- **Crossing Wet Mud in 31 Minutes:** 
  The swimmer takes significantly longer to cross the wet mud, which suggests that the resistance is higher, making the movement slow and arduous.

Given the context:

- A lake is a body of water, providing minimal resistance to the swimmer, allowing for a quicker crossing.
- Wet mud offers more friction and resistance than water, leading to slower movement and a longer time to traverse.

Therefore, the lake is the smoother surface because it allows the swimmer to cross in less time compared to the wet mud.

## Conclusion:

The correct option is the one indicating the lake is smoother, as it facilitates faster crossing.

The weight of a sedan is 3351 pounds, and a garbage truck weighs 64000 pounds. When the traffic light turns green, both vehicles accelerate to a speed of 50 miles per hour. Which vehicle will win the race?

**Options:**
- Option 1: Sedan
- Option 2: Garbage Truck

### Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Both vehicles start from rest when the traffic light turns green.
   - Each vehicle accelerates to reach a speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - We need to determine which vehicle will reach this speed first, assuming they travel over the same distance.

2. **Key Factors:**
   - The primary factor affecting the acceleration is the relationship between force (produced by the engine) and the mass of the vehicle.
   - Newton's Second Law of Motion states: \( F = ma \) (force equals mass times acceleration).
   - Assuming both vehicles have similar engines or capability to produce sufficient power, the vehicle with the lower mass will generally accelerate faster because less force is needed to achieve the same acceleration.

3. **Comparing Masses:**
   - Sedan's weight = 3351 pounds.
   - Garbage truck's weight = 64000 pounds.
   - The sedan is significantly lighter than the garbage truck.

4. **Acceleration Consideration:**
   - With a lighter mass, the sedan requires less force to accelerate, which typically results in faster acceleration.
   - Therefore, under the assumption that both engines can produce comparable force, or both vehicles are designed to quickly reach 50 mph, the sedan, due to its much lighter weight, will likely reach the speed of 50 miles per hour before the garbage truck.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given these considerations, the sedan is expected to reach 50 miles per hour more quickly than the garbage truck.

### Question:
Beauty Queen was able to walk on the marble floor at a speed of 13 meters/second but on the wooden floor at a speed of 9 meters/second. What was the reason?

### Options:
- Option 1: More resistance
- Option 2: Less resistance

## Solution

The problem describes two different scenarios where Beauty Queen walks on different surfaces: a marble floor and a wooden floor. Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Marble Floor:** 
   - Speed = 13 meters/second
   - Marble floors are typically smooth and offer less friction and resistance, which allows for faster movement. 

2. **Wooden Floor:**
   - Speed = 9 meters/second
   - Wooden floors, compared to marble, may provide more friction and hence more resistance because of their texture and material properties.

To determine the reason for the difference in walking speeds, we relate speed with resistance (friction):

- **Friction and Resistance:** Higher resistance (more friction) on a surface slows down movement, while lower resistance (less friction) allows for faster movement.
- Since Beauty Queen walks faster on the marble floor (13 m/s) than on the wooden floor (9 m/s), the implication is that the marble floor offers **less resistance** compared to the wooden floor.

Therefore, the slower speed on the wooden floor suggests it has higher resistance due to more friction.

## Conclusion
The correct reasoning explains her slower speed on the wooden floor due to more resistance. Thus, the correct option is **""More resistance""**.

**Question:** A cat moves through a river at a speed of 5 m/s and through a jungle at a speed of 9.89 m/s. Where does the cat face less resistance?

**Option 1:** Jungle  
**Option 2:** River

## Solution

The problem asks us to determine where the cat encounters less resistance based on the speed at which it travels through different environments: a river and a jungle.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Resistance and Speed:**  
   - An object (or animal) typically moves faster when there is less resistance. This is because resistance (such as friction, water drag, etc.) slows down movement. Conversely, if an object is moving slowly, it likely encounters more resistance.

2. **Comparing Speeds through Different Mediums:**  
   - In the river, the cat moves at a speed of 5 meters per second (m/s).
   - In the jungle, the cat moves at a speed of 9.89 meters per second (m/s).

3. **Interpreting the Speeds:**
   - The cat's speed in the jungle is significantly higher than its speed in the river. A speed of 9.89 m/s in the jungle compared to only 5 m/s in the river suggests that the cat faces less resistance in the jungle because it can move faster.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the cat moves faster through the jungle, this indicates it faces less resistance compared to moving through the river, where it moves more slowly.

Therefore, the answer based on the given information is:

**Question:** What do you think you will hear more clearly?  
**Option 1:** A helicopter flying 154 feet away  
**Option 2:** A helicopter flying 62 meters away  

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine which helicopter you will hear more clearly, we need to consider the distances provided in both options. Since they are in different units, we'll first convert these measurements into a common unit for easy comparison. I'll use meters because the metric system is universally preferred for scientific calculations.

1. **Convert feet to meters** (since we know the option 2 distance in meters):
   - 1 foot is approximately 0.3048 meters.
   - Convert 154 feet to meters:
     \[
     154 \text{ feet} \times 0.3048 \text{ meters/foot} = 46.9382 \text{ meters} 
     \]
   - Therefore, 154 feet is approximately 46.94 meters.

2. **Compare the Distances:**
   - Option 1: 46.94 meters
   - Option 2: 62 meters

Since sound generally follows an inverse square law and diminishes with distance, a closer distance means a louder perception of sound. Between two distances, 46.94 meters is less than 62 meters. Thus, the helicopter that is 46.94 meters away (Option 1) will be easier to hear than the one that is 62 meters away (Option 2).

## Conclusion:
The helicopter in Option 1 is closer, so you would hear it more clearly.

**Question:**  
A small boy rolled his two rubber balls down the hallway. The red ball stopped after 1 minute. The blue one stopped after 57 seconds. Which one rolled the farthest?

**Option 1:** Red ball  
**Option 2:** Blue ball  

## Solution

To determine which ball rolled the farthest, we must compare the duration each ball rolled because typically, the longer a ball rolls, the farther it travels, assuming constant conditions such as surface smoothness and no significant external interruptions.

1. **Red Ball:** Stopped after 1 minute.
   - 1 minute is equivalent to 60 seconds.

2. **Blue Ball:** Stopped after 57 seconds.

By comparing the time durations:
- The red ball rolled for 60 seconds.
- The blue ball rolled for 57 seconds.

Since 60 seconds (red ball) is greater than 57 seconds (blue ball), the red ball rolled for a longer period of time.

Assuming that both balls started with a similar initial velocity and encountered similar rolling resistance, the red ball, having rolled for longer, would typically cover more distance than the blue ball.

Therefore, the red ball must have rolled the farthest.

**Question:** A pickup truck and a van are both traveling on the highway at 60 miles per hour. If the pickup continues in the direction of departure and the van stops quickly, which vehicle will cover a shorter distance?

**Option 1:** Pickup  
**Option 2:** Van

## Solution

To solve this problem, we must analyze the scenario provided:

1. **Pickup Truck:** 
   - It continues to travel at 60 miles per hour in the direction of departure. 
   - This implies that as long as it keeps traveling without stopping, it will keep covering more distance.

2. **Van:**
   - It stops quickly, meaning it will cease covering any additional distance once it stops. 
   - Therefore, the distance it covers will be limited to the distance it traveled while moving at 60 miles per hour, up until it made the quick stop.

**Conclusion:**

- Since the pickup truck continues to travel without stopping, it will inherently cover more distance over time.
- The van, on the other hand, because it stops quickly, will cover less distance compared to a vehicle that continues to travel at a constant speed.

### Question:
Jarina observed that rolling the pencil on gravel produces 49 Joules of heat, while rolling it on a carpet produces 31 Joules of heat. Where does the pencil experience more resistance?

### Options:
- Option 1: Carpet
- Option 2: Gravel

## Solution:

The resistance experienced by an object rolling on a surface can often be inferred from the amount of heat generated. The heat produced is a result of friction, which is directly related to the resistance encountered by the object. Higher resistance leads to more friction, which in turn generates more heat.

1. **Heat Generated on Gravel:** 
   - The pencil produces 49 Joules of heat when rolled on gravel.

2. **Heat Generated on Carpet:** 
   - The pencil produces 31 Joules of heat when rolled on carpet.

3. **Comparison of Heat (Friction):**
   - The heat generated on gravel (49 Joules) is greater than the heat generated on the carpet (31 Joules).
   - Since more heat is produced on gravel, it indicates that there is more friction and, thus, more resistance.

Therefore, the pencil encounters more resistance when it is rolled on **gravel**.

### Question:
In the pond, a turtle's swimming speed is 5 m/s, whereas in the sea it is 2 m/s. Which one is smoother?

### Options:
- Option 1: Pond
- Option 2: Sea

## Solution:

To determine which environment is ""smoother"" based on the given swimming speeds, we need to interpret what ""smoother"" means in this context. Generally, a higher swimming speed indicates less resistance and hence a smoother environment for swimming. 

- In the pond, the turtle's speed is **5 m/s**.
- In the sea, the turtle's speed is **2 m/s**.

Since higher speed suggests less resistance and a more ""satisfactory"" swimming environment:

1. **Pond**: The turtle swims at 5 m/s, which is faster. This implies that the water in the pond provides less resistance, making it a smoother environment for the turtle to swim in.
2. **Sea**: The turtle swims at only 2 m/s, indicating more resistance and a less smooth environment.

Given this reasoning, the pond, where the turtle swims faster, should be considered the smoother environment.

**Question:**
Jasper is taking his niece to the park. Then it's her nephew's turn. His niece is five years older, and her weight is 21 kg, whereas his nephew's weight is 24 kg. Who has a greater gravitational pull?

**Options:**
- Option 1: Niece
- Option 2: Nephew

### Solution:

To determine who has a greater gravitational pull, we need to compare the weights of the niece and the nephew. The gravitational pull that an object exerts or experiences is directly proportional to its mass (or weight, assuming the same location on Earth where gravity is constant).

- **Niece's weight:** 21 kg
- **Nephew's weight:** 24 kg

Since the gravitational pull is directly related to the weight of the object:

- The gravitational pull of the niece, due to her weight of 21 kg, would be less than that of the nephew, who weighs 24 kg.

### Conclusion:

Given that the nephew weighs more than the niece, he has a greater gravitational pull.

A hand can move through 200 centimeters of water in 12 seconds and can move 2 meters through air in 7 seconds. Where is there less friction?

#### Option 1: Water
#### Option 2: Air

### Solution Explained in English:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine where there is less friction by comparing the time taken to move a certain distance in water versus air.

2. **Convert the Units for Easy Comparison:**
   - **In Water:**
     - Distance = 200 centimeters = 2 meters (since 100 cm = 1 m)
     - Time = 12 seconds
     - Speed in water = Distance / Time = 2 meters / 12 seconds = 1/6 meters per second

   - **In Air:**
     - Distance = 2 meters
     - Time = 7 seconds
     - Speed in air = Distance / Time = 2 meters / 7 seconds ≈ 0.2857 meters per second

3. **Compare Speeds:**
   - Speed in water (1/6 meters per second) is approximately 0.1667 meters per second.
   - Speed in air is approximately 0.2857 meters per second.

4. **Determine Where There is Less Friction:**
   - The hand moves faster through air (0.2857 m/s) than through water (0.1667 m/s).
   - Faster speed indicates less resistance or friction, as the hand takes less time to cover the same distance.

Therefore, there is less friction when moving through air.

**Question:** A cheetah runs at a speed of 45 km/h, while a dog runs at a speed of 2 km/h. So, how much time will the cheetah take?

**Option 1:** Less time  
**Option 2:** More time

## Detailed Solution:

To determine how much time the cheetah will take relative to the dog, we must understand that:

1. **Speed and Time Relationship**: The time taken to cover a certain distance is inversely proportional to the speed when the distance remains constant. Mathematically, this is represented as:

   \[
   \text{Time} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

2. **Comparison of Speeds**:
   - Cheetah's speed = 45 km/h
   - Dog's speed = 2 km/h

   The cheetah runs at a significantly higher speed than the dog.

3. **Time Calculation**: If both the cheetah and the dog were to cover the same distance, the time taken by each would be calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

   Since we are only comparing relative times for the same distance, let's denote the time taken by the cheetah as \( T_c \) and by the dog as \( T_d \).

   - For the same distance \( D \):
     \[
     T_c = \frac{D}{45}
     \]
     \[
     T_d = \frac{D}{2}
     \]

4. **Comparison of Times**: From the equations above, it is clear that:

   \[
   T_c = \frac{D}{45}, \quad T_d = \frac{D}{2}
   \]

   Since 45 > 2, \( \frac{1}{45} < \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, \( T_c < T_d \).

Hence, the cheetah will take **less time** compared to the dog to cover the same distance, given its higher speed.

**Question:**
A volleyball player jumped 3 meters on the gym floor but only 1.2 meters on the sand by the seashore. Why was this?

**Option 1:** More resistant  
**Option 2:** Less resistant

## Solution:

To solve the problem, we need to understand the difference in the surfaces on which the volleyball player is jumping:

1. **Nature of Surfaces:**
   - **Gym Floor:** Usually made of hard materials like wood or synthetic substances. It is a firm and stable surface, which means it provides minimal resistance to the jump. The player's legs can exert force effectively, allowing a higher jump.
   - **Sandy Beach:** Sand is a loose, shifting surface. When a player jumps on sand, the sand gives way under their feet. This results in energy being absorbed by the sand instead of being utilized for the jump. Consequently, the player cannot jump as high on sand.

2. **Resistance Explanation:**
   - **High Resistance Surface** (like sand) absorbs more of the jump's energy, reducing the height the player can achieve. Hence, the player jumps only 1.2 meters.
   - **Low Resistance Surface** (like the gym floor) retains more of the jump's energy, enabling a higher jump of 3 meters.

Based on this reasoning, the reason the player jumped a shorter distance on sand is because sand is a more resistant surface compared to the gym floor.

## Conclusion:

The correct option indicating why the player could not jump as high on sand due to resistance is:

**Question**: Lisa was playing with two models of rockets. When she launched both rockets simultaneously into the sky, after 30 seconds, the black one was 30 meters above the ground, and the red one was 18 meters above the ground. Which one had a higher speed?

**Option 1**: The red one.
**Option 2**: The black one.

## Solution:

To determine which rocket had a higher speed, we need to consider the distance each rocket covered from the ground and the time taken, which is 30 seconds.

**Step 1: Calculate the speed of the black rocket**

- Distance covered by the black rocket = 30 meters
- Time taken = 30 seconds

Using the formula for speed: 

\[
\text{Speed of the black rocket} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{30 \text{ meters}}{30 \text{ seconds}} = 1 \text{ meter/second}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the speed of the red rocket**

- Distance covered by the red rocket = 18 meters
- Time taken = 30 seconds

Using the formula for speed:

\[
\text{Speed of the red rocket} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{18 \text{ meters}}{30 \text{ seconds}} = 0.6 \text{ meters/second}
\]

**Comparison:**

- Speed of the black rocket = 1 meter/second
- Speed of the red rocket = 0.6 meters/second

The black rocket traveled at 1 meter/second, while the red one traveled at 0.6 meters/second. Clearly, the speed of the black rocket is higher than that of the red rocket.

**Conclusion:**

Since the speed of the black rocket is greater than that of the red rocket, the black rocket had a higher speed.

### Question:
An agate rolls at a speed of 38 cm/second in a muddy field and rolls at a speed of 125 cm/second in an empty cave. Where will the agate roll further?

### Options:
- **Option 1:** Muddy Field
- **Option 2:** Empty Cave

## Step-by-Step Solution and Explanation

To determine where the agate will roll further, let's analyze the information given:

1. **Speed of the Agate:**
   - In the **muddy field**, the agate rolls at a speed of 38 cm/second.
   - In the **empty cave**, the agate rolls at a speed of 125 cm/second.

2. **Assuming Equal Duration:**
   - If the agate rolls for the same duration in both the environments, the distance it covers can be calculated by using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   
3. **Comparison of Distances:**
   - **In the muddy field:** 
     - Suppose it rolls for `t` seconds, then the distance covered \( D_1 \) is:
       \[
       D_1 = 38 \times t
       \]
   - **In the empty cave:** 
     - Suppose it rolls for the same duration `t`, then the distance covered \( D_2 \) is:
       \[
       D_2 = 125 \times t
       \]

4. **Distance Analysis:**
   - Since \( 125 > 38 \), it is evident that for the same amount of time, the agate covers more distance in the empty cave than in the muddy field.
   - Therefore, the agate will roll further in the empty cave.

Ultimately, we are comparing two environments with differing resistances, and given that the speed in the empty cave is greater, the agate will inevitably roll further in the empty cave compared to the muddy field.

## Conclusion

The agate will roll further in the environment where it has the higher speed. Thus, the correct option is:

**Question:**
Mary's skiff is able to cover a distance of 10 miles in the bay before running out of fuel, compared to 4 miles in the open sea. This means that _____ is rougher?

**Option 1:** The bay  
**Option 2:** The open sea

## Solution:

To determine which of the two environments — the bay or the open sea — is rougher, we must consider how the distance covered before fuel runs out reflects the skiff's performance in different conditions.

- **Distance in the Bay:** 10 miles
- **Distance in the Open Sea:** 4 miles

A skiff or boat will consume more fuel and cover less distance in rougher conditions because it has to work harder against the elements such as waves, currents, and potentially wind. In the open sea, Mary’s skiff is only able to travel 4 miles before running out of fuel, whereas in the bay, it can travel 10 miles.

This discrepancy can be attributed to the conditions being rougher in the open sea, leading to higher fuel consumption due to increased resistance. Conversely, the bay is likely calmer and more sheltered, allowing for a longer distance on the same amount of fuel.

Therefore, the open sea requires more energy to navigate due to the rougher conditions.

## Conclusion:

Based on the evidence, the open sea is indeed rougher, causing higher fuel consumption and shorter travel distances for Mary’s skiff.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The swimmer moves across two different surfaces: a lake and wet mud. It takes him less time to cross the lake compared to the time to cross the wet mud. We need to determine which of these surfaces is smoother based on the time taken to cross each.

2. **Analyzing Smoothness and Time**: In general, a surface that is smoother allows for faster movement because there is less resistance. Therefore, a surface that is crossed more quickly is typically smoother.

3. **Comparing the Surfaces**:
    - The swimmer crosses the lake in 1 minute.
    - The swimmer crosses the wet mud in 3 minutes.

   Since the swimmer takes less time to cross the lake, it indicates that crossing the lake involves less resistance due to smoother characteristics compared to the wet mud.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, the lake must be smoother than the wet mud because the swimmer can cross it more quickly.

**Question:**
Jasper is taking his niece to the park. Then it's his nephew's turn. His niece is more than five years old and weighs 32 kilograms, while his nephew weighs 40 pounds 13 ounces. Who experiences more gravitational pull?

- **Option 1:** The niece
- **Option 2:** The nephew

## Solution:

To determine who experiences more gravitational pull, we need to compare their weights. Weight is directly related to gravitational pull: the heavier the person, the more gravitational pull they experience.

1. **Weight of the Niece:** 
   - The niece weighs 32 kilograms.

2. **Weight of the Nephew:** 
   - The nephew's weight is given as 40 pounds 13 ounces.
   - First, we convert the weight from pounds and ounces to kilograms for a fair comparison.

3. **Conversion from Pounds and Ounces to Kilograms:**
   - 1 pound is equivalent to 0.45359237 kilograms.
   - 1 ounce is 1/16 of a pound, which means an ounce is equivalent to 0.45359237 / 16 = 0.028349523 kilograms.

   - Convert the nephew's weight:
     \[
     40 \text{ pounds} = 40 \times 0.45359237 \text{ kg} = 18.1436948 \text{ kg}
     \]
     \[
     13 \text{ ounces} = 13 \times 0.028349523 \text{ kg} = 0.368543799 \text{ kg}
     \]

   - Total weight of the nephew in kilograms:
     \[
     18.1436948 \text{ kg} + 0.368543799 \text{ kg} = 18.512238599 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Comparison:**

   - Niece's weight: 32 kg
   - Nephew's weight: approximately 18.51 kg

Since 32 kg (the weight of the niece) is greater than approximately 18.51 kg (the weight of the nephew), the niece experiences a greater gravitational pull.

**Conclusion:**

The niece, weighing more in kilograms, experiences greater gravitational pull than the nephew.

### Question:
Doug travels from his house to his friend's house on his bicycle and covers 7 miles in an hour. When he travels the same distance by walking, he covers 2 miles in an hour. How does Doug reach his friend's house more quickly?

### Options:
1. Walking
2. Cycling

## Solution:

To determine how Doug can reach his friend's house more quickly, we need to compare the time it takes for each mode of transportation over the same distance.

### Analysis:

- **Cycling:**
  - Speed while cycling = 7 miles per hour.

- **Walking:**
  - Speed while walking = 2 miles per hour.

Let's assume the distance between Doug's house and his friend's house is \( D \) miles.

#### Time Calculations:

- **Time taken by cycling**: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{D}{7} \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Time taken by walking**: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{D}{2} \text{ hours}
  \]

Since Doug wants to reach his friend's house more quickly, we need to find out which time is shorter.

We compare \(\frac{D}{7}\) and \(\frac{D}{2}\):

- If we set \( D \) to a concrete value to simplify comparison, the relationship remains consistent because we are interested in comparing the formula, not the actual calculation with specific values.
- It is evident that \(\frac{D}{7} < \frac{D}{2}\) since \(7 > 2\).

This inequality shows that cycling takes less time compared to walking for covering the same distance.

Thus, Doug reaches his friend's house more quickly by cycling.

The mammoth traveled at a speed of 3 km/h through the watering hole, but it traveled at a speed of 9 km/h on the solid dirt because the solid dirt was?

### Options:
1. Less resistant
2. More resistant

## Solution:

In the scenario, we are comparing the travel speeds of the mammoth over two different terrains: a watering hole and solid dirt.

- **Watering hole:** The mammoth travels at a speed of 3 km/h.
- **Solid dirt:** The mammoth travels at a speed of 9 km/h.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding Resistance:**
   - **Resistance** in this context refers to how the surface or medium affects the ease or difficulty of movement. A surface offering **less resistance** would allow for easier and faster travel, whereas one with **more resistance** would slow the traveler down.

2. **Comparison:**
   - In the watering hole, the slower speed of 3 km/h suggests that the medium is more difficult to traverse, implying greater resistance from the water and muddy conditions.
   - On the solid dirt, the faster speed of 9 km/h indicates that the surface provides less resistance, making it easier and faster for the mammoth to move.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The solid dirt allows the mammoth to travel faster, indicating that it offers **less resistance** compared to the watering hole.

Therefore, the correct reason why the mammoth traveled at a higher speed on solid dirt is because the solid dirt was **less resistant**.

**Question:**
A group of turtles travels 20 centimeters in 1 second in a pond, whereas they travel 8 meters in 2 seconds in the sea. Which is smoother?

**Option 1:** Pond  
**Option 2:** Sea  

## Detailed Solution

To determine which situation involves smoother movement, we need to calculate the speed of the turtles in both the pond and the sea. This will help us understand in which environment the turtles are moving more consistently in terms of speed.

### Step 1: Calculate the Speed in the Pond

- The turtles travel 20 centimeters in 1 second in the pond.
- We can keep this measurement in centimeters per second:
  \[
  \text{Speed in the pond} = 20 \text{ cm/s}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Speed in the Sea

- The turtles travel 8 meters in 2 seconds in the sea.
- First, convert meters to centimeters for consistency:
  \[
  8 \text{ meters} = 800 \text{ centimeters}
  \]
- Now, calculate the speed in centimeters per second:
  \[
  \text{Speed in the sea} = \frac{800 \text{ cm}}{2 \text{ s}} = 400 \text{ cm/s}
  \]

### Step 3: Compare the Speeds

- Speed in the pond is 20 cm/s.
- Speed in the sea is 400 cm/s.

### Step 4: Analyze Smoothness

- Typically, a higher speed can imply a less smooth travel if not controlled, but in this context, ""smoothness"" refers to the rapidity and evenness with which the turtles can cover distances. A higher consistent speed indicates smoother traversal over time if without interruptions.

- The speed in the sea is significantly higher (400 cm/s) compared to the pond (20 cm/s). This suggests that the turtles travel more smoothly in the sea, covering more distance in less time.

## Conclusion

**Question**: Ian and Avery are catching trains from the same station. Ian's train is red and is going at a speed of 9 km per hour to a destination 40 miles away. Avery's train is green and is going at a speed of 23 km per hour to a destination 40 miles away. Which train has a higher speed?

**Option 1**: Red  
**Option 2**: Green

## Solution:

To compare the speeds of Ian's and Avery's trains, we need to ensure both speeds are in the same unit. Currently, the speed of Ian's train is given in kilometers per hour (km/h), and the speed of Avery's train is also in kilometers per hour.

1. **Ian's Train:**
   - Speed = 9 km/h

2. **Avery's Train:**
   - Speed = 23 km/h

Both speeds are given in kilometers per hour, so it is straightforward to compare them without any conversion.

3. **Comparison:**

   - Ian's Train Speed: 9 km/h
   - Avery's Train Speed: 23 km/h

From the values above, it's clear that Avery's train, which is traveling at 23 km/h, is faster than Ian's train, which is traveling at 9 km/h.

## Conclusion:

Avery's train, which is the green train, has the higher speed.

**Problem:**
Teri travels on her bicycle, first at a speed of 560 cm/s through a grassy field, and then at a speed of 12 m/s on a paved road. The paved road was?

**Options:**
1. Less resistant
2. Less resistant

### Solution:

To determine which surface is less resistant, we need to consider the speed Teri travels on each surface. Typically, the less resistant the surface, the faster a cyclist can travel on it. 

First, let's convert all speeds to the same unit for comparison. We'll convert 560 cm/s to meters per second since 1 meter = 100 centimeters.

- **Speed on grassy field**: 560 cm/s = \( \frac{560}{100} \) m/s = 5.6 m/s.

- **Speed on paved road**: 12 m/s.

Now, we compare the two speeds:

- Speed on grassy field: 5.6 m/s
- Speed on paved road: 12 m/s

Observation: Teri travels faster on the paved road (12 m/s) than on the grassy field (5.6 m/s). Generally, a faster speed indicates lower resistance because there is less friction or obstacle slowing the cyclist down.

Therefore, the paved road provides less resistance compared to the grassy field.

Since the options provided are the same and are both ""Less resistant,"" the correct conclusion is:

### Question:
Jorina rubbed her pencil on various surfaces to see how much heat was generated. She observed that rubbing the pencil on gravel produced 81 joules of heat and 137 joules of heat when rubbed on a carpet. Where will the pencil move slower?

### Options:
- Option 1: Carpet
- Option 2: Gravel

## Detailed Solution

### Understanding the Problem:
When a pencil is rubbed on a surface, the friction between the pencil and the surface generates heat. The amount of heat generated is directly related to the frictional force. Higher frictional force implies more work done against this force, which thus generates more heat and typically results in slower movement of the object.

### Evaluating the Observations:
1. **Heat Generated on Carpet: 137 Joules**
2. **Heat Generated on Gravel: 81 Joules**

### Analysis:
- More heat is generated when the pencil is rubbed on the **carpet (137 Joules)** compared to **gravel (81 Joules)**.
- This indicates that the carpet surface has higher friction than the gravel surface.
- Higher friction means that there is more resistance to motion, which results in the pencil moving slower on the surface.

### Conclusion:
Since the pencil produces more heat—and thus experiences higher friction—when rubbed on the carpet, it will move more slowly on the carpet compared to the gravel.

**Question:** Mohsin is standing 40 cm away from a lantern and 89 cm away from a streetlight. Which source of light appears brighter to him?

**Option 1:** Lantern  
**Option 2:** Streetlight

## Step-by-Step Solution

To determine which light source appears brighter to Mohsin, we can apply the **Inverse Square Law for Light**, which states that the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. This means that the closer the light source, the brighter it will appear.

Formally, if \( I \) represents the intensity of light and \( d \) is the distance from the source, the relation is given by:

\[
I \propto \frac{1}{d^2}
\]

Let's calculate the intensity for both the lantern and the streetlight as perceived by Mohsin:

1. **For the Lantern:**
   - Distance, \( d_1 = 40 \) cm
   - Relative intensity, \( I_1 \propto \frac{1}{40^2} = \frac{1}{1600} \)

2. **For the Streetlight:**
   - Distance, \( d_2 = 89 \) cm
   - Relative intensity, \( I_2 \propto \frac{1}{89^2} = \frac{1}{7921} \)

Since the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the light source with the higher value of \(\frac{1}{d^2}\) will appear brighter.

Let's compare the two intensities:
- \(\frac{1}{1600}\) for Lantern
- \(\frac{1}{7921}\) for Streetlight

Since \(\frac{1}{1600}\) is greater than \(\frac{1}{7921}\), the lantern, which is closer, will appear brighter to Mohsin.

## Conclusion

Thus, the light source that appears brighter to Mohsin is the lantern.

### Question:
The ring of the team rotates 8.1 cm on the field and 3.2 cm on the floor. Which is smoother?

### Options:
- **Option 1:** Floor
- **Option 2:** Field

## Solution:

To determine which surface is smoother, we need to consider the distance the ring rotates on each surface, which could imply the ease with which the ring rolls. A smoother surface would generally allow the ring to roll a greater distance with less friction.

### Step-by-step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Distances:**
   - On the field, the ring rolls a distance of 8.1 cm.
   - On the floor, the ring rolls a distance of 3.2 cm.

2. **Analyzing the Smoothing Factor:**
   - Generally, a smoother surface will result in less resistance, thus allowing the ring to roll further. 
   - In this scenario, the ring rolls a greater distance (8.1 cm) on the field compared to the floor (3.2 cm).

3. **Conclusion on Smoothness:**
   - Since the ring rolls a longer distance on the field (8.1 cm) compared to the floor (3.2 cm), it suggests that the field has less friction or resistance, making it smoother than the floor.

Therefore, based on the distances provided and the inference that smoother surfaces allow for greater rolling distances, the field is the smoother surface.

**Question**: Sherry takes her ball under two lanes. The ball moves at a speed of 32 m/s in the red lane and 27 m/s in the green lane. Why is the speed of the ball higher in the red lane?

**Option 1**: More friction  
**Option 2**: Less friction

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Friction and Speed Relation**:
    - Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object. The greater the friction, the more resistance there is to motion, which tends to lower the speed of an object when other forces are constant.
    - Conversely, if there is less friction, the object encounters less resistance and can move faster.

2. **Comparative Analysis for the Lanes**:
    - In the problem, the ball moves faster in the red lane at a speed of 32 m/s compared to the green lane where it moves at 27 m/s.
    - Based on our understanding of friction, the lane with less friction will allow the ball to move faster because there is less opposition to its motion.

3. **Reason for Higher Speed in the Red Lane**:
    - Since the ball moves faster in the red lane, it encounters less friction compared to the green lane. Hence, less friction is the factor that allows the higher speed in the red lane.

4. **Choosing the Correct Option**:
    - By analyzing that less friction allows the ball to move faster, the reason why the ball moves faster in the red lane is due to less friction.

The correct answer is based on the principle that less friction results in higher speed.

**Question**: If the speed of a boat is 700 cm/second and the speed of a submarine is 4 cm/second, which vessel will take more time to complete the same journey?

**Option 1**: Boat
**Option 2**: Submarine

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine which vessel, the boat or the submarine, takes more time to travel the same distance.
   - The speed of the boat is 700 cm/second.
   - The speed of the submarine is 4 cm/second.

2. **Conceptual Approach**:
   - Time taken to travel a certain distance is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - For the same journey (i.e., the same distance), a lower speed means more time is required, and a higher speed means less time is needed.

3. **Comparing the Speeds**:
   - **Boat's Speed**: 700 cm/second
   - **Submarine's Speed**: 4 cm/second
   - The boat is substantially faster than the submarine.

4. **Logical Reasoning**:
   - Given that the boat travels at a speed of 700 cm/second and the submarine at 4 cm/second, the boat will complete the journey much faster than the submarine.
   - Therefore, the vessel with the slower speed (the submarine) will take a longer time to complete the same journey.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the speed of the submarine is much lower than that of the boat, the submarine will take more time to travel the same distance.

### Question:
Jason has noticed that his ATV (All-Terrain Vehicle) moves at 58 km/h on ice and at 39 km/h on sand. The ATV moves slower on sand because sand is _____?

### Options:
1. More resistant
2. Less resistant

## Detailed Solution:

ATVs, like other vehicles, experience various types of resistance from the surfaces they travel on. This resistance affects their speed. Let's analyze the scenario:

1. **Understanding Resistance:**
    - **Resistance** is generally a force that opposes motion, caused by friction between the vehicle's tires and the surface it is moving over.
    - The higher the resistance, the more energy is required for the vehicle to maintain its speed, leading to slower speeds.

2. **Comparing Surfaces:**
    - **Ice:** This surface typically provides very low resistance due to its slippery nature, which means there is less friction opposing the motion of the ATV. As a result, the ATV can move at a higher speed of 58 km/h.
    - **Sand:** Sand, especially loose or dry sand, provides significant resistance or friction, making it difficult for the ATV’s tires to maintain grip and momentum. This increased resistance slows down the ATV, resulting in a lower speed of 39 km/h.

3. **Conclusion based on Resistance:**
    - The ATV moves slower on sand not because there is less resistance, but because there is **more resistance** compared to ice. The sand's higher friction effectively ""drags"" on the tires more than ice does, causing the vehicle to lose speed.

Therefore, the reason Jason's ATV moves slower on sand is due to the greater resistance it encounters.

- **Question:** A little boy rolled his two rubber balls down the hallway. The red ball stopped after 70 seconds. The blue ball stopped after 2 minutes 34 seconds. Which one went farther?
- **Option 1:** Red ball
- **Option 2:** Blue ball

## Solution:
To determine which ball went farther, we need to compare the durations they were rolling, as the distance covered by an object in uniform motion is directly proportional to the time it is moving (assuming no significant differences in speed due to initial push or surface friction).

1. **Convert the times into the same unit for easy comparison:**
   - Time for the **red ball**: \(70\) seconds
   - Time for the **blue ball**: \(2 \text{ minutes } 34 \text{ seconds}\)

   First, convert the time for the blue ball from minutes and seconds into seconds:
   \[
   2 \text{ minutes } = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   Therefore, the total time for the blue ball is:
   \[
   120 \text{ seconds} + 34 \text{ seconds} = 154 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Compare the times:**
   - Red ball: \(70\) seconds
   - Blue ball: \(154\) seconds

   Since 154 seconds is greater than 70 seconds, the blue ball was in motion for a longer time.

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since both balls are assumed to roll under similar conditions, the ball that rolls for a longer duration typically travels a greater distance. Therefore, the blue ball, which rolled for 154 seconds, went farther than the red ball, which rolled for 70 seconds.

**Options:**
1. The cowboy traveled a shorter distance.
2. The hippie traveled a shorter distance.

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Walking Times:**
   - **Cowboy:**
     - Started walking at 6 AM.
     - Noon is 12 PM.
     - Total time walked by the cowboy = 12 PM - 6 AM = 6 hours.
   
   - **Hippie:**
     - Started walking at 8 AM.
     - Noon is 12 PM.
     - Total time walked by the hippie = 12 PM - 8 AM = 4 hours.

2. **Speed Calculation:**
   - Both are walking at the same speed (as per the problem).

3. **Distance Traveled:**
   - Distance is calculated by the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.
   - Since both are walking at the same speed, the distance traveled by each depends solely on the time they walked.
   
4. **Distance Comparison:**
   - **Cowboy's Distance:**
     - Walked for 6 hours at a constant speed.
   - **Hippie's Distance:**
     - Walked for 4 hours at the same constant speed.
   - Therefore, since time is directly proportional to distance (when speed is constant), the cowboy, having walked longer, covered a greater distance.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The hippie traveled a shorter distance compared to the cowboy.

Thus, based on the above reasoning, we conclude that:

Mark has observed that he can throw his lawn dart an average of about 8 meters into soft soil and 5 meters into sand. This means that _____ is smoother?

**Option 1:** Soft soil  
**Option 2:** Packed sand  

## Solution:

To understand the problem, we must consider the concept of how a surface affects the travel of a projectile, such as a lawn dart, after it is thrown.

1. **Definition of Smoothing in Context:**  
   - A ""smoother"" surface in this context implies that it offers less resistance when the dart makes contact with it. Therefore, the smoother the surface, the further the dart can travel upon impact.

2. **Observations from the Problem:**
   - Mark throws the lawn dart 8 meters into soft soil.
   - Mark throws the lawn dart 5 meters into sand.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The fact that the lawn dart travels 8 meters on soft soil versus 5 meters on sand suggests that the dart encounters less resistance, or can penetrate more easily, through soft soil than packed sand.
   - If the soft soil allows the dart to reach a distance greater than that achieved on sand, it indicates that the soil is the smoother option.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - Between soft soil and packed sand, the soft soil allows the dart to travel further, indicating that it offers less friction or resistance to the moving dart, making it the smoother surface in this context.

### Question:
A train conductor notices that he is traveling at a speed of 58 km/h on a track, whereas he is traveling at a speed of 39 km/h on the ground with wheels with the same amount of energy. Which was smoother?

### Options:
- **Option 1**: Track
- **Option 2**: Wheel

## Solution:

To determine which path is smoother, we need to consider the speed achieved with the same amount of energy. When traveling with the same energy input:

- A higher speed indicates less resistance and, therefore, a smoother path.
- A lower speed indicates more resistance and, therefore, a rougher path.

In this context:

- On the track, the train achieves a speed of 58 km/h.
- On the ground with wheels, the train achieves a speed of 39 km/h.

The train can travel faster on the track (58 km/h) than on the ground (39 km/h) with the same energy input, implying that the track provides less resistance compared to the ground with wheels. Lower resistance corresponds to a smoother path.

Therefore, the track is smoother than the wheels on the ground.

**Conclusion:**

Since the track allows the train to move at a higher speed with the same amount of energy, it is concluded that the track is smoother.

A city's fire chief has noticed that his fire engine can travel at a speed of 12 miles per hour on crowded roads and 7 miles per hour on open roads. Which road is smoother?

**Option 1:** Crowded Road  
**Option 2:** Open Road  

### Solution

To determine which road is smoother based on the given speeds, we need to interpret what ""smoother"" might imply in this context. The term ""smoother"" can be associated with the ease of travel or average speed that can be maintained on the road.

1. **Analyzing Speeds:**
   - **Crowded Road:** Speed = 12 miles per hour
   - **Open Road:** Speed = 7 miles per hour

2. **Reasoning:**
   - Generally, a higher travel speed indicates less obstruction and more efficiency in movement, implying that the road is ""smoother"" in terms of travel conditions.
   - In this problem, since the fire engine can travel faster on crowded roads (12 mph) compared to open roads (7 mph), it suggests that despite being labeled ""crowded,"" the road conditions (interms of traveling) are more favorable or ""smoother"" than the open roads.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the fire engine's speed is higher on the crowded road, this suggests that it is able to move more smoothly or efficiently compared to the open road.

Therefore, the crowded road is actually smoother in terms of the travel conditions for the fire engine.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert the Distances to the Same Unit:**
   - Bob's initial distance from the street lamp was 290 cm.
   - Bob's final distance from the street lamp is given as 15 meters.

   To compare these effectively, let's convert both distances into the same unit. We'll convert 15 meters to centimeters because the initial distance is given in centimeters.

   \[
   \text{15 meters} = 15 \times 100 = 1500 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Comparing the Distances:**
   - Initial distance from the street lamp: 290 cm
   - New distance from the street lamp: 1500 cm

3. **Understanding the Visual Effect:**
   The further away an object is, generally, the dimmer it appears because the intensity of light decreases with distance. This is due to the inverse square law of light, which states that light intensity decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the source.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Since Bob moved from a closer position (290 cm) to a farther position (1500 cm), the street lamp would appear dimmer due to the increased distance from the light source.

   - Since the planes travel at the same speed, the time taken is proportional to the distance traveled.

   - **Travel Duration Calculation Approach:**
     - Since they arrived simultaneously and Los Angeles is farther than Chicago, Easter, who started at 07:00 (1 hour earlier), presumably needed this extra hour to compensate for the longer distance and still arrive at the same time as Kevin, who departed later at 08:00.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Easter departed 1 hour earlier, indicating a longer journey time because the plane's speed is consistent for both and she had to cover a much greater distance to reach Los Angeles.

Therefore, despite starting earlier, the fact that both travelers arrive simultaneously means Easter's total travel time exceeds Kevin’s because her journey entails covering a much larger distance, which required her to depart earlier to ensure an equal arrival time.

   - **Question:** Dylan throws a pebble (which has a mass of 0.2 kg) and a basketball (which has a mass of 1 kg) out of the window. _____ experienced a stronger gravitational pull because it has more mass?
   
   - **Option 1:** Pebble
   
   - **Option 2:** Basketball

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   The gravitational force experienced by an object is determined by the formula:

   \[
   F = m \times g
   \]

   where:
   - \( F \) is the gravitational force,
   - \( m \) is the mass of the object,
   - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on the surface of the Earth).

   Let's examine the two objects:

   - For the pebble:
     - Mass (\( m \)) = 0.2 kg.
     - Gravitational force (\( F \)) = \( 0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 1.962 \, \text{N} \).

   - For the basketball:
     - Mass (\( m \)) = 1 kg.
     - Gravitational force (\( F \)) = \( 1 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 9.81 \, \text{N} \).

   Since the gravitational force acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass, the object with the greater mass will experience a stronger gravitational pull.

   In this case, the basketball, having a mass of 1 kg, will experience a stronger gravitational pull compared to the pebble, which has a mass of 0.2 kg.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Since the basketball has a greater mass, it experiences a stronger gravitational pull.

### Question:
Elliott notices that he is able to push a handcart at a speed of 19 m/s on cement and 23 m/s on carpet. Where will the handcart generate more heat?

### Options:
Option 1: On the carpet  
Option 2: On the cement

## Solution

To determine where the handcart will generate more heat, we need to consider the concept of friction. Friction is a force that opposes motion, and it is responsible for the generation of heat when two surfaces interact.

1. **Understanding Friction and Heat Generation:**
   - Frictional force is typically higher with rougher surfaces than with smoother ones.
   - The generation of heat is proportional to the frictional force. More friction implies more heat generation.

2. **Analyzing the Speeds:**
   - Elliott can push the handcart faster on the carpet (23 m/s) than on the cement (19 m/s). This implies that the surface of the carpet offers more resistance (friction) than that of the cement.
   - Despite the higher speed on the carpet, the effort required to achieve that speed indicates that the carpet has a higher frictional coefficient than the cement.

3. **Conclusion Based on Friction:**
   - A higher speed on carpet indicates that more work is needed to overcome friction, which in turn indicates higher heat generation.
   - Therefore, since the carpet has a higher friction and thus generates more heat, more heat will be produced on the carpet than on cement.

Thus, the handcart will generate more heat when moved on the carpet.

**Question:**
Mohsin's coin seems to be spinning at a speed of 2 cm/min on a ceramic plate and 1 cm/min on a paper plate. Does this mean his coin heats up more?

**Option 1:** Paper plate  
**Option 2:** Ceramic plate

## Solution

To determine where the coin heats up more, we should consider the factors that contribute to friction and heat generation. The spinning speed of the coin and the type of material (ceramic or paper) can influence the friction and heating.

1. **Understanding Friction and Heat Generation:**
   - Friction occurs when two surfaces are in contact and move relative to each other. The amount of heat generated due to friction depends on both the surface speed and the nature of the materials involved.
   - Faster movement typically generates more heat due to increased friction.

2. **Comparing Speeds:**
   - On the ceramic plate, the coin spins at a speed of 2 cm/min.
   - On the paper plate, the coin spins at a speed of 1 cm/min.
   - The higher speed on the ceramic plate suggests more frictional force is being exerted compared to the paper plate.

3. **Material Consideration:**
   - Ceramic is generally a smoother and harder surface compared to paper, possibly allowing the coin to spin faster with less initial friction. However, the consistent high speed on ceramic indicates that there is some friction still occurring because the coin is in continuous motion.
   - Paper, being a softer surface, might have more initial friction when the coin tries to move but allows less sustained spinning at a lower speed than ceramic.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the coin spins faster on the ceramic plate, indicating more kinetic activity and friction, it's likely to heat up more on the ceramic plate than on the paper plate.
   - The speed differential directly suggests more friction-induced heat generation on the ceramic plate.

Therefore, the coin heats up more on the **ceramic plate** because it spins faster, resulting in greater friction and heat generation.

Kate's boat propeller ran at 1300 revolutions per minute in the sea and 130 revolutions per minute in the river. What does this mean about where the propeller gets less hot?

**Options:**  
1. Option 1: Sea  
2. Option 2: River  

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - Propeller speed is given in revolutions per minute (rpm).
   - The heat generation in a mechanical system like a propeller is influenced by its operating speed; higher speed generally leads to increased friction, which can result in more heat due to kinetic energy being converted into thermal energy.
   
2. **Analyzing the Speeds:**
   - In the sea: The propeller operates at 1300 rpm.
   - In the river: The propeller operates at 130 rpm.

3. **Reasoning about Heat Generation:**
   - **Higher Speed and Heat:** The higher the revolutions per minute (rpm), the more work the propeller does within the same time frame. More work involves more friction and, consequently, more heat is generated.
   - With the propeller running at 1300 rpm in the sea, it is likely to produce significantly more heat due to increased friction compared to when it runs at 130 rpm in the river.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the propeller generates less heat when it operates at a lower speed, it will get less hot in the environment where it operates at 130 rpm compared to 1300 rpm.

Thus, the propeller is less hot in the river.

Option 1: Jim

Option 2: Jen

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Convert Units for Consistency:**
   - First, note the units in which Jim's and Jen's speeds are given: 
     - Jim's speed is 46 cm/second.
     - Jen's speed is 20 m/second.

   - Convert Jim's speed from centimeters per second to meters per second for an easy comparison.
     - Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, we can convert Jim's speed:
       \[
       46 \text{ cm/second} = \frac{46}{100} \text{ m/second} = 0.46 \text{ m/second}

**Question:**
While driving her car, Mary found out that the coefficient of friction in the forest is 0.8, whereas the coefficient on the road is 0.4. Where can she drive the car faster?

**Options:**
- Option 1: In the forest
- Option 2: On the road

## Detailed Solution and Explanation:

The problem asks where Mary can drive her car faster based on the coefficient of friction of two different surfaces: the forest and the road.

### Understanding Coefficient of Friction:

1. **Coefficient of Friction (\( \mu \))**: This is a dimensionless quantity that represents the frictional force between two surfaces. A higher coefficient indicates more friction.

2. **Frictional Force**: The frictional force can be calculated as:
   \[
   F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \cdot N
   \]
   where \( N \) is the normal force. On flat surfaces, \( N = mg \) where \( m \) is the mass of the car and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

### Influence on Speed:

- **High Friction (\( \mu = 0.8 \)) in the Forest**:
  - The high friction means that the tires of the car will grip better to the surface, reducing the risk of skidding but also limiting top speed because more engine power is required to overcome the higher friction.

- **Low Friction (\( \mu = 0.4 \)) on the Road**:
  - On the road, the lower friction implies that the tires have less grip. However, this means less resistance against motion, potentially allowing higher speed acceleration before reaching the limits of tire grip for cornering or braking.

### Conclusion:

- A road with less friction allows for potentially higher speeds in situations where traction is sufficient and safe (like straight-line acceleration). In contrast, a surface with higher friction (like the forest) is advantageous for control and reducing skidding risks on turns but doesn't inherently allow higher top speeds.

Therefore, on the road—where the coefficient of friction is lower and assuming straight-line driving without significant obstacles—Mary can potentially drive faster.

### Question:
A red mouse and a black mouse each run from high school towards the hospital. The red mouse runs at a speed of 4 meters per second, and the black mouse moves at a speed of 2 meters per second. Who took more time to reach the hospital?

### Options:
- Option 1: Red mouse
- Option 2: Black mouse

## Solution

To determine who took more time to reach the hospital, we need to compare the time taken by both the red mouse and the black mouse to cover the same distance at their respective speeds.

Let's denote:
- \( v_{red} = 4 \) meters/second (the speed of the red mouse)
- \( v_{black} = 2 \) meters/second (the speed of the black mouse)

The time taken to travel a certain distance is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Assuming both mice start and end their journey at the same points (from high school to hospital), the distance covered by both is the same. Therefore, the time taken by each mouse can be expressed as follows:

### Red Mouse
\[ t_{red} = \frac{d}{v_{red}} = \frac{d}{4} \]

### Black Mouse
\[ t_{black} = \frac{d}{v_{black}} = \frac{d}{2} \]

### Comparison

To compare who took more time, we compare \( t_{red} \) and \( t_{black} \).

- \( t_{red} = \frac{d}{4} \)
- \( t_{black} = \frac{d}{2} \)

Since \( \frac{d}{2} \) is greater than \( \frac{d}{4} \), the black mouse took more time to reach the hospital.

Thus, the black mouse, which moves slower, takes more time to cover the same distance compared to the red mouse.

**Question:**  
A race car and a pickup both traveled on the highway at the same speed. The race car driver parked after 45 minutes due to fatigue, while the pickup driver drove for 35 minutes. Which vehicle ultimately traveled a greater distance?

**Option 1:** Race car  
**Option 2:** Pickup

### Solution:

First, let's establish what we know from the problem:

- Both vehicles are traveling at the same speed.
- The race car traveled for 45 minutes.
- The pickup traveled for 35 minutes.

Since both vehicles travel at the same speed, the distance traveled by each vehicle is directly proportional to the time they spent traveling. The formula for distance is given by:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Let's assume the speed of both vehicles is \( v \) (in any consistent unit, e.g., km/min or mph).

1. **Calculate the distance covered by the race car:**

   The race car traveled for 45 minutes. Therefore, the distance it covered is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{race car}} = v \times 45
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered by the pickup:**

   The pickup traveled for 35 minutes. Therefore, the distance it covered is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{pickup}} = v \times 35
   \]

3. **Comparison of Distances:**

   To determine which vehicle traveled a greater distance, we compare \( \text{Distance}_{\text{race car}} \) and \( \text{Distance}_{\text{pickup}} \):
   \[
   v \times 45 \quad \text{(Race Car)}
   \]
   \[
   v \times 35 \quad \text{(Pickup)}
   \]

   Since \( 45 > 35 \), it is clear that:
   \[
   v \times 45 > v \times 35
   \]

Hence, the race car traveled a greater distance than the pickup.

### Conclusion:

The vehicle that traveled the greater distance is the race car.

**Translation of the Options:**

Option 1: Linda

Option 2: Melinda

**Solution:**

To determine which person did not go as fast as the other, we need to compare the time taken by both Linda and Melinda.

- Linda took 4 milliseconds to kayak across the lake.
- Melinda took 98 milliseconds to kayak across the same lake.

**Explanation:**

The speed of a person can be understood as the distance traveled divided by the time taken. In this case, since both are kayaking across the same lake (assuming the distance is the same), the speed is inversely proportional to the time taken. Thus, the less time it takes, the faster the person is.

1. Linda's time = 4 milliseconds
2. Melinda's time = 98 milliseconds 

Since 4 milliseconds is less than 98 milliseconds, it means Linda covered the distance in less time, indicating she was faster than Melinda.

Therefore, Melinda did not go as fast as Linda.

**Question:** A sedan weighs 40,000 pounds and a garbage truck weighs 5,789 pounds. When a traffic light turns green, both vehicles accelerate to a speed of 50 miles per hour. Which vehicle will easily win a race?

**Option 1:** Sedan  
**Option 2:** Garbage truck

## Solution:

When considering which vehicle would win a race starting from a stop, the key factor is acceleration, not just maximum speed, since both vehicles are reaching the same speed of 50 miles per hour.

According to the laws of physics, specifically Newton's second law, the force required to accelerate an object is directly proportional to its mass. This relationship is described by the equation:

\[ \text{Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration} \]

Given that both vehicles need to reach the same speed, the vehicle with the lesser mass will generally require less force to reach that speed in the same amount of time, assuming their engines are equally powerful in terms of force output. Acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass if the force remains constant. Therefore:

- **Sedan:** Mass = 40,000 pounds
- **Garbage Truck:** Mass = 5,789 pounds

The garbage truck weighs significantly less compared to the sedan. This suggests that all else being equal, it will be able to accelerate faster than the sedan due to requiring less force to achieve the same acceleration, owing to its lower mass.

Thus, in a scenario where both reach the same speed, assuming similar engine efficiencies and power outputs (which is a common simplification unless specified otherwise), a lighter vehicle typically accelerates faster.

Therefore, the garbage truck, being significantly lighter, will accelerate faster and is more likely to win a race to 50 miles per hour after the traffic light turns green.

**Question:** Two couples load their grocery goods onto each of their cars. Each car is pulled by a horse, and the horses are equally strong. The first horse has to carry 100 pounds of food, and the second horse has to carry 90 pounds of food. Which one will be slower?

**Option 1:** The first horse  
**Option 2:** The second horse

## Solution

In this problem, we are given two horses pulling loads of different weights. We need to determine which horse will go slower based on the weight they are carrying.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - Each horse is pulling a load.
   - The first horse is carrying a load of 100 pounds.
   - The second horse is carrying a load of 90 pounds.
   - Both horses have the same capability or strength.

2. **Analyzing the Situation:**
   - Since each horse has the same strength, the speed at which they can move depends on the load they are carrying.
   - A heavier load will naturally slow down the horse more compared to a lighter load, assuming that the two horses equally distribute their energy over the weight they carry.

3. **Comparing the Load:**
   - The first horse has a load of 100 pounds.
   - The second horse has a load of 90 pounds.
   - Simply comparing the two, the first horse carries more weight (100 pounds) than the second horse (90 pounds).

4. **Determination of Speed:**
   - The relative speed of a horse is inversely proportional to the load it carries, provided the strength or energy of the horse remains the same.
   - Therefore, the horse carrying the heavier load (100 pounds) will be slower compared to the horse carrying the lighter load (90 pounds).

### Question:
The weight of a bowling ball is 120 pounds and the weight of a baseball is 13 pounds. Which one has a weaker gravitational pull?

### Options:
- Option 1: Baseball
- Option 2: Bowling ball

## Solution:

Gravitational pull, often referred to as gravitational force, is proportional to the mass of an object. The more massive an object, the stronger its gravitational pull.

Let's look at the masses given:
- Mass of the bowling ball = 120 pounds
- Mass of the baseball = 13 pounds

The object with a lower mass will have a weaker gravitational pull. In this case, the baseball has a significantly lower mass (13 pounds) compared to the bowling ball (120 pounds).

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding Gravitational Pull**: Gravitational pull is influenced by the mass of an object. More mass equals a stronger gravitational pull when considering the force it would exert on another object due to gravity.

2. **Comparing the Mass of the Given Objects**: 
   - The bowling ball, at 120 pounds, is much heavier and thus exerts a stronger gravitational pull than the baseball.
   - The baseball, at 13 pounds, is lighter and thus has a weaker gravitational pull.

**Question:** Mahir weighs 600 Newtons while his friend Musa weighs 800 Newtons. Who is likely to have less mass?

**Option 1:** Mahir  
**Option 2:** Musa

## Solution

To determine who has less mass, we need to understand the relationship between weight and mass. The weight \(W\) of an object is given by the formula:

\[ W = m \cdot g \]

where:
- \( W \) is the weight in newtons,
- \( m \) is the mass in kilograms,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on Earth).

To find the mass \( m \), we rearrange the formula as:

\[ m = \frac{W}{g} \]

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the mass of Mahir:**

   For Mahir whose weight \( W = 600 \, \text{N} \):

   \[ m_{\text{Mahir}} = \frac{600 \, \text{N}}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} \approx 61.22 \, \text{kg} \]

2. **Calculate the mass of Musa:**

   For Musa whose weight \( W = 800 \, \text{N} \):

   \[ m_{\text{Musa}} = \frac{800 \, \text{N}}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} \approx 81.63 \, \text{kg} \]

3. **Comparison:**

   - Mahir's mass: \( 61.22 \, \text{kg} \)
   - Musa's mass: \( 81.63 \, \text{kg} \)

Mahir has less mass compared to Musa.

## Conclusion

Therefore, the person likely to have less mass is Mahir.

### Question:
If a skater rides at a speed of 23 m/s on a field and at 17 m/s in a skate park, then which surface is considered smoother?

### Options:
- Option 1: In the skate park
- Option 2: On the field

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding Smoother Surface:**  
   When considering which surface is smoother, we refer to the ease and speed at which the skater can move. A smoother surface typically allows for less friction, enabling faster movement. Therefore, if a skater rides more quickly on one surface compared to another, it's generally because the faster surface offers less resistance or friction, indicating it is smoother.

2. **Given Information:**  
   - The skater rides at 23 m/s on a field.
   - The skater rides at 17 m/s in a skate park.

3. **Analysis of Speeds:**  
   - Speed on the field = 23 m/s
   - Speed in the skate park = 17 m/s

   The skater's speed is higher on the field (23 m/s) compared to the skate park (17 m/s). Therefore, the skater moves faster on the field.

4. **Conclusion Based on Speed:**
   Since the skater can ride at a higher speed on the field than in the skate park, the field is the smoother surface because it offers less friction and resistance to movement, allowing for faster speeds.

5. **Correct Option Selection:**
   The field, where the speed is 23 m/s, is smoother than the skate park, where the speed is 17 m/s.

### Question:
Jimbo knows that the mass of his marble is 2 grams and the mass of the stone is 8 grams. What does this mean?

### Options:
- **Option 1:** The gravitational force on the marble is greater.
- **Option 2:** The gravitational force on the stone is greater.

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding Gravitational Force:**
    - The gravitational force exerted on an object is directly proportional to its mass. This is given by the formula:
      \[
      F = m \times g
      \]
      where \( F \) is the gravitational force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on the surface of the Earth).

2. **Mass Comparison:**
    - According to the problem, the mass of the marble is 2 grams and the mass of the stone is 8 grams.

3. **Calculation of Gravitational Force:**
    - For the marble:
      \[
      F_{\text{marble}} = 2 \, \text{g} \times g
      \]
    - For the stone:
      \[
      F_{\text{stone}} = 8 \, \text{g} \times g
      \]

4. **Comparison:**
    - Since both forces involve multiplication by the same \( g \) (acceleration due to gravity), the factor determining the size of the gravitational force is the mass itself.
    - As \( 8 \, \text{g} > 2 \, \text{g} \), it follows that:
      \[
      F_{\text{stone}} > F_{\text{marble}}
      \]

5. **Conclusion:**
    - The gravitational force on the stone is greater than the gravitational force on the marble due to its greater mass.

**English Translation:**
Jim owns both a truck and a car. The truck is 13,025 kg heavier than the car. When the gas pedal is pressed, which vehicle will accelerate faster?

**Options:**
- **Option 1:** ট্রাক (Truck)
- **Option 2:** গাড়ী (Car)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Acceleration:**
   Acceleration of a vehicle is generally influenced by its mass and the power applied to move it. Specifically, according to Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma), acceleration (a) is directly proportional to the force (F) applied and inversely proportional to the mass (m) of the object:
   
   \[
   a = \frac{F}{m}
   \]

2. **Mass Comparison:**
   - Given that the truck is 13,025 kg heavier than the car, it implies that the truck has a greater mass compared to the car. In terms of physics, this means that for the same amount of force applied (e.g., from the gas pedal), the vehicle with the lesser mass will experience greater acceleration.

3. **Logical Reasoning:**
   - Assuming both vehicles have engines with similar capability to exert force (which is a plausible assumption given we don't have specific power details), the car, being lighter, will accelerate more quickly when the gas pedal is pressed. This is because the same amount of force results in higher acceleration when applied to a smaller mass.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the principle of less mass leading to greater acceleration with equal force, the car, having less mass than the truck, will accelerate faster.

Tina and Mina are both traveling on the highway at the same speed. Tina drives for 12 minutes 56 seconds, and Mina drives for 36 minutes 48 seconds. Who will travel further?

**Option 1:** Tina  
**Option 2:** Mina

## Detailed Solution:

Since both Tina and Mina are driving at the same speed, the distance each travels is directly proportional to the time they spend driving.

To determine who travels further, we simply need to compare the times each of them spends driving.

1. **Convert the time both Tina and Mina drive into seconds to make comparisons easier.**

   - **Tina's driving time:**
     \[
     12 \, \text{minutes} \, 56 \, \text{seconds} = (12 \times 60) + 56 = 720 + 56 = 776 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

   - **Mina's driving time:**
     \[
     36 \, \text{minutes} \, 48 \, \text{seconds} = (36 \times 60) + 48 = 2160 + 48 = 2208 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

2. **Compare their driving times:**

   - Tina: 776 seconds
   - Mina: 2208 seconds

Since Mina drives for a longer amount of time (2208 seconds) compared to Tina (776 seconds), Mina travels further, as both are driving at the same speed.

**Conclusion:**

The person who drives for a longer duration will travel a greater distance. Therefore, Mina, who drove for 2208 seconds, will travel further than Tina.

**Question:** Lisa was playing with two model rockets. She launched the two rockets into the sky at the same time. After 30 seconds, the black rocket was 2 meters above the ground, and the red rocket was 23 centimeters above the ground. Which one had a higher speed?

**Option 1:** The red one  
**Option 2:** The black one

## Solution:

To determine which rocket had a higher speed, we need to calculate their respective speeds in terms of distance traveled over time.

Given:
- Time after launch for both rockets = 30 seconds
- Height of the black rocket = 2 meters = 200 centimeters
- Height of the red rocket = 23 centimeters

### Calculations:

1. **Speed of the black rocket:**  
   - Distance (black rocket) = 200 cm  
   - Time = 30 seconds  
   - Speed (black rocket) = Distance / Time = 200 cm / 30 s ≈ 6.67 cm/s

2. **Speed of the red rocket:**  
   - Distance (red rocket) = 23 cm  
   - Time = 30 seconds  
   - Speed (red rocket) = Distance / Time = 23 cm / 30 s ≈ 0.77 cm/s

### Comparison:

- Speed of the black rocket ≈ 6.67 cm/s
- Speed of the red rocket ≈ 0.77 cm/s

Since 6.67 cm/s > 0.77 cm/s, the black rocket has a higher speed than the red rocket.

**Conclusion:** The black rocket has a higher speed than the red rocket.

**Question:** The first mouse and the second mouse both start walking from the high school to the hospital. The first mouse travels at a speed of 110 cm/second, and the second mouse travels at a speed of 3 m/second. Which one takes more time to reach the hospital?

**Option 1:** The first mouse  
**Option 2:** The second mouse

## Solution

To determine which mouse takes more time to reach the hospital, we need to consider their speeds and compare the time it takes for each to cover the same distance.

### Conversion of Units

First, let's make sure both speeds are in the same unit for a fair comparison. We'll convert the speeds to meters per second.

- **First mouse:**
  \[
  110 \, \text{cm/second} = \frac{110}{100} \, \text{m/second} = 1.1 \, \text{m/second}
  \]

- **Second mouse:**
  \[
  3 \, \text{m/second} \quad (\text{already in meters per second})
  \]

### Time Comparison

Time taken to travel a certain distance is inversely proportional to speed, assuming the distance to the hospital is the same for both.

- Let \( D \) be the distance from the high school to the hospital.

  - **Time taken by the first mouse:** 
    \[
    t_1 = \frac{D}{1.1}
    \]

  - **Time taken by the second mouse:** 
    \[
    t_2 = \frac{D}{3}
    \]

### Comparing the Times

For a fixed distance \( D \), compare \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \):

- The first mouse has \( t_1 = \frac{D}{1.1} \).
  
- The second mouse has \( t_2 = \frac{D}{3} \).

Since 1.1 < 3, the speed of the first mouse (1.1 m/second) is less than the speed of the second mouse (3 m/second). Hence, \( \frac{D}{1.1} > \frac{D}{3} \), which means \( t_1 > t_2 \).

### Conclusion

The first mouse takes more time to reach the hospital than the second mouse because its speed is slower.

**Option 1:** Chicken  
**Option 2:** Turkey  

## Detailed Solution:

To determine who will reach the destination first, we look at the speeds of the chicken and the turkey.

- **Chicken's Speed:** 4 meters/second
- **Turkey's Speed:** 2 meters/second

From the information given:

1. **Speed** is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time.
2. Given the same starting point (from the barn to the shed) and assuming they travel the same distance, the one with the higher speed will reach the destination first.
3. The **Chicken** runs at 4 meters/second, which is faster than the **Turkey** running at 2 meters/second.

Since time to reach the destination is inversely proportional to speed (Time = Distance/Speed), the faster the runner, the lesser time they will need for the same distance.

Thus, the chicken, with a higher speed, will reach the shed first.

## Conclusion:

Since the chicken runs faster than the turkey, the chicken will reach the shed before the turkey.

**Question:**

Both the Ranger and the Rustler were riding horses that were galloping at the same speed. The Rustler started riding at 01:00, whereas the Ranger started riding at 03:00. Who traveled more distance?

**Option 1:** Ranger

**Option 2:** Rustler

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine who traveled more distance, we need to consider the duration each person was traveling, given that both horses were moving at the same speed.

1. **Starting Times**:
   - **Rustler** starts riding at 01:00.
   - **Ranger** starts riding at 03:00.

2. **Time Difference**:
   The Rustler starts 2 hours before the Ranger (from 01:00 to 03:00).

3. **Duration Calculation**:
   Since both were riding until the time of evaluation, and without additional information we assume they both stop at the same time after 03:00.
   - Suppose they stop at some common time after both start riding. Let's call this time \( T \).
   - **Rustler's riding duration** = \( T - 01:00 \).
   - **Ranger's riding duration** = \( T - 03:00 \).

4. **Comparison of Durations**:
   The Rustler has been riding since 01:00 but the Ranger only started at 03:00. Therefore, during the initial two hours (from 01:00 to 03:00), only the Rustler was traveling.

5. **Equal Speeds Assumption**:
   Given that both horses move at the same speed, the key difference in distance traveled will be due to the difference in time.

6. **Distance Traveled**:
   - Assuming the speed of both horses is \( v \), the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time spent traveling.
   - **Rustler's distance** = \( v \times (T - 01:00) \).
   - **Ranger's distance** = \( v \times (T - 03:00) \).

7. **Conclusion**:
   Since \( T - 01:00 \) (Rustler's travel time) is greater than \( T - 03:00 \) (Ranger's travel time) by exactly 2 hours, the Rustler travels more distance.

Therefore, the person who traveled more is the Rustler.

**Question:** A cheetah runs at a speed of 45 meters per hour and a dog runs at a speed of 2 kilometers per hour. So, how much time will the dog take?

**Option 1:** Less time

**Option 2:** More time

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Speeds:**

   - The speed of the cheetah is given as 45 meters per hour.
   - The speed of the dog is given as 2 kilometers per hour.

2. **Convert Dog's Speed to Meters per Hour:**

   - 1 kilometer = 1000 meters.
   - So, 2 kilometers per hour = 2 * 1000 meters per hour = 2000 meters per hour.

3. **Comparison of Speeds:**

   - The cheetah runs at 45 meters per hour.
   - The dog runs at 2000 meters per hour.

4. **Conclusion:**

   - Since 2000 meters per hour (dog) is greater than 45 meters per hour (cheetah), the dog is faster than the cheetah.
   - If both animals are to cover the same distance, the faster animal (dog) will take less time compared to the slower animal (cheetah).

5. **Final Analysis:**

   \- Given that the question concerns which one takes less or more time, and since the speed denotes that the dog runs faster, the dog will obviously take **less time** to cover any given distance compared to the cheetah.

Therefore, the correct option is:

**Question:** Mahir's weight is 480 kg*m*s^-2, whereas his friend Musa's weight is 650 N. Who is more likely to have less mass?

**Option 1:** Mahir  
**Option 2:** Musa

## Solution:

First, let's understand the units given and what they represent. In the International System of Units (SI), weight is measured in newtons (N), which is a unit of force. It is commonly calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Weight (N)} = \text{Mass (kg)} \times \text{Gravitational acceleration (m/s}^2) \]

For Earth, the standard gravitational acceleration (\(g\)) is approximately \(9.8 \text{ m/s}^2\).

### Step 1: Calculate Mass from Weight

1. **Mahir's Weight:**
   - Mahir's weight is given as \(480 \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}^2\). This unit is equivalent to newtons; thus, his weight in newtons is 480 N.

2. **Musa's Weight:**
   - Musa's weight is given straightforwardly as 650 N.

### Step 2: Determine Mass

Use the formula \(\text{Mass (kg)} = \frac{\text{Weight (N)}}{g}\).

**Question:** Mark has noticed that he can throw his lawn dart approximately 17 meters on soft soil and 12 meters on sand on average. This means that _____ is smoother?

**Option 1:** Soft soil  
**Option 2:** Sand  

## Solution:

To determine which surface is smoother, we analyze how far the lawn dart travels on each type of surface. The distance a dart travels can be influenced by the smoothness of the surface: generally, a smoother surface offers less friction and resistance, allowing the dart to travel a longer distance.

- **Soft soil:** Mark can throw the dart approximately 17 meters.
- **Sand:** Mark can throw the dart approximately 12 meters.

Since Mark can throw the dart further on soft soil (17 meters) compared to sand (12 meters), this implies that the soft soil offers less resistance than sand. In other words, the soil surface is smoother compared to the sandy surface for the dart to travel a further distance.

Therefore, the surface where the dart travels further (soft soil) would be considered smoother.

**Question:**  
The mammoth traveled through the water hole at a speed of 21 km/h, but traveled at a speed of 14 km/h on solid ground because solid ground was?

**Option 1:** Less resistant  
**Option 2:** More resistant  

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to reason about the concept of resistance and its effect on the speed of travel.

1. **Understanding Speed in Different Mediums:**
   - The mammoth travels at 21 km/h through a water hole.
   - The mammoth travels at 14 km/h on solid ground.
   
2. **Resistance and Speed Relationship:**
   - Typically, an object or being experiences more resistance in a medium where it moves slower, assuming the energy input remains constant.
   - This means that if the mammoth's speed is lower on the solid ground, it likely faces more resistance there compared to when it is in the water hole.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Since the speed is higher in the water hole (21 km/h), it suggests less resistance in that medium compared to solid ground.
   - Contrastingly, the speed is reduced on solid ground (14 km/h), indicating that solid ground offers more resistance.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The reason the mammoth travels slower on solid ground is due to it being more resistant compared to when it travels through the water hole.

Thus, the correct option is that solid ground was ""more resistant.""

### Question:
Ian and Avery are catching trains from the same station. Ian's train is red and is traveling to a destination 40 miles away at 10 miles per hour. Avery's train is green and is traveling to a destination 40 miles away at 30 miles per hour. Which train is slower?

### Options:
- Option 1: Red
- Option 2: Green

## Step-by-Step Solution

To determine which train is slower, we need to calculate the time each train takes to reach its destination.

1. **Calculate the time for Ian's train (Red):**
   - Distance = 40 miles
   - Speed = 10 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 40 miles / 10 miles per hour = 4 hours

2. **Calculate the time for Avery's train (Green):**
   - Distance = 40 miles
   - Speed = 30 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 40 miles / 30 miles per hour = 4/3 hours (approximately 1.33 hours)

3. **Comparison:**
   - Ian's train takes 4 hours.
   - Avery's train takes approximately 1.33 hours.

The train that takes more time to reach its destination is the slower train. Ian's train takes 4 hours, which is longer than Avery's 1.33 hours.

Therefore, the slower train is Ian's train, which is the red train.

**Question:**
A sedan weighs 2500 kg and a garbage truck weighs 1000 kg. When the traffic light turns green, both vehicles accelerate to reach a speed of 50 miles per hour. Which vehicle will win the race?

**Option 1:** Sedan  
**Option 2:** Garbage truck

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two vehicles: a sedan and a garbage truck.
   - The weights are 2500 kg for the sedan and 1000 kg for the garbage truck.
   - Both vehicles accelerate to the same speed of 50 miles per hour from a stop.

2. **Key Concept: Acceleration and Time:**
   - The underlying concept here is how quickly each vehicle can reach the speed of 50 miles per hour, assuming they start from rest when the light turns green.
   - Typically, the vehicle that can accelerate faster to the specified speed will reach it first and would ""win"" the initial short race to that speed.

3. **Weight and Acceleration:**
   - Acceleration \( a \) of an object is determined by the net force acting on it and its mass \( m \), according to Newton’s second law of motion \( F = ma \).
   - The force exerted by each vehicle depends on its engine power, not given in this problem.
   - However, if we assume similar engine efficiency (which may not be realistic but without additional data, it's a reasonable assumption for comparison), the lighter vehicle generally accelerates faster.

4. **Vehicle Comparison:**
   - Given that the garbage truck is lighter at 1000 kg compared to the sedan at 2500 kg, and assuming equal engine efficiency, the truck can accelerate to 50 miles per hour faster than the sedan.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - With the lighter weight providing a potentially quicker acceleration assuming equal power, the garbage truck is likely to reach the speed of 50 miles per hour faster and thereby ""win"" the initial race to the specified speed.

Therefore, the garbage truck would win the race to reach the speed of 50 miles per hour first.

### Question:
A rolling marble creates a resistance force of 5 Newtons on dirt, while it creates a resistance force of 73 Newtons on sand. Where can the marble travel further?

### Options:
- Option 1: Sand
- Option 2: Dirt

## Solution

To determine where the marble can travel further, we need to understand the effect of resistance on the movement of the marble.

1. **Resistance Explanation:**
   - Resistance force is a force that opposes the motion of an object. The greater the resistance force, the harder it is for an object to move.
   - In this scenario, the resistance force on dirt is 5 Newtons, and on sand, it is 73 Newtons.

2. **Comparison of Resistance Forces:**
   - On dirt, the resistance is relatively low at 5 Newtons.
   - On sand, the resistance is significantly higher at 73 Newtons.

3. **Implication of Resistance on Movement:**
   - A higher resistance force means the surface is more resistant to movement, which results in the marble traveling a shorter distance.
   - Conversely, a lower resistance force means the surface offers less opposition, allowing the marble to travel further.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the sand has a higher resistance force of 73 Newtons compared to dirt's 5 Newtons, the marble encounters less resistance on dirt.
   - Consequently, the marble can travel further on dirt than on sand.

Therefore, the marble can travel further on dirt.

Diana and Dave board the train at the same station. If Diana gets off the train after 10 minutes, and Dave travels for 15 minutes and then gets off, who traveled a shorter distance?

**Options:**
1. Diana
2. Dave

## Solution:

To determine who traveled a shorter distance, we need to consider the duration each person was on the train, assuming the train travels at a constant speed throughout the journey.

1. **Diana's Journey:**
   - Duration: 10 minutes

2. **Dave's Journey:**
   - Duration: 15 minutes

Since both individuals are on the same train, which travels at a constant speed, the distance covered is directly proportional to the time spent traveling. Given this:

- Distance traveled by Diana = Train's speed * 10 minutes
- Distance traveled by Dave = Train's speed * 15 minutes

Comparing the two distances:

- Because 15 minutes > 10 minutes, it follows that:
  - Distance covered by Dave > Distance covered by Diana

Therefore, Diana traveled a shorter distance than Dave.

## Conclusion:
Diana traveled a shorter distance than Dave.

### Question:
The fastest land animal on Earth, the cheetah, was racing against a rabbit for 100 meters. Who will win this race?

### Options:
- Option 1: Cheetah
- Option 2: Rabbit

## Step-by-Step Solution

The question poses a race scenario between two animals—a cheetah and a rabbit—over a 100-meter distance.

**Step 1: Understanding Cheetah's Speed**
- The cheetah is renowned for being the fastest land animal. It can accelerate quickly and maintain a top speed of around 80 to 98 kilometers per hour (approximately 50 to 61 miles per hour) over short distances.

**Step 2: Understanding Rabbit's Speed**
- Rabbits are known for their agility and quick starts, but their top speed is significantly less compared to a cheetah. Typically, a rabbit can run at speeds of about 40-45 kilometers per hour (approximately 25-28 miles per hour).

**Step 3: Comparing the Speeds**
- The cheetah's speed is nearly double that of the rabbit, meaning it can cover the same distance in a much shorter time.

**Step 4: Determining the Winner**
- Since the cheetah achieves a much greater speed than the rabbit, especially over short sprint distances such as 100 meters, it is logical to conclude that the cheetah will win the race.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis of their speeds over short distances, the cheetah, being the fastest land animal, will outrun the rabbit in a 100-meter race.

**Question:**
Ted was riding his bike in the park. When he was on the cement path, he could zip around the park in 28 minutes, and he took 17 minutes on the grass. Where will the bike become hotter?

**Options:**
1. Cement path
2. Grass

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Scenario:**
   - Ted can complete the path around the park in 28 minutes on cement.
   - He takes less time, 17 minutes, on the grass.

2. **Analyzing Speed and Effort:**
   - Since Ted takes less time to cover the same distance on grass (17 minutes) compared to cement (28 minutes), this implies that he is riding faster on the grass.
   - Faster speeds generally lead to more energy expenditure, meaning the bike's components, especially those that generate friction (like tires and brakes), would likely heat up more.
   
3. **Concept of Friction and Heat Generation:**
   - On a cement path, the surface tends to be smoother, which generally results in less friction compared to a grass path.
   - However, the key consideration here is the speed. Despite potentially higher friction on the grass at higher speeds, frictional heating is mainly influenced by how much work (force over distance) is done.
   - As Ted travels faster on the grass, the kinetic energy (and hence the energy converted to heat due to friction) would increase compared to riding slower on the cement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Taking into account that higher speeds generally result in more heat generated due to increased work being done against friction, the bike is more likely to heat up on the grass where the speed is greater and more energy is being exerted.

### Question:
If both a car and a pickup travel at a speed of 60 miles per hour, but the car stops 1.3 hours later whereas the pickup stops 186 minutes later, which one has traveled a shorter distance?

### Options:
1. Car
2. Pickup

## Step-by-Step Solution:

### Step 1: Convert all times to the same unit
- The car travels for 1.3 hours.
- The pickup travels for 186 minutes.

Let's convert the time the pickup travels from minutes to hours because the speed is given in miles per hour.

186 minutes = \(\frac{186}{60}\) hours = 3.1 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the distance for each vehicle
The formula to calculate distance is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

- **Car's Distance:**
  - Speed = 60 miles per hour
  - Time = 1.3 hours
  - Distance = \(60 \times 1.3 = 78\) miles

- **Pickup's Distance:**
  - Speed = 60 miles per hour
  - Time = 3.1 hours
  - Distance = \(60 \times 3.1 = 186\) miles

### Step 3: Compare the distances
- Car's distance = 78 miles
- Pickup's distance = 186 miles

Since 78 miles < 186 miles, the car travels a shorter distance than the pickup.

Therefore, the car has traveled the shorter distance.

**Question:**
A volleyball player jumped 40 meters on the gym floor, but only 22 meters on the sand at the sea shore. What is the reason for this?

**Options:**
- Option 1: More resistance
- Option 2: Less resistance

## Solution:

To understand why the volleyball player jumps different distances on different surfaces, let’s analyze the elements involved:

1. **Surface Type and Resistance:**
   - The gym floor is typically a solid, hard surface. This means it provides a firm and stable platform for pushing off, leading to minimal energy dissipation. The resistance exerted by such a surface is relatively low when jumping, allowing the player to utilize all their energy in the jump effectively.
   
   - Sand, on the other hand, is a loose surface with particles that move around when force is applied. Sand absorbs more energy when you exert a force on it. This increased energy absorption is due to the higher resistance sand provides. As a result, part of the energy that the player applies for jumping is lost in compressing and shifting the sand particles, rather than being fully converted into vertical jump height or horizontal distance.

2. **Comparison of Jump Distances:**
   - The player jumped 40 meters on the gym floor, which indicates efficient use of energy with low resistance.
   - On the sand, the jump distance reduced to 22 meters because the increased resistance led to more energy being absorbed by the surface, leaving less energy available to propel the player.

From this analysis, it is clear that the reduced jump distance on sand is due to the **increased resistance** of the surface.

## Conclusion:

Based on the reasoning above, the correct option is:

The cup was faster on the concrete floor because the concrete floor had?

### Options:
1. More friction
2. Less friction

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding Friction and Motion:** 
   - Friction is the force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact. If the surface has more friction, it tends to slow down the motion more compared to a surface with less friction.

2. **Observation on Concrete Floor:**
   - On the concrete floor, the cup rolls for a distance of 25 centimeters (0.25 meters) in 3 seconds. The distance covered is relatively significant over a short time, indicating that the cup retained more of its rolling speed on the concrete.

3. **Observation on Carpeted Floor:**
   - On the carpeted floor, the cup only rolls for 0.18 meters in the same time span of 3 seconds. The shorter distance covered suggests that the cup slowed down faster on the carpet, indicating higher resistance (friction).

4. **Comparing the Two Surfaces:**
   - The key factor affecting the distance covered by the cup in both scenarios is friction. Concrete allows the cup to roll further because it offers less resistance to motion compared to the carpeted floor.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The cup was faster on the concrete floor, rolling a greater distance, due to **less friction**. Less friction on the concrete allows the cup to maintain a higher speed over the same period compared to the carpet.

Since the cup rolls further on the concrete floor, demonstrating that friction is less, the correct option based on the reasoning provided is:

### Question:
Todd gets in his car on Monday and drives for 4 hours. He does the same thing on Tuesday but stops 3 hours earlier. Which day does he travel a shorter distance?

### Options:
- Option 1: Monday
- Option 2: Tuesday

## Solution

To solve this problem, let's analyze the driving times for each day and determine the distance traveled.

### Monday:
- Todd drives for 4 hours.

### Tuesday:
- Todd would normally drive for 4 hours, but he stops 3 hours earlier than Monday. 
- Therefore, Todd drives for \(4 - 3 = 1\) hour on Tuesday.

Next, let's consider the distance. Assuming the speed is constant on both days:
- Distance traveled is calculated as \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).

We don't have specific information about the speed, but it is not needed because the problem is comparing distances based solely on time driven.

### Comparing Distances:
- **Monday's distance** = Speed × 4 hours
- **Tuesday's distance** = Speed × 1 hour

Since Todd drives for a longer time on Monday compared to Tuesday (4 hours vs. 1 hour, respectively), the distance driven on Monday is greater.

### Conclusion:
Todd travels a shorter distance on Tuesday because he only drives for 1 hour compared to 4 hours on Monday.

   - **Option 1:** Slow-moving
   - **Option 2:** Fast-moving

2. **Detailed Solution:**

   To determine whether the F-16 is ""slow-moving"" or ""fast-moving,"" we need to consider its purpose and design compared to a jumbo jet. Here are the relevant points:

   - The F-16 is a fighter jet designed for speed, agility, and combat scenarios. Its relatively lighter weight compared to a jumbo jet suggests it is built for rapid acceleration, high speed, and maneuverability. The design and purpose of the F-16 indicate that it is engineered to be fast-moving.
   - On the other hand, a jumbo jet, weighing significantly more at 439987 kg, is designed for transporting numerous passengers and cargo efficiently over longer distances. It prioritizes stability, fuel efficiency, and capacity rather than speed, especially when compared to a fighter jet like the F-16.

   By comparing the roles and characteristics of these two types of aircraft, it is clear that:

   - The F-16, due to its design as a light, agile fighter aircraft, is fast-moving when compared to the much heavier jumbo jet, which is not built for high-speed travel in the same sense as a fighter jet.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Based on the above reasoning, the correct choice is that the F-16 was ""fast-moving.""

**Question:** The diameter of a strand of hair is 0.04 mm, whereas the diameter of a rope is 9 mm. Therefore, hair is?
- **Option 1:** Stronger
- **Option 2:** Weaker

## Solution:
To determine whether hair is stronger or weaker than a rope, we need to consider their diameters and the general characteristics of these materials.

1. **Comparing Diameters:**

   - **Strand of Hair Diameter:** 0.04 mm
   - **Rope Diameter:** 9 mm

   From these numbers, it is evident that the diameter of a rope is significantly larger than that of a strand of hair. 

2. **Understanding Strength:**

   - The strength of a material generally correlates with its thickness when made of the same or similar materials. A larger diameter often implies a more robust structure due to greater cross-sectional area. 
   - In practical terms, ropes are engineered to handle significant tension and force due to their thicker diameter and material properties, whereas hair, being much thinner, is more fragile and breaks under smaller amounts of force.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Given that the rope has a much larger diameter and is specifically designed for strength, it is logical to conclude that a rope is stronger. Thus, a strand of hair, with its much smaller diameter, is weaker in comparison.

Therefore, the correct answer to whether hair is stronger or weaker than a rope is that hair is weaker.

**Question:** Jason has observed that his ATV moves at a speed of 29.2044 miles/hour on ice and at a speed of 34 km/hour on sand. Sand compared to ice is _____?

**Option 1:** More resistant  
**Option 2:** Less resistant  

## Solution:

### Step 1: Convert units for comparison
To compare the resistance of sand and ice better, we need to use the same units for speed. The speeds are given in miles/hour and km/hour, so let’s convert the speed on sand from km/hour to miles/hour.

1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers

Thus, converting 34 km/hour to miles/hour:
\[
34 \text{ km/hour} \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{1.60934 \text{ km}} \approx 21.1264 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Now, we have:
- Speed on ice: 29.2044 miles/hour
- Speed on sand: 21.1264 miles/hour

### Step 2: Analyze the resistance
Now, let's analyze the resistance:
- The ATV travels faster on ice (29.2044 miles/hour) than on sand (21.1264 miles/hour).

Based on the ATV's performance, a higher speed implies less resistance. This means the vehicle encounters less resistance on ice, as it can travel faster compared to sand.

### Conclusion:
Since the ATV moves slower on sand than on ice, sand is more resistant than ice.

**Question:** Today during tiffin, I took a cake. My two friends, Ayush and Sabana, ate 1/3 and 2/5 of the cake respectively. I ate the remaining part of the cake. Who ate more cake?

**Option:** 
1. Sabana
2. Ayush

## Solution:

1. **Determine the portions eaten by each person:**
   - Ayush ate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cake.
   - Sabana ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cake.

2. **Compare the fractions to determine who ate more:**

   To compare \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} \), we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Let's convert these fractions:

   - Convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:   
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{5}{15}
     \]

   - Convert \( \frac{2}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:   
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{6}{15}
     \]

3. **Compare the converted fractions \( \frac{5}{15} \) and \( \frac{6}{15} \):**

   \( \frac{5}{15} < \frac{6}{15} \).

   Therefore, Sabana ate a larger portion of the cake than Ayush.

**Question:**
Tommy took his big brother to the pool. Tommy can dive at a speed of 17 m/s and his brother can dive at a speed of 39 m/s. Who will finish the dive first?

**Options:**
- Option 1: Tommy
- Option 2: His brother

## Solution:

To determine who finishes the dive first, we need to compare Tommy's speed and his brother's speed. The dive time is directly related to the speed: the faster the speed, the shorter the time it takes to complete the dive.

1. **Tommy's speed:** 17 m/s
2. **Brother's speed:** 39 m/s

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- Both Tommy and his brother are diving, but no specific distance for the dive is given. For the purpose of comparison, we assume they both dive the same distance \(d\).

- The time taken to complete a dive is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
  \]

- **Tommy's dive time**:
  \[
  T_{\text{Tommy}} = \frac{d}{17}
  \]

- **Brother's dive time**:
  \[
  T_{\text{Brother}} = \frac{d}{39}
  \]

- Since 39 m/s (brother's speed) is significantly faster than 17 m/s (Tommy's speed), it implies that \(T_{\text{Brother}} < T_{\text{Tommy}}\).

Hence, Tommy's brother, diving at 39 m/s, will complete the dive in a shorter time than Tommy.

Therefore, Tommy's brother will finish the dive first.

**Concluding Answer:**
Since his brother dives faster, the correct option is **Option 2**.

### Question:
Sheri rolls her ball down two lanes. The ball covers the red lane in 15 seconds, but it covers the green lane in 20 seconds. Both lanes are of the same length. Does the ball slow down in the green lane because of?

### Options:
1. More friction
2. Less friction

## Solution

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between friction and the time taken to cover the same distance.

1. **Understanding Friction and Speed:**
   - Friction is a resistive force that opposes the motion of objects. 
   - Greater friction implies more resistance, which typically results in reduced speed if the same force is applied.
   - Conversely, less friction means the object can move more freely without much resistance.

2. **Analyzing the Problem:**
   - The problem states that the ball takes 15 seconds to cover the red lane and 20 seconds to cover the green lane.
   - Since both lanes are of the same length, the difference in time indicates a difference in speed.

3. **Comparing the Lanes:**
   - In the red lane, the ball takes less time (15 seconds), indicating it moves faster.
   - In the green lane, the ball takes more time (20 seconds), indicating it moves slower.

4. **Reasoning the Cause of Slowness:**
   - The ball moves slower in the green lane even though both lanes are of the same length.
   - This suggests that the ball experiences more resistance in the green lane.
   - More resistance in this context would be attributed to more friction because the ball is slowing down.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct inference is that the ball slows down in the green lane due to greater friction.

Therefore, the ball slows down in the green lane because of **more friction**.

**Question:** A cat travels at a speed of 3 meters/second through a river and at a speed of 22 miles/hour through a jungle. This means the cat faces less obstruction where?

**Option 1:** River
**Option 2:** Jungle

### Solution

To determine where the cat faces less obstruction, we need to compare the speeds at which the cat travels through the river and the jungle. The higher the speed, the less obstruction there is.

1. **Convert Speed to Consistent Units:**

   - **Speed in the River:** 3 meters/second

   - **Speed in the Jungle:** 22 miles/hour

   To compare these speeds, we should convert them into the same units. Let's convert the 22 miles/hour to meters/second because meters/second is a more universally used unit in physics.

   - **Conversion factor:** 1 mile = 1609.34 meters

   \[
   22 \text{ miles/hour} = 22 \times 1609.34 \text{ meters/hour} = 35405.48 \text{ meters/hour}
   \]

   Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we convert meters/hour to meters/second:

   \[
   35405.48 \text{ meters/hour} \div 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} \approx 9.84 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

2. **Compare the Speeds:**

   - **Speed in the River:** 3 meters/second
   - **Speed in the Jungle:** 9.84 meters/second

   The speed of the cat in the jungle is approximately 9.84 meters/second, which is greater than the speed of 3 meters/second in the river. 

3. **Conclusion:**

   Since the cat moves faster in the jungle, it faces less obstruction in the jungle compared to the river.

**Option 1**: Tina  
**Option 2**: Mina

### Step-by-step Solution

1. **Understanding the problem**: Since both Tina and Mina are driving at the same speed, the distance each one travels is directly proportional to the time they spend driving. Thus, the person who drives for a longer duration will cover a greater distance.

2. **Convert time into seconds for easy comparison**:
    - **Tina's driving time**:
      - Minutes = 37 minutes 50 seconds
      - Convert to seconds: \(37 \times 60 + 50 = 2220 + 50 = 2270\) seconds

    - **Mina's driving time**:
      - Minutes = 36 minutes 48 seconds
      - Convert to seconds: \(36 \times 60 + 48 = 2160 + 48 = 2208\) seconds

3. **Compare the times**:  
   - Tina has driven for 2270 seconds.
   - Mina has driven for 2208 seconds.

4. **Determine who has driven the greater distance**:  
   - Since both are traveling at the same speed, the longer duration corresponds to a greater distance.
   - 2270 seconds (Tina) is greater than 2208 seconds (Mina).

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, Tina has driven a greater distance than Mina.

### Options in English:
- Option 1: Ranger
- Option 2: Rustler

## Solution

To solve this problem, we must evaluate the amount of time each individual has been traveling, given that they are both riding horses at the same speed.

1. **Understand the Departure Times:**
   - The ranger departs at 1:00.
   - The rustler departs at 2:00.

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - Both are riding at the same speed. 
   - The critical factor here is the time each one has spent traveling because their speeds are identical.

3. **Calculate the Time Each Person Has Traveled:**
   - Let's assume we are considering the time until a fixed end point. 
   - Suppose we evaluate the situation at some later time, such as 3:00.
   
4. **Time Calculation:**
   - By 3:00, the ranger has been traveling for 2 hours (from 1:00 to 3:00).
   - By 3:00, the rustler has been traveling for 1 hour (from 2:00 to 3:00).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since both are traveling at the same speed, the distance traveled by each is directly proportional to the time they have been traveling.
   - Therefore, the ranger, who has been traveling longer, will have traveled more distance than the rustler.

Thus, the correct answer is that the ranger has traveled more.

### Question:
Mary's skateboard moves at a speed of 11 m/s when she is skating in a wet skatepark, and it moves at 29 m/s when she is skating in a dry skatepark. Does this mean her skateboard heats up when she rides it?

### Options:
- **Option 1**: Wet skatepark
- **Option 2**: Dry skatepark

## Step 2: Analyze the Situation

To determine when the skateboard heats up, we must understand the relationship between speed and friction. Friction generates heat, and friction is typically higher on a dry surface compared to a wet one.

### Explanation:
1. **Wet Skatepark:**
   - Speed: 11 m/s
   - Friction: Lower, because the surface is wet and slippery.
   - Heat Production: Lower friction means less heat is generated by the skateboard's wheels.

2. **Dry Skatepark:**
   - Speed: 29 m/s
   - Friction: Higher, because the surface provides more resistance.
   - Heat Production: Higher friction results in more heat generation due to increased resistance between the skateboard wheels and the dry surface.

#### Conclusion:

Therefore, the skateboard is more likely to heat up in the dry skatepark due to higher friction causing more heat through increased resistance.

## Final Decision:
The increase in speed and the consequent heating happen more in the dry skatepark.

**Question:**
Mary's skateboard moves at a speed of 3,985 cm/second when she skates in a wet skate park, and it moves at 829 cm/second when she skates in a dry skate park. Does this mean her skateboard gets hotter when she rides it?

- **Option 1:** Wet skate park
- **Option 2:** Dry skate park

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Mary skates on two different surfaces: a wet skate park and a dry skate park.
   - Her skateboard's speed is higher on the wet surface (3,985 cm/second) compared to the dry surface (829 cm/second).

2. **Relation Between Speed and Temperature:**
   - It's a known principle in physics that friction generates heat. The more friction there is, the more heat is generated.
   - Speed itself is not directly related to temperature. However, the context indicates that the inquiry concerns heat generated due to friction.

3. **Friction on Different Surfaces:**
   - **Wet Surface:** Generally, a wet surface has less friction than a dry surface. This is because water acts as a lubricant, reducing the contact resistance.
     - As a result, the skateboard moves faster (3,985 cm/second).
   - **Dry Surface:** A dry surface typically has more friction than a wet surface.
     - Therefore, the skateboard moves slower (829 cm/second) due to increased friction, which would generate more heat.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - On a dry surface, due to higher friction, more heat is generated compared to a wet surface.
   - Hence, it's likely that her skateboard gets hotter when she is skating on a dry skate park rather than a wet one.

   - Question: Jim wears armor that is 1 inch thick. Jack is wearing only a shirt that is 3 centimeters thick. Which one will stop a bullet?

   - Option 1: Armor
   - Option 2: Shirt

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To determine which item is more likely to stop a bullet, we need to compare the materials of the armor and the shirt in terms of their ability to resist penetration.

   - **Armor (Jim's Equipment):**
     - The armor mentioned is 1 inch thick. Armor is typically made of materials that are designed to stop or slow down bullets, such as steel, Kevlar, or other composite materials.
     - 1 inch is equivalent to 2.54 centimeters.

   - **Shirt (Jack's Equipment):**
     - The shirt is described as 3 centimeters thick. This is presumably a cotton shirt, since it is specified as a ""সুতির শার্ট"" (cotton shirt in Bengali).
     - Even though the shirt is slightly thicker in terms of centimeters (3 cm vs. 2.54 cm), it is made of cotton, which is not designed to stop bullets.

   **Material Consideration:**
   - Armor materials (like steel or Kevlar) have inherent qualities that absorb and disperse the energy from bullets, preventing penetration.
   - Cotton, regardless of thickness, does not have the necessary properties to stop a bullet effectively.

   **Conclusion:**
   - Although Jack's shirt is thicker when measured in centimeters, the material's nature (cotton) is not suitable for stopping bullets.
   - Jim's armor, despite being slightly less thick in direct measurement, is specifically designed to stop bullets due to its material properties.

Thus, the armor, due to its purpose and material, will more effectively stop a bullet compared to a cotton shirt.

**Option 2:** Brother

## Solution:

To determine who finishes the dive first, we need to compare Tommy's and his brother's diving speeds in the same unit.

1. **Convert Tommy's speed to meters per second:**
   - Tommy's speed is given as 330 cm/second.
   - Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, Tommy's speed in meters per second is:
     \[
     \frac{330 \text{ cm}}{100} = 3.3 \text{ m/second}
     \]

2. **Brother's speed:**
   - The brother's speed is given as 2 m/second.

3. **Comparison of speeds:**
   - Tommy's speed = 3.3 m/second
   - Brother's speed = 2 m/second

Since Tommy's speed (3.3 m/second) is greater than his brother's speed (2 m/second), Tommy will complete the dive faster than his brother.

**Question:** Jim lives 10 miles from the riot server. Jarina lives 2000 miles away from the riot server. Both have the same internet speed. Whose ping will be higher?

**Option 1:** Jim  
**Option 2:** Jarina

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

**Understanding Ping:**  
Ping is a network utility used to test the reachability of a host on a network and measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer and back. The ping value is generally measured in milliseconds (ms).

**Factors Affecting Ping:**  
1. **Distance:** The further the distance, generally the higher the ping because the data packets need more time to travel to the destination.
2. **Internet Speed:** The speed and quality of the internet connection can also affect ping, but as stated in the problem, both Jim and Jarina have the same internet speed. Thus, we focus on the distance only.

**Comparison:**  
- **Jim** is 10 miles away from the server.
- **Jarina** is 2000 miles away from the server.

Both have the same internet speed, so the only differentiating factor is the distance from the server. Since Jarina is significantly farther from the server compared to Jim, the data packets in Jarina's case have to travel a much greater distance. This increased travel distance directly translates to a higher ping.

Therefore, because of the increased distance, Jarina's ping will be higher than Jim's.

## Conclusion:
The person with the higher ping is determined by the distance from the server, and since Jarina lives 2000 miles away, compared to Jim's 10 miles, Jarina will have a higher ping.

Option 1: Bus  
Option 2: Car

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Speed:**
   - Speed is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the time taken to travel that distance.
   - Formula: \(\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}\)

2. **Assumptions:**
   - Let the distance to the workplace be \(D\).
   - The time taken by car is 2 hours.
   - The time taken by bus is 4 hours.

3. **Calculating the Car's Speed:**

4. **Calculating the Bus's Speed:**
   - Using the formula for speed: \(\text{Speed of Bus} = \frac{D}{4}\).

5. **Comparing Speeds:**
   - To determine which vehicle travels at a higher speed, we compare \(\frac{D}{2}\) with \(\frac{D}{4}\).
   - Given that \(D\) is the same in both cases, we only compare the denominators.
   - \(\frac{D}{2}\) (speed of car) is greater than \(\frac{D}{4}\) (speed of bus).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The car travels a greater distance in the same period compared to the bus, considering the same distance \(D\).

Thus, the vehicle that travels at a higher speed is the car.

The speed of the first turtle is 40 cm/second and the speed of the second turtle is 4 m/second. Which animal will take more time to reach the sea if both continue to walk on the beach?

**Option Translations:**
- **Option 1:** First turtle
- **Option 2:** Second turtle

## Solution

- **Step 1: Understanding the Speeds**

  First, convert the speeds to the same unit for easier comparison. Since one is in centimeters and the other is in meters, let's convert both speeds to centimeters per second (cm/s).

  - Speed of the first turtle = 40 cm/second (no change needed)
  - Speed of the second turtle = 4 m/second = 400 cm/second (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters)

- **Step 2: Comparing the Speeds**

  Now that both speeds are in the same unit (cm/second), we can compare them directly:
  
  - First turtle's speed = 40 cm/second
  - Second turtle's speed = 400 cm/second

- **Step 3: Determining Time Taken**

  The time taken to reach a destination is inversely proportional to speed when the distance is constant:

  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
  \]

  As the speed of the second turtle (400 cm/s) is greater than the speed of the first turtle (40 cm/s), the second turtle will take less time to reach the same distance.

- **Conclusion**

### Question:
A robot cleans tiles in 7 minutes and plush carpet in 100 seconds because it has?

### Options:
- Option 1: More friction
- Option 2: Less friction

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding Friction and Cleaning**:
   - Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object. Surfaces with more friction typically make movement harder and slower, hence taking more time to clean.

2. **Time Conversion for Consistency**:
   - Convert both times into the same unit for a proper comparison.
   - 7 minutes = 7 × 60 = 420 seconds
  
3. **Analysis**:
   - The robot takes 420 seconds to clean the tiles and only 100 seconds to clean the plush carpet.
   - Tiles are usually smoother surfaces and generally provide less friction compared to plush carpets.
   - On a surface with less friction, the robot can work more efficiently, explaining the seemingly paradoxical situation where the plush carpet takes less time.
   
4. **Reason for Different Cleaning Times**:
   - The robot might take longer on tiles due to less friction – the cleaning mechanism takes more time to effectively address cleaning.
   - Conversely, the plush carpet, having more friction, may allow the cleaning mechanism to work more effectively in a shorter duration, assuming more friction allows better grip or interaction with the cleaning tools.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the robot cleans tiles in more time, which typically have less friction compared to the plush carpet, it suggests that the quicker cleaning of the plush carpet is due to it having more friction. Thus, it takes less time where there is more friction.

**Question:**
The weight of a sedan is 1500 kg and the weight of a garbage truck is 69632 pounds. When the traffic light turns green, both vehicles accelerate to a speed of 50 miles per hour. Which vehicle will win in a race?

**Options:**
- **Option 1**: Sedan
- **Option 2**: Garbage truck

## Detailed Solution

To determine which vehicle would win in a race when both accelerate to a speed of 50 miles per hour, we should consider their respective accelerations. However, the weight of the vehicles could indicate their potential acceleration if other factors like engine power are unknown. In the absence of specific acceleration data, we need to compare the vehicles based on the given weights and their ability to reach 50 mph:

1. **Convert the weight of the vehicles to the same unit** for easier comparison. Since 1 kg equals approximately 2.20462 pounds, we convert the sedan's weight from kilograms to pounds.

   \[
   \text{Weight of sedan in pounds} = 1500 \text{ kg} \times 2.20462 \text{ pounds/kg} = 3306.93 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight comparison** is now as follows:
   - Sedan: 3306.93 pounds
   - Garbage Truck: 69632 pounds

3. **Acceleration Insight:**
   - Generally, lighter vehicles can accelerate faster from a stop because they require less force to overcome inertia. Assuming similar engine capabilities, a lighter vehicle like the sedan, at 3306.93 pounds, would typically accelerate faster than the significantly heavier garbage truck at 69632 pounds.

4. **Conclusion and Final Decision:**
   - Given the much lower weight of the sedan compared to the garbage truck, it is likely that the sedan will reach 50 miles per hour faster than the garbage truck, all else being equal.

Two couples load their groceries in their respective carts. Each cart is pulled by a single horse, and both horses have equal strength. The first horse has to carry 98 pounds of food, and the second horse has to carry 34 kilograms of food. Which one will be slower?

### Options:
- Option 1: Horse 1
- Option 2: Horse 2

## Solution:

To compare the loads carried by the two horses, we need to convert them into the same unit. Currently, Horse 1's load is given in pounds and Horse 2's load is in kilograms.

1. **Conversion of Units:**

   - 1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds

2. **Convert 34 kilograms to pounds:**

   \[
   34 \, \text{kg} \times 2.20462 \, \frac{\text{pounds}}{\text{kg}} = 74.95708 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

3. **Compare the Loads:**

   - Horse 1 carries 98 pounds.
   - Horse 2 carries approximately 74.957 pounds.

Since 98 pounds (Horse 1) is greater than 74.957 pounds (Horse 2), Horse 1 carries a heavier load.

4. **Determine Which Horse Will Be Slower:**

   Assuming both horses have equal strength, the horse carrying the heavier load (Horse 1) will be slower due to the greater amount of effort required to pull more weight.

**Conclusion:**
The horse that carries the heavier load will be slower. Therefore, Horse 1, carrying 98 pounds, will be slower than Horse 2, carrying 74.957 pounds.

### Question:
Jasper is taking his niece to the park. His niece is five years older and weighs 30 kilograms, whereas his nephew weighs 20 kilograms. Whose gravitational force will be greater?

### Options:
- Option 1: Niece's
- Option 2: Nephew's

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Gravitational Force:**
   - The gravitational force exerted on an object is directly proportional to its mass. The formula for gravitational force (weight) is given by \( F = mg \), where:
     - \( F \) is the gravitational force,
     - \( m \) is the mass of the object,
     - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, which is constant at approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on the surface of the Earth.

2. **Calculating Gravitational Force:**
   - For the niece:
     - Mass (\( m_1 \)) = 30 kg
     - Gravitational force (\( F_1 \)) = \( m_1 \cdot g = 30 \cdot 9.8 = 294 \, \text{N} \)
   - For the nephew:
     - Mass (\( m_2 \)) = 20 kg
     - Gravitational force (\( F_2 \)) = \( m_2 \cdot g = 20 \cdot 9.8 = 196 \, \text{N} \)

3. **Comparing the Gravitational Forces:**
   - The gravitational force on the niece is 294 N.
   - The gravitational force on the nephew is 196 N.
   - Clearly, 294 N (niece's force) is greater than 196 N (nephew's force).

## Conclusion:
Since the gravitational force on the niece is greater than that on the nephew, the correct answer is:

### Question
If both a car and a pickup truck travel at a speed of 60 miles per hour, but the car stops after 2 hours and the pickup truck stops after 6 hours, which one has traveled a shorter distance?

### Options
- **Option 1**: Car
- **Option 2**: Pickup truck

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled by both the car and the pickup truck. We will use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the car:**

   - Speed of the car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the car: 2 hours

   \[
   \text{Distance traveled by the car} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the pickup truck:**

   - Speed of the pickup truck: 60 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the pickup truck: 6 hours

   \[
   \text{Distance traveled by the pickup truck} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 360 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Compare the distances:**

   - Distance traveled by the car: 120 miles
   - Distance traveled by the pickup truck: 360 miles

   Since 120 miles is less than 360 miles, the car has traveled a shorter distance than the pickup truck.

## Conclusion

The car has traveled a shorter distance compared to the pickup truck. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Question:** Kevin took a flight from New York to Chicago at 09:00 hours and Easter took a flight from New York to Los Angeles at 17:00 hours. They are both traveling on the same type of aircraft, so their speeds are the same. They both arrived at their respective destinations at the same time. Who traveled more?

**Option 1:** Kevin  
**Option 2:** Easter

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kevin's journey is from New York to Chicago.
   - Easter's journey is from New York to Los Angeles.
   - Both are traveling on flights with the same speed, and they arrive at their destinations at the same time.

2. **Time Analysis:**
   - Kevin departs at 09:00 and Easter departs at 17:00 the same day.
   - Both arrive at their destinations at the same time.

3. **Flight Speeds and Arrival Time:**
   - Since they travel on the same type of plane, their speeds (let's denote this speed as \( v \)) are equal.
   - They arrive at their respective destinations at the same time despite starting at different times.

4. **Distance Comparison:**
   - Let the time of arrival for both be \( T \).
   - Kevin's time of travel is \( T - 09:00 \).
   - Easter's time of travel is \( T - 17:00 \).

5. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Since distance \( \text{D} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \),
   - Kevin's travel distance \( D_K = v \times (T - 09:00) \).
   - Easter's travel distance \( D_E = v \times (T - 17:00) \).

6. **Comparison:**
   - Given that they arrived at the same time, Easter had less time to travel (since she departed later).
   - For Easter to arrive at the same time as Kevin, the distance she covered (to Los Angeles) must be greater than the distance Kevin covered (to Chicago), because she had to cover her distance in less time.

7. **Geographical Insight:**
   - Geographically, Los Angeles is farther from New York than Chicago is from New York.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Easter traveled more due to the geographical distance and the conditions of the problem.

John and Steven decided to conduct an experiment. They dropped a brick weighing 800 grams and a pebble weighing 4 grams from a window. When they looked down, they discovered that the pebble reached the ground after the brick. What is the reason?

### Options:
1. The mass of the pebble is less.
2. The mass of the brick is less.

## Step-by-step Solution:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
John and Steven dropped two objects from the same height: a brick weighing 800 grams and a pebble weighing 4 grams. They observed that the pebble took longer to reach the ground compared to the brick.

### Step 2: Concept of Gravitational Force
In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate due to gravity, regardless of their mass. However, in real-world conditions, air resistance plays a role.

### Step 3: Effect of Air Resistance
- **Air resistance** is a force that opposes the motion of an object through air. It is influenced by factors such as the surface area and shape of the object.
- Heavier objects with more mass are less affected by air resistance compared to lighter objects because they have greater gravitational force acting on them, which allows them to overcome air resistance more effectively.

### Step 4: Analyzing the Experiment
- In this experiment, the pebble is significantly lighter than the brick. The greater air resistance acting on the lighter pebble compared to its weight means that the pebble will decelerate more and take longer to fall.
- Thus, the pebble reaching the ground after the brick can be attributed to its lower mass, which makes it more susceptible to air resistance.

### Conclusion:
The pebble's mass being less makes it more affected by air resistance, resulting in a slower fall compared to the brick.

### Question:
When Mary's wagon rolls through the weeds, it reaches a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, and when rolling through the gravel, it reaches a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. Does this mean her wagon is forced to roll slowly?

### Options:
- Option 1: Weeds
- Option 2: Gravel

## Solution:

The problem involves understanding the relationship between temperature and speed. Generally, a higher temperature experienced by an object like a wagon could indicate more friction or conversion of kinetic energy into heat, which usually relates to the surface it moves over.

### Analysis:

- **Rolling Through Weeds (40°C):**
  - The temperature reached by the wagon is 40 degrees Celsius. 
  - This lower temperature suggests less friction, meaning the wagon could potentially roll faster, as there is lesser energy lost as heat.

- **Rolling Through Gravel (50°C):**
  - The temperature is higher at 50 degrees Celsius.
  - A higher temperature implies that there is more friction when rolling over gravel. This energy loss results in more heat being generated, suggesting that the wagon likely rolls more slowly due to increased resistance.

### Conclusion:

The increased temperature observed while rolling over gravel (50°C) compared to weeds (40°C) indicates higher friction, which would typically slow down the wagon. Therefore, the correct inference is that the wagon is forced to roll slowly when traveling over the gravel due to increased resistance.

**Question:** The mass of a golf ball is 158 grams and the mass of a baseball is 0.159 kilograms. Which one has a comparatively greater gravitational force?

**Option 1:** Golf ball's  
**Option 2:** Baseball's

## Detailed Solution:

To determine which object has a greater gravitational force acting on it, we can use the formula for gravitational force (weight):

\[ F = m \times g \]

where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force (weight) in newtons,
- \( m \) is the mass in kilograms,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on Earth.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Convert the masses to the same unit (kilograms):**

   - Mass of the golf ball: 158 grams.
     - Since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams,
     - Therefore, 158 grams = \( \frac{158}{1000} \) kg = 0.158 kg.

   - Mass of the baseball: Already given as 0.159 kg.

2. **Calculate the gravitational force for each object:**

   - **Golf Ball:**
     \[ F_{\text{golf}} = 0.158 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 1.5484 \, \text{N} \]

   - **Baseball:**
     \[ F_{\text{baseball}} = 0.159 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 1.5582 \, \text{N} \]

3. **Comparison of the Gravitational Forces:**

   - Golf Ball: 1.5484 N
   - Baseball: 1.5582 N

The gravitational force acting on the baseball is greater than that on the golf ball because 1.5582 N > 1.5484 N.

## Conclusion:

The baseball has a comparatively greater gravitational force acting on it compared to the golf ball.

Jerin and Mina are both traveling on the highway at the same speed. Jerin drives for 0.65 hours, and Mina drives for 38.50 minutes. Who drives a greater distance?

**Translated Options:**
- Option 1: Mina
- Option 2: Jerin

## Solution

To determine who drives a greater distance, we need to calculate the distance each person covers and compare them. The distance covered is directly proportional to the time driven if the speed is constant.

Let's use the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since both are driving at the same speed, we'll primarily compare the time they have driven.

**Step 1: Convert Time to Same Units**

First, convert Mina's driving time from minutes to hours for direct comparison.

Mina drives for 38.50 minutes. Let's convert this to hours:
\[ 38.50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{38.50}{60} \text{ hours} \]
\[ 38.50 \text{ minutes} = 0.6417 \text{ (approximately to four decimal places) hours} \]

**Step 2: Compare the Times**

Now we have:
- Jerin's driving time: 0.65 hours
- Mina's driving time: 0.6417 hours

The person who drives for a longer time at the same speed will cover more distance. Therefore, we compare the two times.

0.65 hours (Jerin) is greater than 0.6417 hours (Mina).

**Conclusion:**

Since Jerin drives for a longer period of 0.65 hours compared to Mina's 0.6417 hours, Jerin travels a greater distance.

**Question:**
The weight of an F-16 is typically 250,000 pounds, and the weight of a jumbo jet is 500,000 pounds. Therefore, the F-16 is?

**Option 1:** Slow moving  
**Option 2:** Fast moving

## Detailed Solution

To determine whether the F-16 is ""slow moving"" or ""fast moving,"" let's consider the context of aircraft weights and their performance characteristics:

1. **Understanding Aircraft Weight and Performance:**

   - **F-16:**
     - The F-16 is a lightweight, highly maneuverable fighter jet designed primarily for air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attacks. Its typical weight is around 25,000 pounds (Note: There seems to be a discrepancy in the Bengali version mentioning 250,000 pounds, which appears incorrect for an F-16. The correct range is more like 25,000 pounds, as stated here).
   
   - **Jumbo Jet:**
     - A jumbo jet, such as the Boeing 747, is a large commercial airliner designed to carry a significant number of passengers and cargo over long distances. Its weight starts from approximately 400,000 to 500,000 pounds, depending on the model and configuration.

2. **Weight and Speed Correlation:**

   - **F-16 (Fighter Jet):**
     - Being a much lighter aircraft compared to a jumbo jet, the F-16 is engineered for high speeds and agility. Fighter jets are typically equipped with powerful engines that allow them to achieve supersonic speeds (faster than the speed of sound).

   - **Jumbo Jet (Commercial Airliner):**
     - Jumbo jets, being much heavier, are designed for endurance and efficiency at cruising speeds suitable for long-haul flights. They are not designed for rapid acceleration or supersonic speeds.

3. **Conclusion Based on Weight and Design Purpose:**

   - Despite the discrepancy in weight mentioned initially, the F-16 is significantly lighter and specifically designed for high-speed performance and rapid maneuvering in combat situations.
   
   - Therefore, compared to a jumbo jet, the F-16 is indeed ""fast moving.""

Based on this reasoning, the correct assessment of an F-16, vis-à-vis its speed-related characteristics comparing it to a jumbo jet, is that it is **""fast moving.""**

**Question:** If a train travels at 50 miles per hour and a bike travels at 20 miles per hour, then the bike will cover?

**Option 1:** More distance  
**Option 2:** Less distance

## Solution

To determine whether the bike covers more or less distance than the train, we should compare their speeds because both are directly related to the distance covered over the same period of time.

1. **Understanding the Relationship Between Speed and Distance:**
   - The formula for distance is \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).
   - This relationship implies that for a given amount of time, the greater the speed, the greater the distance traveled.

2. **Comparing Speeds:**
   - The speed of the train is given as 50 miles per hour.
   - The speed of the bike is given as 20 miles per hour.

3. **Analyzing the Distances:**
   - Since both the train and the bike are compared over the same duration of time (implicitly by the problem), the key factor is their speeds.
   - With the train moving at 50 miles per hour and the bike at 20 miles per hour, the train travels more rapidly than the bike.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - As the train's speed (50 mph) is greater than the bike's speed (20 mph), for any given time, the train will invariably cover more distance than the bike.
   - Therefore, the bike covers less distance than the train.

The question asks specifically about the bike's travel in comparison to the train, and we have established that the bike will travel less distance.

Question: If Sarah and Jenny both run at the same speed, Sarah runs for 78 minutes and Jenny runs 27 minutes more than Sarah, who has traveled a greater distance?

Option 1: Sarah  
Option 2: Jenny

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Both Sarah and Jenny run at the same speed, which implies that the distance each covers is directly proportional to the time they spend running. 

2. **Analyzing Sarah's Run:**
   - Sarah runs for 78 minutes. This means the distance Sarah covers can be represented as:  
     \[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Sarah}} = \text{Speed} \times 78 \]

3. **Analyzing Jenny's Run:**
   - Jenny runs for 27 minutes more than Sarah. Therefore, the time Jenny runs is:  
     \[ 78 + 27 = 105 \text{ minutes} \]
   - The distance Jenny covers can be represented as:  
     \[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Jenny}} = \text{Speed} \times 105 \]

4. **Comparing Distances:**
   - Since both run at the same speed, we can compare the distances by comparing the time of running directly, as the speed factor cancels out:
     - Sarah's running time: 78 minutes
     - Jenny's running time: 105 minutes

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Jenny has a greater running time (105 minutes > 78 minutes), which means Jenny has traveled a greater distance than Sarah.

**Question:** Mohsin was comparing the mass of a rock and a pebble. He found that the mass of the rock was 129 pounds and the mass of the pebble was 12 pounds. Which one has stronger gravity?

**Option 1:** The rock  
**Option 2:** The pebble

## Detailed Solution:

Gravitational force is proportional to the mass of an object. This means that the larger the mass of an object, the stronger the gravitational pull it exhibits. 

In this context:

- The mass of the rock is 129 pounds.
- The mass of the pebble is 12 pounds.

Since gravitational pull is directly proportional to mass, the object with the greater mass will exhibit a stronger gravitational pull. 

- In this case, the rock, with a mass of 129 pounds, is significantly heavier than the pebble, which weighs only 12 pounds. 

Therefore, the rock with the mass of 129 pounds will exert a stronger gravitational force than the pebble with the mass of 12 pounds.

## Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning, the object with the stronger gravitational pull is the rock.

- **Question:** Beauty Queen crossed the marble floor at a speed of 6 m/s but moved across the wooden floor at a speed of 3 m/s because it was?
- **Option 1:** More resistant
- **Option 2:** Less resistant

**Solution and Explanation:**

Let's break down what is happening in the question:

1. **Speed on Marble Floor:** Beauty Queen moves at a speed of 6 m/s on the marble floor. This implies that the marble floor offers less resistance to her movement relative to the effort she is applying to move.

2. **Speed on Wooden Floor:** She moves at a reduced speed of 3 m/s on the wooden floor. This suggests that the wooden floor offers more resistance to her movement relative to the marble floor.

**Reasoning:**
- The concept of resistance here refers to the frictional force or drag impacting her motion. A surface that offers more resistance means that more energy is required to maintain the same speed, thereby resulting in a slower pace if the energy exerted remains constant.
  
- Conversely, a surface that offers less resistance allows her to maintain a higher speed without needing additional energy.

From the analysis, since her speed is slower on the wooden floor, it logically follows that the wooden floor is more resistant compared to the marble floor.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the reasoning provided, Beauty Queen's reduced speed on the wooden floor indicates that it offers more resistance compared to the marble floor.

### Question:
While driving, Mary found that the coefficient of friction in the jungle is 0.7, where the coefficient in the field is 10% of 1.2. Where does her car move faster?

### Options:
- Option 1: Jungle
- Option 2: Field

## Solution

To determine where Mary’s car moves faster, we need to compare the coefficient of friction values in the jungle and the field. The speed at which a car can move safely is inversely related to the frictional force; lower friction means potentially higher speed if other conditions like power and drag permit.

### Step 1: Determine the coefficient of friction for the field.
- The problem states that the field's coefficient of friction is 10% of 1.2. 
  \[
  \text{Field coefficient of friction} = 10\% \times 1.2 = \frac{10}{100} \times 1.2 = 0.12
  \]

### Step 2: Compare the coefficients of friction.
- Jungle coefficient of friction provided: \(0.7\)
- Field coefficient of friction calculated: \(0.12\)

### Step 3: Interpret the relationship between friction and speed.
- Generally, less friction means less resistance and allows potentially higher speed until the point of losing grip.
- Field: Coefficient of friction is \(0.12\)
- Jungle: Coefficient of friction is \(0.7\)

Since frictional force in the field (0.12) is much less than in the jungle (0.7), the car can move faster in the field.

## Conclusion
Mary's car will move faster in the field because it has a lower coefficient of friction (0.12) as compared to the jungle (0.7).

   - **Question:** Mohsin and Musa both left at exactly the same time, that is, at 12 noon, and drive their cars at the same speed. Mohsin drives for several hours and stops at 12 midnight while Musa stops at 10 PM. Who traveled the most distance?
   - **Option 1:** Musa
   - **Option 2:** Mohsin

2. **Solution with Explanations:**

   To determine who traveled the most distance, we need to calculate the duration each person drove, considering they both drive at the same speed.

   - **Mohsin:**
     - Start time: 12 noon
     - Stop time: 12 midnight
     - Duration of travel: From 12 noon to 12 midnight = 12 hours

   - **Musa:**
     - Start time: 12 noon
     - Stop time: 10 PM
     - Duration of travel: From 12 noon to 10 PM = 10 hours

   Since both Mohsin and Musa drive at the same speed, the distance traveled by each is directly proportional to the time they spent driving.

   - **Distance traveled by Mohsin = Speed × Time = Speed × 12 hours**
   - **Distance traveled by Musa = Speed × Time = Speed × 10 hours**

   Clearly, since 12 hours is greater than 10 hours, Mohsin drove for a longer duration, meaning he traveled a greater distance.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Based on the given information, Mohsin traveled the most distance.

Bob sent a package via USPS and a package via UPS. The package he sent via UPS arrived within 4 days and the package via USPS arrived within 2 weeks. Which parcel service was slower?

### Options:
1. USPS was slower
2. UPS was slower

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert the Delivery Times to the Same Unit:**
   - The time for the UPS delivery is already in days: 4 days.
   - The USPS delivery time is given in weeks. In order to compare, we need to convert weeks into days. There are 7 days in a week.

2. **Calculate the USPS Delivery Time in Days:**
   - USPS delivery time = 2 weeks = 2 * 7 days = 14 days.

3. **Compare the Delivery Times:**
   - UPS took 4 days to deliver the package.
   - USPS took 14 days to deliver the package.

4. **Determine which Service was Slower:**
   - Since it took longer for USPS to deliver the package (14 days) compared to UPS (4 days), USPS is the slower service.

## Conclusion:

After comparing the delivery times, it is clear that USPS took more days to deliver the package than UPS. Therefore, USPS was slower.

**Question in English:** A cheetah runs at a speed of 34 miles per hour and a dog runs at a speed of 12 miles per hour. Therefore, how much time will the cheetah take?

**Options:**
1. Option 1: Less time
2. Option 2: More time

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the time taken by the cheetah compared to the dog when they travel the same distance. The formula relating speed, distance, and time is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Using this formula, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Speed of the Cheetah:** 34 miles per hour
2. **Speed of the Dog:** 12 miles per hour

We need to compare the time each animal takes to cover a fixed distance, say, \(D\) miles. The time taken by each animal to travel the distance \(D\) is calculated as follows:

- **Time taken by the Cheetah:**
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Cheetah}} = \frac{D}{34}
  \]

- **Time taken by the Dog:**
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Dog}} = \frac{D}{12}
  \]

Now, let's compare these times:

- To see which is less, compare \(\frac{D}{34}\) and \(\frac{D}{12}\).
- We observe that:
  - \(\frac{1}{34} < \frac{1}{12}\) because 34 is greater than 12.

This shows that \(\frac{D}{34} < \frac{D}{12}\) for any positive distance \(D\).

Thus, the cheetah, which runs at a faster speed, will take less time to cover the same distance compared to the dog, which runs slower.

### Conclusion:

The cheetah takes **less time** than the dog to cover the same distance.

**Question:** The horse moves at a speed of 120 cm/second on the derby track and at 3.5 meters/second in the forest because in the forest there is?

- **Option 1:** More obstacles
- **Option 2:** Fewer obstacles

## Solution

### Step 1: Convert Units
Firstly, let's convert the speed from cm/second to meters/second for consistency in comparison:

- Derby track speed: \(120 \, \text{cm/second} = 1.2 \, \text{meters/second}\)
  
So, the horse's speed:
- On the derby track is \(1.2 \, \text{m/s}\)
- In the forest is \(3.5 \, \text{m/s}\)

### Step 2: Compare Speeds
The horse travels faster in the forest (\(3.5 \, \text{m/s}\)) compared to the derby track (\(1.2 \, \text{m/s}\)).

### Step 3: Reasoning About Obstacles
A higher speed typically indicates:
- Fewer obstacles because the horse can maintain a higher speed without needing to slow down or navigate around things.

### Conclusion
Since the horse moves faster in the forest, it suggests that the forest has fewer obstacles allowing the horse to move at a higher speed compared to the derby track.

Thus, the correct reasoning according to the given speed differences is:
