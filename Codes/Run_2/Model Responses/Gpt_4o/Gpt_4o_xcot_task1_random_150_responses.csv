Tahsaan bought 2.5 dozen eggs at a price of 120 BDT per dozen from a shop and went home. Upon reaching home, he found that 3 eggs were spoiled. What is the financial loss incurred by Tahsaan?

### Solution

To find out how much monetary loss Tahsaan experienced, we need to first calculate the cost of the 3 spoiled eggs.

1. **Cost of 1 Dozen Eggs**:  
   The price of 1 dozen eggs is 120 BDT.

2. **Cost of 2.5 Dozen Eggs**:  
   \[
   \text{Cost for 2.5 dozen eggs} = 120 \, \text{BDT/dozen} \times 2.5 = 300 \, \text{BDT}
   \]

3. **Total Number of Eggs Purchased**:  
   1 dozen equals 12 eggs, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of eggs in 2.5 dozen} = 12 \, \text{eggs/dozen} \times 2.5 = 30 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

4. **Cost per Egg**:  
   Since 2.5 dozen (or 30 eggs) cost 300 BDT:
   \[
   \text{Cost per egg} = \frac{300 \, \text{BDT}}{30 \, \text{eggs}} = 10 \, \text{BDT/egg}
   \]

5. **Cost of the 3 Spoiled Eggs**:  
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 spoiled eggs} = 10 \, \text{BDT/egg} \times 3 \, \text{eggs} = 30 \, \text{BDT}
   \]

Therefore, the financial loss to Tahsaan due to the 3 spoiled eggs is 30 BDT.

Soni started donating 8,000 Taka to an organization on her 17th birthday. Yesterday, Soni turned 71 years old. How many thousands of Taka has Soni donated in total?

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of years Soni donated:**
   - Soni started donating at the age of 17.
   - Yesterday, Soni turned 71 years old.
   - Therefore, the total number of years for donations = \(71 - 17 = 54\) years.

2. **Calculate the total amount donated:**
   - Soni donates 8,000 Taka every year.
   - For 54 years, the total donation amount is \(8,000 \text{ Taka/year} \times 54 \text{ years}\).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(8,000 \times 54 = 432,000\) Taka.

4. **Convert the total donation into thousands of Taka:**
   - Since the question asks for the amount in thousands, we divide the total amount by 1,000 to obtain that value in thousands:

Brooklyn donates 1453 Taka to a charity every month. Calculate her total donation in one year.

## Solution:

To find out the total donation in one year, we need to determine how many months make up a year and then multiply Brooklyn's monthly donation by that number. 

Step-by-step, the calculation is as follows:

1. **Determine the number of months in a year:**  
   There are 12 months in a year.

2. **Calculate the total donation for the year:**  
   Brooklyn donates 1453 Taka each month. To find the total for the year, we multiply the monthly donation amount by the number of months in a year:

   \[
   \text{Total Donation per Year} = \text{Monthly Donation} \times \text{Number of Months in a Year}
   \]

   Substituting in the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total Donation per Year} = 1453 \times 12
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**

   - Break it down:
     \[
     1453 \times 12 = (1453 \times 10) + (1453 \times 2)
     \]

   - Calculate each part:
     \[
     1453 \times 10 = 14530
     \]
     \[
     1453 \times 2 = 2906
     \]

   - Add these results together:
     \[
     14530 + 2906 = 17436
     \]

So, Brooklyn's total donation over one year is 17,436 Taka.

   Abir brought two and a half dozen eggs from the store to his home. Upon reaching home, he found that 3 eggs were bad. How many good eggs does Abir have?

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations:**

   To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs Abir initially had and then how many of those were good after finding some were bad.

   - First, let's convert the count from dozens to individual eggs. Since a dozen contains 12 eggs, ""two and a half dozen"" means 2.5 dozen eggs.
   
   - Calculate the number of eggs in 2.5 dozen:
     \[
     2.5 \times 12 = 30
     \]
     So, Abir initially brought 30 eggs home.

   - According to the problem, Abir discovered that 3 eggs were bad. To determine how many good eggs are left, we need to subtract the number of bad eggs from the total number of eggs he brought.
   
   - Calculate the number of good eggs:
     \[
     30 - 3 = 27

In a parking lot, Grayson noticed that there are 48 wheels from cars. How many cars are in the parking lot?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the total number of wheels in the parking lot, which is 48 wheels.
   - We need to find out how many cars are in the parking lot.

2. **Basic Assumptions and Formulation:**
   - A typical car has 4 wheels.
   - Let the number of cars be denoted by \( x \).

3. **Setting up the Equation:**
   - Since each car has 4 wheels, if there are \( x \) cars, then the total number of wheels can be represented by \( 4x \).
   - According to the problem, the total number of wheels is 48, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     4x = 48
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{48}{4}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 12

A machine is cutting branches and processing apples. If I see 204 branches after 6 hours, how many apples have been processed?

## Solution:
To find the number of apples processed, we need to understand the operations of the machine. However, from the problem provided, some specific information is missing - such as the rate at which branches are cut and apples are processed. Given this crucial piece of information is unknown, we can proceed generally as follows:

1. Let's assume the machine processes tasks at a constant rate, dealing with branches and apples. If only the number of branches is known after 6 hours, we can infer there might be a separate calculation or experiment to determine or estimate the rate of processing apples.

2. Hypothetically, consider that each task is distinct and occurs at a separate rate. This implies the machine, over 6 hours, performs a measurable quantity of tasks which together sum to the total work done i.e., 204 branches.

Without any further details on apple processing or given rates, a robust numerical analysis cannot be completed. There is direct information missing that would allow us to deduce values for apples, if assumed to be processed.

Since the problem only provides complete data related to branches, it indicates a potentially straightforward inherent task assumption or an error. Given apples' processing quantity is not calculable from the provided information in isolation, a general setting doesn't solve unknowns without additional data or constraints.

## Conclusion:
In this context, seeing as only branches' information is provided, it is not directly solveable to find ""how many apples were processed?"" without supplementing assumptions or additional relations being detailed. More data or precise instructions about machine function division are necessary to proceed accurately.

There are three bells, each of a different color. The red bell rings every 18 minutes, the yellow bell rings every 15 minutes, and the green bell rings every 12 minutes. If the bells start ringing together at 6 PM, at what time will they next ring together again?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To find when the bells will ring together again, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the ringing intervals of the three bells. The intervals given are 18 minutes, 15 minutes, and 12 minutes.

1. **Find the Prime Factorization:**
   - 18 = 2 × 3²
   - 15 = 3 × 5
   - 12 = 2² × 3

2. **Determine the LCM:**
   - Take the highest power of all prime numbers present in the factorizations:
     - The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\) from 12.
     - The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\) from 18.
     - The highest power of 5 is \(5^1\) from 15.

3. **Calculate the LCM:**
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
   \]
   \[
   = 4 \times 9 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   = 36 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   = 180
   \]

4. **Convert the LCM into Time:**
   - The LCM is 180 minutes, which is equivalent to 3 hours (since \(180 \div 60 = 3\)).

5. **Determine the Time They Ring Together:**
   - The bells start together at 6 PM.
   - Adding 3 hours to 6 PM, we find that they will ring together again at 9 PM.

Jamshed has a full deck of 50 playing cards in his pocket. How many spades does he have in total?

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Understanding a Standard Deck**:
   - A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards. This is typically divided into 4 suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Each suit has 13 cards (Ace through King).

2. **Verifying the Given Deck**:
   - The problem states that Jamshed has a deck of 50 cards. This is unusual, as a standard deck has 52 cards. However, for calculating the number of spades based on the composition of a standard deck, I'll assume that the given deck is similar in distribution but with 50 cards for this scenario.

3. **Calculating the Number of Spades**:
   - Normally, each suit in a 52-card deck has 13 cards. If we assume a proportional reduction to fit a 50-card deck, we can calculate the expected number of cards per suit by dividing the deck evenly.
   
   - Assuming uniform distribution, the number of cards per suit in a 50-card deck would be approximately equal:

     \[
     \text{Cards per suit} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5
     \]

   - Since it isn't possible to have half a card, there can be a slight variation, but generally, in most 'truncated' decks, suits are reduced evenly or specific rules are applied regarding which cards are removed.

4. **Making an Assumption**:
   - Without additional rules specifying how the deck is truncated, the problem seems to be on the assumption that the deck still maintains the normal suit structure as closely as possible.
   
   - Typically, this reduction might be interpreted as either having 12 or 13 cards, as most truncated decks with even distribution still consider maintaining 13 cards for specific suits and slightly reducing others to 12 to reach 50.

5. **Concluding the Count**:
   - Given typical gaming conventions, assume the count remains close to normal unless otherwise specified. Therefore, in the absence of detail, assume the spades count remains usual for similar contexts, aligned for a standard deck used typically.

Thus, based on a standard understanding and gaming practice, without any further information or context on how the 50-card deck is reconciled or which cards were removed, we consider the standard:

   In a factory, 2450 motorcycles are produced in 5 days. How many motorcycles will be produced in that factory in 4 weeks?

2. **Step-by-step Solution:**

   - First, let's determine how many days are there in 4 weeks:
     - We know that 1 week consists of 7 days.
     - Therefore, 4 weeks consist of \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) days.

   - We know from the problem that the production rate is 2450 motorcycles in 5 days. We need to find out the number of motorcycles produced in one day to determine the total production in 28 days.
   
     \[
     \text{Production per day} = \frac{2450 \text{ motorcycles}}{5 \text{ days}} = 490 \text{ motorcycles/day}
     \]

   - Now that we know the daily production rate is 490 motorcycles, we can calculate the total production in 28 days:
   
     \[
     \text{Total production in 28 days} = 490 \text{ motorcycles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 13720 \text{ motorcycles}
     \]

The problem is asking to find the total number of minutes when adding two time durations together: (2 hours 45 minutes) + (1 hour 52 minutes).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert Hours to Minutes:**
   - First, we need to convert the hours into minutes because the final answer should be in minutes.
   - 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.

2. **Convert Each Time Duration:**
   - Convert 2 hours 45 minutes into minutes:
     - 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes
     - Adding the minutes: 120 minutes + 45 minutes = 165 minutes

   - Convert 1 hour 52 minutes into minutes:
     - 1 hour = 1 × 60 = 60 minutes
     - Adding the minutes: 60 minutes + 52 minutes = 112 minutes

3. **Add the Two Time Durations:**
   - Now add the total minutes from both durations:
     - 165 minutes + 112 minutes = 277 minutes

Today, I left home at 10:20 AM for school. I returned home at 4:20 PM. Calculate how many hours I was outside the home today.

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Time Format:**
   - The start time when I left home is 10:20 AM.
   - The end time when I returned home is 4:20 PM.

2. **Converting Time to a 24-hour Format for Easier Calculation:**
   - 10:20 AM in 24-hour format remains the same as 10:20.
   - 4:20 PM in 24-hour format is 16:20.

3. **Calculating the Difference in Hours and Minutes:**
   - We now calculate the time spent outside by finding the difference between the end time and the start time.
   - Start Time: 10:20
   - End Time: 16:20

4. **Breaking Down the Calculation:**
   - To calculate the time difference, subtract the start time from the end time:
     - Convert both times to minutes from the start of the day:
       - Start Time: \(10 \times 60 + 20 = 620\) minutes
       - End Time: \(16 \times 60 + 20 = 980\) minutes
     - Difference in time: \(980 - 620 = 360\) minutes

5. **Convert Minutes Back to Hours and Minutes:**
   - 360 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{360}{60} = 6 \) hours.

## Conclusion

The total time spent outside the home today is **6 hours**.

In a farm, there are 8 animals. Some are ducks and some are dogs. The total number of legs is 24. How many ducks are there?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of the 8 animals are ducks and how many are dogs, given that ducks have 2 legs each and dogs have 4 legs each. Let's define:
- \( d \) as the number of ducks
- \( g \) as the number of dogs

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information which yield two equations:

1. The total number of animals is 8:
   \[
   d + g = 8
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 24:
   \[
   2d + 4g = 24
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations. We will solve this system using substitution or elimination methods. Let's use substitution:

From the first equation, express \( g \) in terms of \( d \):
\[
g = 8 - d
\]

Substitute \( g = 8 - d \) into the second equation:
\[
2d + 4(8 - d) = 24
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2d + 32 - 4d = 24
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
-2d + 32 = 24
\]

Subtract 32 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( d \):
\[
-2d = 24 - 32
\]
\[
-2d = -8
\]

Divide both sides by -2 to solve for \( d \):
\[
d = 4
\]

So, there are 4 ducks.

To confirm, substitute \( d = 4 \) back into the equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 8 - d = 8 - 4 = 4
\]

Therefore, there are 4 ducks and 4 dogs.

Finally, verify the total number of legs:
- Ducks: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) legs
- Dogs: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) legs
- Total: \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) legs, which matches the problem statement.

Thus, the calculation is correct.

Rahim has 3 complete decks of playing cards. How many Aces does he have in total?

## Solution

To solve this problem, let's first break down the structure of a standard deck of playing cards:

1. A standard deck of playing cards contains 52 cards.
2. Each deck is divided into 4 suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.
3. Each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King.
4. Therefore, in each suit, there is exactly one Ace.

Now, let's determine the total number of Aces in a single deck:
- Since there are 4 suits and each suit has 1 Ace, a single deck contains 4 Aces.

Rahim has 3 complete decks, so we need to calculate the total number of Aces across all 3 decks:

- If 1 deck has 4 Aces, then 3 decks will have:
  \[
  3 \text{ decks} \times 4 \text{ Aces per deck} = 12 \text{ Aces}
  \]

Thus, Rahim has 12 Aces in total across his 3 decks of playing cards.

Cooper and Audrey began watching a three-hour movie. They paused the movie exactly halfway through. How many minutes will it take to watch the remainder of the movie?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Understand the Total Duration of the Movie:**
   - The movie is 3 hours long.

2. **Convert Hours to Minutes:**
   - Since each hour consists of 60 minutes, multiply 3 hours by 60 to find the total duration in minutes.
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}

3. **Determine the Halfway Point in Minutes:**
   - The halfway point of the movie is half of the total duration.
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Remaining Time to Watch:**
   - Since they paused the movie halfway through, they have already watched 90 minutes. The remaining time will be the total minutes minus the minutes already watched.
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes total} - 90 \text{ minutes watched} = 90 \text{ minutes remaining}

   After Kader's laptop is fully charged at 4:12 PM, Kader starts watching a 7-hour series. Kader continues watching the series until the laptop's battery is completely drained at 10:43 PM. How many minutes are left for Kader to finish watching the series?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   Let's break down the problem and find out how long Kader watched the series before the laptop battery ran out, and then determine how much of the series is left.

   - **Determine the end time after a 7-hour series from 4:12 PM:**

     If Kader watches the series for 7 full hours continuously starting from 4:12 PM, the end time would be calculated as follows:

     \[
     4:12 \text{ PM} + 7 \text{ hours} = 11:12 \text{ PM}
     \]

     Normally, the 7-hour series should finish by 11:12 PM.

   - **Determine the total watch time until the battery is drained:**

     Given that the laptop's battery is drained at 10:43 PM, we need to compute how long Kader actually watched the series before the battery ran out.

     - Time duration from 4:12 PM to 10:43 PM:
     
     \[
     \text{From 4:12 PM to 10:12 PM is 6 hours}
     \]

     \[
     \text{From 10:12 PM to 10:43 PM is 31 minutes}
     \]

     Therefore, the total time Kader watched is:

     \[
     6 \text{ hours and } 31 \text{ minutes} = 6 \times 60 + 31 = 391 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - **Calculate the remaining duration of the series:**

     The total duration of the series is 7 hours, which is:

     \[
     7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ minutes}
     \]

     The remaining time to finish the series is:

     \[
     420 \text{ minutes} - 391 \text{ minutes} = 29 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   Kader has 29 minutes of the series left to watch.

Anthony bought a dozen bananas. He ate 2 bananas. How many are left now?

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to understand the situation clearly:

1. **Initial Quantity**: Anthony bought a dozen bananas. 
   - A ""dozen"" refers to a group of twelve items. Therefore, Anthony initially had 12 bananas.

2. **Bananas Consumed**: Anthony ate 2 bananas.
   - This means we need to subtract 2 bananas from the initial total.

3. **Calculation**: We subtract the number of bananas eaten from the initial number of bananas to find out how many are left:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial bananas)} - 2 \text{ (bananas eaten)} = 10 \text{ (bananas remaining)}
   \]

Therefore, after eating 2 bananas, Anthony has 10 bananas left.

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Emily has in total, including the toys for her siblings.

1. **Identify the number of toys in Emily's box:**
   - The problem states that Emily has a toy representing each digit of our number system.
   - Our number system consists of the digits 0 through 9.
   - Therefore, Emily's box contains 10 toys (one for each digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

2. **Consider the toy boxes for the siblings:**
   - Emily has 3 additional toy boxes for her siblings.
   - We are not given specific information about the contents of these sibling boxes, but the implication is that they are similar to Emily's box since they are for her ""siblings.""
   - Therefore, we assume each of these boxes also contains toys representing each digit of the number system, hence 10 toys each.

3. **Calculate the total number of toys:**
   - Emily's box: 10 toys
   - Siblings' boxes: 3 boxes × 10 toys per box = 30 toys

4. **Add them up:**
   - Total number of toys = Toys in Emily's box + Toys in siblings' boxes

Karim wants to change his 14 pairs of shoes. If the exchange cost is 37 taka per shoe, how much money does Karim have to pay?

## Detailed Solution

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Shoes
Since Karim has 14 pairs of shoes, we need to find out the total number of individual shoes. 

The number of shoes in one pair is 2, so:
\[ \text{Total number of shoes} = 14 \times 2 = 28 \]

### Step 2: Determine the Cost per Shoe
We are given that the cost to exchange each shoe is 37 taka.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost
To find out how much Karim has to pay in total, we multiply the total number of shoes by the cost per shoe:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 28 \times 37 \]

Break down the multiplication for clarity:
- Calculate \( 28 \times 30 = 840 \)
- Calculate \( 28 \times 7 = 196 \)
- Sum the intermediate results: \( 840 + 196 = 1036 \)

Thus, the total amount Karim needs to pay is 1036 taka.

When a nail is cut, a nail cutter makes a specific kind of sound. For all the fingers of 7 people, how many times will this sound occur?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve the problem, we first need to know how many nails are being cut. Each person has 10 fingers (assuming they have fingers on both hands and no fingers are missing or extra). Therefore, for one person, the nail cutter makes the sound 10 times because each finger's nail is cut once.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of nails for 7 people.**

- Each person = 10 fingers
- Number of people = 7

Hence, the total number of nails is:
\[ 10 \text{ nails/person} \times 7 \text{ people} = 70 \text{ nails} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of sounds made by the nail cutter.**

Since each nail cut results in one sound and there are 70 nails to be cut:

The total number of sounds made by the nail cutter is:
\[ 70 \text{ sounds} \]

Thus, when cutting the nails of all 7 people, the nail cutter makes the sound 70 times.

In a farm, there are a total of 48 animal legs and 15 animals. Some are ducks and some are horses. Determine the number of horses.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote:
- The number of ducks as \( D \)
- The number of horses as \( H \)

### Step 1: Set up the equations
We know the following from the problem statement:
1. The total number of animals (ducks and horses combined) is 15.
   
   \[
   D + H = 15
   \]

2. Ducks have 2 legs each, and horses have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 48.

   \[
   2D + 4H = 48
   \]

### Step 2: Simplify the equations
From equation 1, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( H \):

\[
D = 15 - H
\]

Substitute the value of \( D \) from this equation into equation 2:

\[
2(15 - H) + 4H = 48
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( H \)
First, expand the terms:

\[
30 - 2H + 4H = 48
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
30 + 2H = 48
\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2H = 18
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
H = 9
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, there are 9 horses on the farm.

   Emery wants to change 17 pairs of shoes. If the cost of changing is 29 units of currency per shoe, how much does she need to pay?

2. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   - **Identify the total number of shoes:**
     Emery has 17 pairs of shoes that need changing. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes is calculated by multiplying the number of pairs by 2.
     \[
     \text{Total number of shoes} = 17 \times 2 = 34
     \]

   - **Determine the cost per shoe:**
     It is given that the cost to change each shoe is 29 units of currency.

   - **Calculate the total cost:**
     To find out the total cost, multiply the total number of shoes by the cost per shoe.
     \[

     \]

   - **Perform the multiplication:**
     Let's break down the multiplication for clarity:
     
     \[
     34 \times 29 = 34 \times (30 - 1) = 34 \times 30 - 34 \times 1
     \]

     - First, calculate \(34 \times 30\):
       \[
       34 \times 30 = 34 \times (3 \times 10) = (34 \times 3) \times 10 = 102 \times 10 = 1020
       \]

     - Next, calculate \(34 \times 1\):
       \[
       34 \times 1 = 34
       \]

     - Subtract the second result from the first:

The problem in Bengali is translated into English as:
""What is the result in minutes of (2 hours 45 minutes) - (1 hour 52 minutes)?""

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Convert hours to minutes for both time periods:**

   - For the first time period:  
     \(2\) hours \(45\) minutes is converted as follows:
     \[
     2 \, \text{hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \, \text{minutes}
     \]
     Therefore, total minutes for the first time period:
     \[
     120 \, \text{minutes} + 45 \, \text{minutes} = 165 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

   - For the second time period:  
     \(1\) hour \(52\) minutes is converted as follows:
     \[
     1 \, \text{hour} = 1 \times 60 = 60 \, \text{minutes}
     \]
     Therefore, total minutes for the second time period:
     \[
     60 \, \text{minutes} + 52 \, \text{minutes} = 112 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

2. **Subtract the minutes of the second time period from the first:**
   \[
   165 \, \text{minutes} - 112 \, \text{minutes} = 53 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the result of the subtraction \((2 \, \text{hours} \, 45 \, \text{minutes}) - (1 \, \text{hour} \, 52 \, \text{minutes})\) is \(53\) minutes.

Elias instructs every student in the class to sketch a Roman numeral according to their roll number. The student with roll number 1 will sketch the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 will sketch the second Roman numeral, and so on. Finally, Elias collects all the sketches and sees that there are 6 sketches for each Roman numeral. How many students were there in the class?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   - Each student in the class is assigned to sketch a Roman numeral corresponding to their roll number.
   - There are 6 sketches for each Roman numeral, implying that each Roman numeral sketched has been done by 6 different students.

2. **Determine the Distribution:**
   - The question states that every Roman numeral has been sketched 6 times. This means that if there are 'n' Roman numerals sketched, then there are 6 students per Roman numeral.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Students:**
   - If each Roman numeral is sketched by 6 students, and assuming that Roman numerals are distributed sequentially from the start (I, II, III, etc.), then the total number of students is 6 times the number of different Roman numerals.

4. **Identifying the Roman Numerals:**
   - Assuming students sketch Roman numerals starting from ""I"" upwards, we need to determine how many distinct Roman numerals were sketched. 
   - The problem does not explicitly specify the highest Roman numeral sketched, but since every Roman numeral has been sketched 6 times, the number of Roman numerals is precisely the number of unique sketches made.

5. **Formulate the Total Sketch Logic:**
   - Let's denote the number of distinct Roman numerals sketched as 'n'.
   - Therefore, if there are 'n' Roman numerals and each numeral has been drawn by 6 students, then the total number of students is given by:
     \[
     \text{Total number of students} = 6 \times n
     \]

6. **Concluding Information:**
   - There are no additional constraints, so to find the actual number, knowledge of how many Roman numerals in sequence were sketched is paramount.
   - Considering no upper limit other than each has 6 sketches, 'n' values balance out evenly to indicate all students drawing in sequences, thus indicating distinct in incremental sequence without gaps or extra assignments."

## Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many players played the match based on the total number of socks. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Relationship**:
   - Each player wears a pair of socks during the match, meaning each player contributes 2 socks to the washing machine.

2. **Expressing the Problem Mathematically**:
   - Let \( n \) represent the number of players.
   - Since each player contributes 2 socks, the total number of socks contributed by \( n \) players is \( 2 \times n \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the total number of socks in the washing machine is 16.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
     \[
     2n = 16
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation**:
   - To find \( n \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Harper decides to go to an animal farm nearby where there are a total of 11 animals. She stands in a line near the entrance gate and can see the legs of the animals on the farm, counting 30 legs in total. She already knows that there are only ducks and horses on this farm. Determine the number of horses using this information.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) be the number of ducks.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of horses.

2. **Establish the Relationships:**
   - From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
     - There are 11 animals in total: 
       \[
       D + H = 11
       \]
     - The total number of legs is 30. Ducks have 2 legs and horses have 4 legs, so:
       \[
       2D + 4H = 30
       \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   Let's solve these equations step-by-step.

   - First, from the first equation, express \( D \) in terms of \( H \):
     \[
     D = 11 - H
     \]

   - Substitute \( D = 11 - H \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(11 - H) + 4H = 30
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( H \):
     \[
     22 - 2H + 4H = 30
     \]
     \[
     22 + 2H = 30
     \]
     \[
     2H = 30 - 22
     \]
     \[
     2H = 8
     \]
     \[
     H = 4
     \]

4. **Verification:**

   Let's use the number of horses to find the number of ducks and verify the total number of legs.

   - If \( H = 4 \), then using \( D = 11 - H \):
     \[
     D = 11 - 4 = 7
     \]

   - Check the total number of legs:
     - Ducks: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) legs
     - Horses: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) legs

Asha is a teacher. She instructs each student in her class to sketch a Roman numeral corresponding to their roll number. The student with roll number 1 will sketch the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 will sketch the second Roman numeral, and so on. Finally, Asha collects all the sketches and observes that there are 5 sketches of each Roman numeral. How many students were there in the class?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students are there in Asha's class based on the information provided about the Roman numeral sketches.

1. **Interpretation:**
   - Each student is associated with a unique roll number and is required to sketch the Roman numeral corresponding to that roll number.
   - There are 5 sketches for each Roman numeral. This implies that for each distinct Roman numeral, there are 5 students assigned to sketch it.

2. **Understanding Roman Numerals:**
   - The Roman numerals correspond directly to the roll numbers which are positive integers starting from 1.
   - The sequence of roll numbers 1, 2, 3,...n corresponds to Roman numerals I, II, III, ..., n.

3. **Sketch Count Implication:**
   - Since there are 5 sketches of each Roman numeral, each distinct numeral corresponds to 5 students.
   - The Roman numeral sequence continues in a straightforward series starting from I and going up to the numeral equivalent to the total number of different roll numbers.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Let's assume there are 'n' different Roman numerals, meaning students sketched Roman numerals from I to n.
   - Since there are 5 sketches per numeral, the total number of students is given by `5 * n`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that each numeral from I through n is sketched by 5 students, and no numerals are skipped, the total number of students in the class is simply:
     \[
     \text{Total Number of Students} = 5 \times n
     \]
   - Here `n` is the number of unique Roman numerals, equating directly to the number of different roll numbers.

Given that the problem does not specify 'n' directly, but only states the repeated count, we understand the generic relationship but lack an explicit figure unless 'n' is known from context or further information. Typically, the question appears to ask acknowledgment of the"

From a bus station, Company A's bus leaves every 15 minutes, and Company B's bus leaves every 25 minutes. If both companies' buses leave together at 8:45 AM, when will they next leave together in the morning?

### Step-by-step Solution:
To determine when both buses will leave the station together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two intervals: 15 minutes for Company A and 25 minutes for Company B. This LCM will tell us how often both buses leave together from the station.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 15 can be factorized to \(3 \times 5\).
   - 25 can be factorized to \(5 \times 5\).

2. **Finding the LCM:**
   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number appearing in the factorizations.
   - For \(3\), it appears as \(3^1\) in 15.
   - For \(5\), it appears as \(5^2\) in 25 (the highest power between 15 and 25 factorizations).
   - Therefore, the LCM is \(3^1 \times 5^2 = 3 \times 25 = 75\).

3. **Calculating the Next Meeting Time:**
   - The LCM is 75 minutes. This means both buses will meet again 75 minutes after 8:45 AM.
   - Convert 75 minutes into hours and minutes:
     - 1 hour = 60 minutes, leaving a remainder: \(75 - 60 = 15\) minutes.
   - Add this time to 8:45 AM:
     - Adding 1 hour to 8:45 AM gives us 9:45 AM.
     - Adding 15 minutes to 9:45 AM results in 10:00 AM.

Thus, the next time both buses leave together will be 10:00 AM.

   If Grayson spends 40 taka on fuel this week, and each refueling costs 10 taka, how many times did he refuel?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   - We are given that the total amount Grayson spent on fuel is 40 taka.
   - The cost of refueling once is 10 taka.
   
   To find how many times Grayson refueled, we need to determine the number of 10-taka refuelings that sum up to 40 taka. This can be represented mathematically as:

   \[
   \text{Number of refuelings} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per refueling}}
   \]

   Substituting the given values, we have:

   \[
   \text{Number of refuelings} = \frac{40}{10}
   \]
   
   - Dividing 40 by 10 gives us 4.

   Therefore, Grayson refueled 4 times during the week.

The problem is as follows: After Hannah's laptop was fully charged at 3:20 PM, she started watching a series for 3 hours. As the battery completely discharged, Hannah's laptop shut down at 5:44 PM. How many minutes of the movie does Hannah have left to watch?

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to comprehend the times given and the duration Hannah intended to watch the series.

1. **Understand the timeline:**
   - Hannah’s laptop fully charged at 3:20 PM.
   - She started watching a series for 3 hours, which means she intended to finish watching by 6:20 PM (3:20 PM + 3 hours).

2. **Identify the shutdown time:**
   - The laptop shuts down when the battery is fully discharged at 5:44 PM.

3. **Calculate the actual watching duration:**
   - Start time: 3:20 PM
   - Shutdown time: 5:44 PM
   - Duration = Shutdown time - Start time

   To calculate this, convert the times to minutes:
   - 3:20 PM is \(3 \times 60 + 20 = 200\) minutes past noon.
   - 5:44 PM is \(5 \times 60 + 44 = 344\) minutes past noon.

   Thus, the actual duration Hannah watched the movie before the laptop shut down is:

   \[
   344 - 200 = 144 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Determine the planned watching time:**
   - Hannah intended to watch for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes (3 hours × 60 minutes/hour).

5. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Remaining time = Planned watching time - Actual watching time
   - Remaining time = 180 minutes - 144 minutes = 36 minutes

Therefore, Hannah has 36 minutes of the movie left to watch.

In a farm, there are 38 animal legs and a total of 12 animals. Some are chickens and some are sheep. Determine the number of chickens.

### Solution:
To solve this problem, we will use the concept of systems of equations, as we have two different types of animals (chickens and sheep), and we know the total number of animals and the total number of legs.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( s \) be the number of sheep.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know there are 12 animals in total:
     \[
     c + s = 12
     \]

   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and sheep have 4 legs each. We know there is a total of 38 legs:
     \[
     2c + 4s = 38
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:

   \[
   c + 2s = 19
   \]

   Now we have the following system of equations:

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   c + s &= 12 \hspace{1cm} (1) \\
   c + 2s &= 19 \hspace{1cm} (2)
   \end{align*}
   \]

   Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

   \[
   (c + 2s) - (c + s) = 19 - 12
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   s = 7
   \]

   Now that we know there are 7 sheep, we can substitute \( s = 7 \) back into equation (1):

   \[
   c + 7 = 12
   \]

   Solving for \( c \):

   \[
   c = 12 - 7 = 5
   \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

   Now, we will use Equation 1 to express \( C \) in terms of \( S \):
   \[
   C = 20 - S
   \]

   Substitute this expression for \( C \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(20 - S) + 4S = 60
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( S \):
   \[
   40 - 2S + 4S = 60
   \]
   \[
   40 + 2S = 60
   \]
   \[
   2S = 60 - 40
   \]
   \[
   2S = 20
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = 10
   \]

   Therefore, the number of sheep \( S \) is 10.

The problem in English is as follows:

The total cost for fencing around a square park was 224 taka. How much does it cost to fence each side of the park?

## Solution:

1. **Understand the shape and structure of the problem:**
   - We are given a square park. A square has four equal sides.
   - The total cost of fencing all four sides is 224 taka.

2. **Determine the cost for each side:**
   - Since the park is square-shaped, each side of the square uses the same amount of fencing, and thus the same cost is incurred for each side.
   - We need to find out the cost to fence just one side of the park.

3. **Calculate the cost per side:**
   - We have a total cost of fencing all four sides: 224 taka.
   - Since there are four equal sides, we divide the total cost by 4 to find out the cost of fencing each side.

   \[
   \text{Cost per side} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sides}} = \frac{224}{4} = 56
   \]

   So, the cost to fence each side of the park is 56 taka.

Parker has a job that pays him 63 taka every day, and he works every day. Calculate the amount of money earned by Parker in 6 weeks.

## Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Parker earns in total over a period of 6 weeks.

### Step 1: Determine the number of days Parker works in 6 weeks.

- There are 7 days in a week.
- Parker works every day, so for 6 weeks, the total number of days Parker works is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total days} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ days} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for 6 weeks.

- Parker earns 63 taka per day.
- We need to find out how much Parker earns in 42 days.

The total earnings are calculated by multiplying the daily earnings by the total number of days worked:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 63 \times 42 \]

Now, let's calculate this step by step:

\[
63 \times 42 = 63 \times (40 + 2) = (63 \times 40) + (63 \times 2)
\]

- First, calculate \(63 \times 40\):
  \[
  63 \times 40 = 2520
  \]

- Now, calculate \(63 \times 2\):
  \[
  63 \times 2 = 126
  \]

- Add both results to get the total earnings:
  \[
  2520 + 126 = 2646
  \]

Therefore, the total earnings by Parker in 6 weeks is 2646 taka.

""What is the probability that Jisan's birthday falls on the 33rd of May?""

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the nature of dates and understand the concept of probability in this context.

1. **Understanding the Calendar:**
   - The month of May has 31 days, from May 1st to May 31st.
   - Therefore, a date such as the 33rd of May does not exist in the Gregorian calendar.

2. **Defining the Probability:**
   - Probability is typically calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Since the date ""33rd of May"" is not a valid date, it means there are no favorable outcomes where Jisan's birthday can fall on this date.

3. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - Total possible outcomes: All possible dates a birthday can fall on within a year. If we disregard the specific year limitations (e.g., leap years), the most commonly used calendar format would be 365 possible days.
   - Favorable outcomes: 0, because the 33rd of May does not exist.

Using the probability formula:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \frac{0}{365} = 0 \]

**Conclusion:**

Since 33rd of May is not a valid date, the probability of Jisan's birthday being on this date is zero.

## Solution:
To find out Rafiq's monetary loss, we will break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the cost price per egg:**
   - Rafiq bought eggs at the rate of 144 Taka per dozen.
   - One dozen equals 12 eggs.
   - Therefore, the cost price per egg is calculated as follows:

     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen eggs:**
   - Half a dozen equals 6 eggs.
   - The total cost for half a dozen eggs is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for half a dozen eggs} = 6 \text{ eggs} \times 12 \text{ Taka per egg} = 72 \text{ Taka}

In English, it translates to: ""What is the probability that Jisan's birthday is on February 30th?""

## Detailed Solution:
1. **Understanding the Calendar Context**:
   - February is the second month of the Gregorian calendar.
   - Typically, February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year.

2. **Definition of Leap Year**:
   - A leap year occurs every 4 years to help synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, or the length of time it takes the Earth to complete its orbit around the Sun, which is approximately 365.25 days.
   - Therefore, February has 29 days only in a leap year.

3. **Days in February**:
   - In a common year: 28 days (February 1 to February 28).
   - In a leap year: 29 days (February 1 to February 29).

4. **Possibility of February 30th**:
   - The date ""February 30th"" does not exist in the Gregorian calendar because February never has 30 days, regardless of whether it is a common year or a leap year.

Asif's farm has a total of 460 animal legs. How many cows are there on his farm?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we'll start by considering the types of animals that are typically found on a farm:

1. **Cows**: Usually, cows are the main four-legged animals on a farm.

Now, given that a cow has 4 legs, the problem can be approached by determining how many such four-legged animals contribute to the total of 460 legs.

### Steps:

1. **Identify the number of legs per cow**:  
   A cow has 4 legs.

2. **Establish the equation**:  
   Let \( c \) represent the number of cows. Since each cow has 4 legs, the equation to represent the total number of legs is:

   - 1 taka is equivalent to 100 paisa.
   - Therefore, 5 taka is equivalent to \(5 \times 100 = 500\) paisa.

2. **Total Money Elizabeth Has:**
   - Elizabeth initially has 5 taka which is 500 paisa.

Roman sleeps 7 hours every day. If today he wakes up at 9 AM, then at what time did he go to sleep?

### Solution:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Roman's sleep duration is 7 hours every day.
   - He wakes up today at 9 AM.
   - We need to find out what time he went to sleep.

2. **Reasoning Process:**
   - If Roman wakes up at 9 AM after sleeping for 7 hours, we need to count 7 hours backwards from 9 AM to determine his bedtime.
   - Starting from 9 AM, subtracting 1 hour takes us to 8 AM.
   - Another hour back takes us to 7 AM.
   - Continuing this, subtracting each hour progressively, we go through 6 AM, 5 AM, 4 AM, 3 AM, and finally reach 2 AM.

3. **Calculation:**
   - 9 AM - 1 hour = 8 AM
   - 8 AM - 1 hour = 7 AM
   - 7 AM - 1 hour = 6 AM
   - 6 AM - 1 hour = 5 AM
   - 5 AM - 1 hour = 4 AM
   - 4 AM - 1 hour = 3 AM
   - 3 AM - 1 hour = 2 AM

   Thus, it continues consistently backward to reach from 9 AM back to 2 AM.

In a game of chess, Ariana has lost 3 pieces and Samantha has lost 9 pieces. How many pieces are left on the chessboard?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial number of pieces in a chess game and how losing these pieces affects the total number on the board.

1. **Understanding Initial Setup:**
   - In a standard game of chess, each player starts with a total of 16 pieces. This includes:
     - 1 King
     - 1 Queen
     - 2 Rooks
     - 2 Knights
     - 2 Bishops
     - 8 Pawns

2. **Calculating Total Initial Pieces:**
   - Since both players have 16 pieces each, the total number of pieces on the chessboard at the start of the game is:
     \[
     16 \text{ (Ariana's pieces)} + 16 \text{ (Samantha's pieces)} = 32 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Determining Pieces Lost:**
   - According to the problem, Ariana has lost 3 pieces and Samantha has lost 9 pieces. Therefore, the total number of lost pieces is:
     \[
     3 + 9 = 12 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Calculating Remaining Pieces:**
   - To find the number of pieces currently left on the board, we subtract the lost pieces from the initial total:
     \[
     32 \text{ initial pieces} - 12 \text{ lost pieces} = 20 \text{ remaining pieces}

## Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days it will take Sofia to save 2 rupees if she saves 10 paisa every day.

1. **Understanding the Currency Units:**
   - 1 Rupee = 100 Paisa

2. **Total Savings Goal:**
   - Sophia's goal is to save 2 Rupees.
   - In paisa, this is equivalent to:

Penelope has decided to save 24 Taka every day for the entire year. Calculate how much money Penelope will have saved by the end of the year.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Penelope saves in a year by saving a fixed amount every day. We'll use the following steps:

1. **Determine the daily savings amount:**
   Penelope saves 24 Taka each day.

2. **Determine the number of days in a year:**
   A typical year has 365 days. However, if it's a leap year, it would have 366 days. Since the problem does not specify whether it is a leap year, we will assume it is a non-leap year with 365 days.

3. **Calculate the total savings for 365 days:**
   - Formula: Total Savings = Daily Savings × Number of Days in a Year
   - Plug in the values: Total Savings = 24 Taka/day × 365 days

4. **Perform the multiplication to find the total savings:**

   \[
   \text{Total Savings} = 24 \times 365
   \]

5. **Break down the multiplication for clarity:**
   - Calculate: \(24 \times 365 = 24 \times (300 + 60 + 5)\)
   - Apply distributive property:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     24 \times 300 & = 7200, \\
     24 \times 60 & = 1440, \\
     24 \times 5 & = 120.
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - Add these products together:
     \[
     7200 + 1440 + 120 = 8760.
     \]

6. **Calculate the total savings in case of a leap year (optional):**
   - If considering a leap year with 366 days:
   - Total Savings in a leap year = 24 Taka/day × 366 days
   - Repeat similar breakdown: 
     \[
     24 \times 366 = (24 \times 360) + (24 \times 6) = 8640 + 144 = 8784.
     \]

Since we assumed it is a non-leap year, the final result based on 365 days is:

   Ava decides to go to a nearby animal farm where there are a total of 9 animals. She is standing in line at the entrance, and from the gate, she can see the feet of the farm animals and counts a total of 26 feet. She already knows that there are only chickens and buffaloes in this farm. From this information, determine the number of buffaloes.

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we must first understand the typical number of legs for each animal in question:
   - Chickens have 2 legs each.
   - Buffaloes have 4 legs each.

   Let's denote:
   - The number of chickens as \( C \).
   - The number of buffaloes as \( B \).

   Based on the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
   - The total number of animals is 9: 
     \[
     C + B = 9
     \]

   - The total number of legs counted is 26:
     \[
     2C + 4B = 26
     \]

   Now, we'll solve these two equations simultaneously.

   From the first equation:
   \[
   C = 9 - B
   \]

   Substitute \( C = 9 - B \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2(9 - B) + 4B = 26
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( B \):
   - Expand the equation:
     \[
     18 - 2B + 4B = 26
     \]

   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     18 + 2B = 26
     \]

   - Subtract 18 from both sides:
     \[
     2B = 8
     \]

   - Divide by 2 to solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 4
     \]

   The problem states that the total cost of fencing all four sides of the park is 172 Taka.

3. **Per Side Cost Calculation:**  
   Since all four sides of a square are equal in length, the cost of fencing each side will be the same.  
   If the total cost to fence four sides is 172 Taka, then the cost to fence one side is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of sides.

   \[
   \text{Cost per side} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sides}} = \frac{172}{4}
   \]

4. **Division to Find Cost Per Side:**  
   Calculate the actual cost for one side.

   \[
   \frac{172}{4} = 43
   \]

5. **Verification:**  
   To ensure the calculation is correct, multiply the cost per side by the number of sides and check if it equals the total cost.  
   \[
   43 \times 4 = 172
   \]  
   Since the multiplication matches the given total cost, the calculation is verified.

6. **Conclusion:**  
   Therefore, the cost to fence each side of the square park is 43 Taka.

257,"একটি গাড়ি পার্কিং লটে, পেনেলোপ লক্ষ্য করেছেন যে ৪৮টি গাড়ির চাকা রয়েছে। পার্কিং লটে গাড়ির সংখ্যা কতটি?",১২,"## Translation of the Problem:
In a parking lot, Penelope has observed that there are 48 wheels of cars. What is the number of cars in the parking lot?

## Detailed Solution:
To find the number of cars in the parking lot, we will use the information given about the wheels.

1. **Understand the relationship between cars and wheels:**
   - Generally, a standard car has 4 wheels.

2. **Total number of wheels given:**
   - The problem states that there are 48 wheels in total in the parking lot.

3. **Setting up the equation:**
   - Let's assume the number of cars in the parking lot is \( x \).
   - Since each car has 4 wheels, the total number of wheels contributed by \( x \) cars is \( 4x \).

4. **Equation based on the given information:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of wheels is 48. Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     4x = 48
     \]

5. **Solving the equation:**
   - To find the value of \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{48}{4} = 12
     \]

6. **Interpretation of the result:**
   - The value of \( x \) we found is 12, which means there are 12 cars in the parking lot.

7. **Verification:**
   - If there are 12 cars, then the total number of wheels should be \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \), which matches the given condition. Therefore, the calculations are correct.

**Answer: 12**"
