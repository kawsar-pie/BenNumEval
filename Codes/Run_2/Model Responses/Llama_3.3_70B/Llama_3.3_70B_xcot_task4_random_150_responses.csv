The problem states that a movie theater charges 7.50 dollars for adults and 4.50 dollars for children. The total receipt for a movie show was 540 dollars. If 80 tickets were sold, we need to find out how many adult tickets were sold.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's define A as the number of adult tickets sold and C as the number of child tickets sold. We know that A + C = 80 (since 80 tickets were sold in total).

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the total revenue.
The total revenue from adult tickets is 7.50A and from child tickets is 4.50C. The total revenue is given as 540 dollars. So, we can set up the equation: 7.50A + 4.50C = 540.

## Step 4: Use the information from Step 2 to express C in terms of A.
From A + C = 80, we can express C as C = 80 - A.

## Step 5: Substitute the expression for C from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3.
Substituting C = 80 - A into the equation 7.50A + 4.50C = 540 gives us 7.50A + 4.50(80 - A) = 540.

## Step 6: Solve the equation for A.
Expanding the equation gives 7.50A + 360 - 4.50A = 540. Simplifying it, we get 3A + 360 = 540. Subtracting 360 from both sides gives 3A = 180. Dividing both sides by 3 gives A = 60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"

The problem states that Rayhan has 390 rupees more than Sita. Sita has 470 rupees less than Shimul. Shimul has 890 rupees. We need to find out how much money Sita has.

## Step 2: Determine the amount of money Sita has in relation to Shimul.
Since Sita has 470 rupees less than Shimul, and Shimul has 890 rupees, we can calculate Sita's amount by subtracting 470 from Shimul's amount. Sita's amount = Shimul's amount - 470.

## Step 3: Calculate Sita's amount using the information from step 2.
Sita's amount = 890 - 470 = 420 rupees.

## Step 4: Confirm that the calculation aligns with the information about Rayhan's amount in relation to Sita's.
Given that Rayhan has 390 rupees more than Sita, if we add 390 to Sita's calculated amount, we should be able to verify the relationship between Rayhan and Sita's amounts. However, since the question only asks for Sita's amount, this step is more about ensuring the consistency of the information provided.

The final answer is: **420**"

The problem states that a factory in Bakultala had an income of 75,212,000 taka last year. This year, the income increased by 32,503,325 taka. We need to calculate the total income for the two years.

## Step 2: Calculate the total income for the two years.
To find the total income for the two years, we need to add the income from last year to the income from this year. total_income = last_year_income + this_year_income.

## Step 3: Add the income from last year and this year.
last_year_income = 75,212,000 taka, this_year_income = 32,503,325 taka + 75,212,000 taka (since the problem states ""আরও"" which implies additional income). However, the correct interpretation seems to be that the additional income is for this year, so we should directly add the two figures given for the two years: total_income = 75,212,000 + 32,503,325.

## Step 4: Perform the addition.
Total income = 75,212,000 + 32,503,325 = 107,715,325.

The problem states that at a fair, 12 generators are run daily for 6 hours, and the stored oil is consumed in 7 days. If the generators are run daily for 4 hours, then the stored oil will last for 9 days for a certain number of generators.

## Step 2: Determine the relationship between the number of generators, hours of operation, and days of oil consumption.
The amount of oil consumed is directly proportional to the number of generators and the hours they are operated, and inversely proportional to the days the oil lasts. This relationship can be represented as: (number of generators) * (hours of operation) * (days of operation) = constant.

## Step 3: Use the given information to establish the equation based on the relationship identified in Step 2.
From the given information, we have two scenarios:
1. 12 generators * 6 hours/day * 7 days = constant
2. x generators * 4 hours/day * 9 days = constant
Since both scenarios equal the same constant, we can set them equal to each other to find the value of x.

## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the information from Step 3 and solve for x.
The equation based on the given scenarios is:
12 * 6 * 7 = x * 4 * 9
Simplifying the equation:
504 = 36x
Dividing both sides by 36 to solve for x:
x = 504 / 36
x = 14

The problem states that a 55-meter long bamboo has 11 meters submerged in mud and water. We need to find the percentage of the bamboo that is above the mud and water.

## Step 2: Calculate the length of the bamboo above the mud and water
To find the length of the bamboo above the mud and water, we subtract the length submerged (11 meters) from the total length of the bamboo (55 meters). So, the length above the mud and water is 55 - 11 = 44 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the bamboo above the mud and water
To find the percentage of the bamboo that is above the mud and water, we use the formula: (length above / total length) * 100. Plugging in the values, we get (44 / 55) * 100.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation
(44 / 55) * 100 = 0.8 * 100 = 80.

The problem states that Sajjad Sahib had 24,000 rupees. He donated 5/12 of this amount to an orphanage and 3/8 of it to an educational institution. We need to find out how much money is left with him.

## Step 2: Calculate the amount donated to the orphanage.
To find the amount donated to the orphanage, we multiply the total amount by 5/12. So, the amount donated to the orphanage = 24,000 * (5/12) = 10,000 rupees.

## Step 3: Calculate the amount donated to the educational institution.
To find the amount donated to the educational institution, we multiply the total amount by 3/8. So, the amount donated to the educational institution = 24,000 * (3/8) = 9,000 rupees.

## Step 4: Calculate the total amount donated.
The total amount donated = amount donated to the orphanage + amount donated to the educational institution = 10,000 + 9,000 = 19,000 rupees.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of money left with Sajjad Sahib.
The amount of money left with Sajjad Sahib = total amount - total amount donated = 24,000 - 19,000 = 5,000 rupees.

The problem states that the perimeter of a rectangular room is equal to the perimeter of a square room. The length of the rectangular room is three times its width. The total cost to carpet the floor of the rectangular room at a rate of 75 taka per square meter is 11025 taka. We need to find the length of the rectangular room in meters.

## Step 2: Define variables for the dimensions of the rooms
Let's denote the side length of the square room as 's', the length of the rectangular room as '3w' (since it's three times the width), and the width of the rectangular room as 'w'.

## Step 3: Express the perimeters of both rooms
The perimeter of the square room is 4s, and the perimeter of the rectangular room is 2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w. Since they are equal, we have 4s = 8w.

## Step 4: Solve for 's' in terms of 'w'
From the equation 4s = 8w, we find s = 2w.

## Step 5: Calculate the area of the rectangular room
The area of the rectangular room, which needs to be carpeted, is given by length times width: 3w * w = 3w^2.

## Step 6: Use the cost to find the area of the rectangular room
The cost to carpet the room is 11025 taka at a rate of 75 taka per square meter. So, the area of the room is 11025 / 75 = 147 square meters.

## Step 7: Equate the area from step 5 to the area from step 6
3w^2 = 147.

## Step 8: Solve for 'w'
Divide both sides by 3: w^2 = 49. Therefore, w = 7.

## Step 9: Find the length of the rectangular room
Since the length is three times the width (3w), the length is 3 * 7 = 21 meters.

The problem states that Yadunath Vidya Mandir school's sixth-grade students have received saplings from the panchayat to be planted in the school garden. It has been calculated that when the saplings are planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30, there are an equal number of saplings in each row. We need to find the minimum number of saplings sent by the panchayat.

## Step 2: Identify the key requirement for the number of saplings.
To have an equal number of saplings in each row when planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30, the total number of saplings must be divisible by 20, 24, and 30 without any remainder.

## Step 3: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 24, and 30.
To find the minimum number of saplings that can be evenly distributed in rows of 20, 24, or 30, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. The prime factorizations are: 20 = 2^2 * 5, 24 = 2^3 * 3, and 30 = 2 * 3 * 5.

## Step 4: Calculate the LCM using the prime factorizations.
The LCM is calculated by taking the highest powers of all prime numbers from the factorizations: LCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120.

## Step 5: Conclude the minimum number of saplings required.
The LCM of 20, 24, and 30 is 120, which means that the minimum number of saplings the panchayat must have sent is 120, as this is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by 20, 24, and 30.

The problem states that there are three ribbons of different colors and lengths: a yellow ribbon of 22 meters, a green ribbon of 24.75 meters, and an orange ribbon of 16.50 meters. The goal is to find the largest possible length of ribbon that can be cut from each of the three ribbons such that the same number of pieces of equal length can be obtained from each ribbon without wasting any part of the ribbons.

## Step 2: Determine the common factors or divisors for the lengths of the three ribbons to find the possible lengths of the pieces that can be cut.
To find the largest possible length of each piece, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of the three ribbons. The GCD will give us the longest length that can divide each of the ribbon lengths evenly.

## Step 3: Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of the three ribbons.
First, we need to find the prime factors of each length:
- Yellow ribbon: 22 = 2 * 11
- Green ribbon: 24.75 = 24 3/4 = (99/4) = 3 * 3 * 11 / 2^2
- Orange ribbon: 16.50 = 16 1/2 = (33/2) = 3 * 11 / 2

Then, identify the common factors among them which are 11 for all, considering the fractions and their implications on common divisors.

## Step 4: Calculate the GCD considering the decimal parts and fractions.
Since 24.75 and 16.50 have fractional parts, we look for a common factor that can be applied across all lengths including these fractions. Given that 11 is a common prime factor, but to account for the fractions, we consider the denominators (4 for 24.75 and 2 for 16.50), implying a division by 2 or 4. Thus, the practical approach is to find a divisor that fits all measurements without remainder, which requires considering the least common multiple of the denominators (4 in this case) and how it affects the common factor among the ribbons.

## Step 5: Find the GCD that fits all measurements without remainder.
Given the constraints of fractional lengths and the need for an integer GCD, we simplify our approach to finding the largest whole"

The problem states that 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters and 1 acre is equal to 4840 square yards. We need to find out how many square meters are in 1 acre.

## Step 2: Understand the conversion factors given
We have two conversion factors: 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters and 1 acre = 4840 square yards. To find the number of square meters in 1 acre, we need to convert square yards to square meters.

## Step 3: Convert square yards to square meters
First, we need to know that 1 yard = 3 feet and 1 foot = 12 inches. So, 1 yard = 3 * 12 = 36 inches. Since 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters, 1 yard = 36 * 2.54 = 91.44 centimeters. Therefore, 1 square yard = (91.44 centimeters)^2 = 8353.46 square centimeters or 8.35346 square meters (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters).

## Step 4: Calculate the number of square meters in 1 acre
Given that 1 acre = 4840 square yards, we can now convert this to square meters by multiplying the number of square yards in an acre by the number of square meters in a square yard. So, 1 acre = 4840 * 8.35346 square meters.

## Step 5: Perform the final calculation
Calculate the number of square meters in 1 acre: 4840 * 8.35346 = 4046.85624 square meters.

The problem states that in a park, there are two trees: a banyan tree and a pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. Currently, the age of the pine tree is 1432 years. We need to find the current sum of their ages.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the ages of the trees 150 years ago.
Let's denote the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago as B and the age of the pine tree 150 years ago as P.

## Step 3: Express the given information in equations.
From the problem, we have the equation: B + P = 2961.

## Step 4: Calculate the current age of the pine tree and express it in terms of its age 150 years ago.
The current age of the pine tree is given as 1432 years. So, we can write an equation for the pine tree's age: P + 150 = 1432.

## Step 5: Solve for P, the age of the pine tree 150 years ago.
Subtract 150 from both sides of the equation P + 150 = 1432 to find P. P = 1432 - 150 = 1282.

## Step 6: Find the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago.
Substitute the value of P into the equation B + P = 2961 to find B. B + 1282 = 2961. Subtract 1282 from both sides: B = 2961 - 1282 = 1679.

The problem states that a fish seller buys Hilsa fish at 1600 Taka per piece and sells them at 350 Taka per piece. We need to find the percentage of profit or loss incurred by the seller.

## Step 2: Determine the cost price (CP) and selling price (SP) per fish.
The cost price (CP) per fish is 1600 Taka, and the selling price (SP) per fish is 350 Taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the loss per fish since the selling price is less than the cost price.
Loss per fish = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP) = 1600 - 350 = 1250 Taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the percentage of loss.
To find the percentage of loss, we use the formula: (Loss / Cost Price) * 100.
Percentage of loss = (1250 / 1600) * 100.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation for the percentage of loss.
Percentage of loss = (1250 / 1600) * 100 = 0.78125 * 100 = 78.125%.

## Step 6: Round the percentage of loss to a whole number if necessary.
Since the problem doesn't specify rounding, we'll keep the percentage as calculated.

The problem describes a rectangular garden with a length of 80 meters and a width of 60 meters. Inside this garden, there is a path that is 4 meters wide and surrounds the garden on all sides. We need to find the cost of constructing this path at a rate of 7.25 rupees per square meter.

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the garden including the path.
To find the area of the garden including the path, we first need to calculate the outer dimensions of the garden and the path. The length of the garden including the path is 80 + 2*4 = 88 meters, and the width is 60 + 2*4 = 68 meters. The area of the garden including the path is 88 * 68 = 5984 square meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the garden excluding the path.
The area of the garden itself, excluding the path, is 80 * 60 = 4800 square meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the path.
To find the area of the path, we subtract the area of the garden excluding the path from the area of the garden including the path. So, the area of the path is 5984 - 4800 = 1184 square meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the cost of constructing the path.
Given that the cost of constructing the path is 7.25 rupees per square meter, we can find the total cost by multiplying the area of the path by the cost per square meter. The cost is 1184 * 7.25 = 8578 rupees.

The problem states that there is a rectangular field with a length of 48 meters and a width of 32 meters 80 centimeters. Around this field, there is a road that is 3 meters wide on all sides. We need to find the area of this road.

## Step 2: Convert the width of the field into meters for uniformity.
First, we convert 32 meters 80 centimeters into just meters. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 80 centimeters = 0.8 meters. Therefore, the width of the field is 32 + 0.8 = 32.8 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the total area of the field including the road.
To find the area of the road, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the field including the road. The new length will be 48 + 3 + 3 = 54 meters (since the road adds 3 meters on each side), and the new width will be 32.8 + 3 + 3 = 38.8 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the field including the road.
The area of the field including the road is the product of its length and width, so it is 54 * 38.8 = 2095.2 square meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the area of the field itself.
The area of the field itself (without the road) is the product of its original length and width, so it is 48 * 32.8 = 1574.4 square meters.

## Step 6: Find the area of the road by subtracting the area of the field from the total area.
The area of the road is the difference between the total area (field plus road) and the area of the field itself, so it is 2095.2 - 1574.4 = 520.8 square meters.

The problem states: ""At the rate of interest at which Rs. 6500 becomes Rs. 8840 in 4 years, what amount will become Rs. 10200 in 4 years at the same rate of interest?""

## Step 2: Identify the given values and the unknown value.
Given values: Principal amount (P1) = Rs. 6500, Amount after 4 years (A1) = Rs. 8840, Time (t) = 4 years, and the new amount after 4 years (A2) = Rs. 10200. The unknown value is the new principal amount (P2).

## Step 3: Calculate the interest earned on the first principal amount.
Interest (I1) = A1 - P1 = 8840 - 6500 = Rs. 2340.

## Step 4: Determine the rate of interest.
Since we know the interest earned over 4 years, we can use the simple interest formula: I = (P * r * t) / 100, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time in years. However, because the problem does not directly ask for the rate of interest but rather for a new principal amount based on the same rate, we can bypass explicitly calculating the rate of interest and instead use the proportionality between the two scenarios.

## Step 5: Set up a proportion to find the new principal amount.
Since the rate of interest and the time period are the same for both scenarios, the interest earned is directly proportional to the principal amount. We can set up a proportion based on the amounts after 4 years: (P1 / A1) = (P2 / A2), but since we're looking for P2 and we know the interest is proportional, we can directly use the relation of the amounts after interest to find P2. Given that A1 = P1 + I1 and A2 = P2 + I2, and knowing I1 and the ratio of A1 to A2, we find I2 by proportion and then solve for P2.

## Step 6: Calculate the new principal amount (P2).
First, find the ratio of the final amounts: A2 / A1 = 10200 / 8840. This ratio also applies to the principal amounts because the interest rate and time are"

The problem states that Raju and Rony together have 690 lychees. Rony has 86 fewer lychees than Raju. We need to find out how many lychees Raju has.

## Step 2: Define the variables
Let's define the number of lychees Raju has as R and the number of lychees Rony has as Y.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information
From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of lychees they have together is 690, so R + Y = 690.
2. Rony has 86 fewer lychees than Raju, so Y = R - 86.

## Step 4: Substitute the second equation into the first to solve for R
Substituting Y = R - 86 into the equation R + Y = 690 gives us R + (R - 86) = 690.

## Step 5: Solve the equation for R
Simplifying the equation R + R - 86 = 690, we get 2R - 86 = 690. Adding 86 to both sides gives 2R = 776. Dividing both sides by 2 gives R = 388.

The problem states that 15 vans can pull 75 quintals of vegetables in 40 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take for 20 vans to pull 100 quintals of vegetables.

## Step 2: Determine the rate at which the vans can pull vegetables.
First, let's calculate the rate at which 15 vans can pull vegetables. Since they can pull 75 quintals in 40 minutes, their combined rate is 75 quintals / 40 minutes = 1.875 quintals per minute for 15 vans.

## Step 3: Calculate the rate per van.
To find out the rate per van, we divide the combined rate by the number of vans. So, 1.875 quintals per minute / 15 vans = 0.125 quintals per minute per van.

## Step 4: Calculate the combined rate of 20 vans.
Now, we calculate the combined rate of 20 vans. Since one van can pull 0.125 quintals per minute, 20 vans can pull 20 * 0.125 = 2.5 quintals per minute.

## Step 5: Calculate the time needed for 20 vans to pull 100 quintals of vegetables.
To find out how long it will take for 20 vans to pull 100 quintals, we divide the total amount of vegetables by the combined rate of the vans. So, 100 quintals / 2.5 quintals per minute = 40 minutes.

## Step 4: Formulate the equation based on the past ratio
According to the given information, the ratio of their ages 10 years ago was 4:1. This can be expressed as (F - 10) / (S - 10) = 4 / 1.

## Step 5: Express the future ages of the father and son
After 10 years, the father's age will be F + 10 and the son's age will be S + 10.

## Step 6: Formulate the equation based on the future ratio
The ratio of their ages after 10 years will be 2:1. This can be expressed as (F + 10) / (S + 10) = 2 / 1.

## Step 7: Solve the system of equations
From step 4, we have F - 10 = 4(S - 10), which simplifies to F - 10 = 4S - 40, and further simplifies to F = 4S - 30.

From step 6, we have F + 10 = 2(S + 10), which simplifies to F + 10 = 2S + 20, and further simplifies to F = 2S + 10.

## Step 8: Equate the expressions for F from step 7
Setting the two expressions for F equal to each other gives us 4S - 30 = 2S + 10.

## Step 9: Solve for S
Solving the equation 4S - 30 = 2S + 10 for S, we get 4S - 2S = 10 + 30, which simplifies to 2S = 40, and thus S = 20.

The problem states that a 2-meter long stick has 75 cm of its length painted red, and the remaining length is painted white. We need to find the ratio of the length painted red to the length painted white.

## Step 2: Convert the length of the stick to centimeters
Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, a 2-meter long stick is equivalent to 2 * 100 = 200 cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the length of the stick painted white
The length painted white can be found by subtracting the length painted red (75 cm) from the total length of the stick (200 cm). So, the length painted white is 200 - 75 = 125 cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of red to white length
To find the ratio of the length painted red to the length painted white, we divide the length painted red (75 cm) by the length painted white (125 cm). This gives us 75 / 125.

## Step 5: Simplify the ratio
The ratio 75 / 125 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25. Simplifying yields 3 / 5.

The problem states: ""Any one smallest square number has a factor of 17. The number is _____.""

## Step 2: Understand the concept of a square number and its factors.
A square number is the result of multiplying a number by itself. For example, 4 is a square number because it is 2 * 2. The factors of a number are the numbers that can be multiplied together to get that number.

## Step 3: Recognize the importance of 17 being a factor.
Since 17 is a prime number, and it is a factor of the smallest square number we are looking for, this square number must include 17 as one of its factors. The smallest possible square that includes 17 as a factor would be 17 * 17, because 17 itself cannot be a factor of any smaller square number.

## Step 4: Calculate the smallest square number with 17 as a factor.
The calculation for the smallest square number with 17 as a factor is 17 * 17.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation.
17 * 17 = 289.

The problem states that a rectangular room has a perimeter equal to that of a square room. The length of the rectangular room is three times its width. The floor of the room is to be covered with carpet, and it costs 75 rupees per square meter. The total cost for covering the floor is 11,025 rupees. We are asked to find out how many 40 cm by 40 cm square tiles are needed to cover the floor of the square room.

## Step 2: Determine the area of the rectangular room based on the cost of carpeting.
First, we calculate the total area of the rectangular room that was carpeted. Given that the cost per square meter is 75 rupees and the total cost is 11,025 rupees, we can find the area by dividing the total cost by the cost per square meter. area = total_cost / cost_per_square_meter = 11025 / 75 = 147 square meters.

## Step 3: Express the relationship between the length and width of the rectangular room.
Let's denote the width of the rectangular room as W and the length as 3W, since the length is three times the width.

## Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular room and set it equal to the perimeter of the square room.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(length + width), which in this case is P = 2(3W + W) = 2(4W) = 8W. The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length. Since the perimeters are equal, we have 8W = 4s, where s is the side length of the square.

## Step 5: Find the dimensions of the rectangular room using its area.
The area of the rectangle (A = length * width) is 147 square meters. Substituting the length as 3W, we get 3W * W = 147, which simplifies to 3W^2 = 147. Solving for W gives W^2 = 49, hence W = 7 meters. Therefore, the length is 3W = 3 * 7 = 21 meters.

## Step 6: Determine the side length of the square room.
Since the perimeter of the rectangular room is equal to the perimeter of the square room, and we know the perimeter of the rectangular room is 8"

The problem states that the sum of the ages of a mother and her son is 60 years. It also mentions that the mother's age is three times the age of the son. We need to find the mother's age.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the son's age as S and the mother's age as M.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be turned into equations:
1. The sum of the ages of the mother and the son is 60 years: M + S = 60.
2. The mother's age is three times the age of the son: M = 3S.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S.
Substituting M = 3S into M + S = 60 gives us 3S + S = 60.
This simplifies to 4S = 60.

## Step 5: Find the value of S.
Divide both sides of the equation 4S = 60 by 4 to solve for S: S = 60 / 4 = 15.

## Step 6: Find the value of M using the value of S.
Since M = 3S, we substitute S = 15 into this equation to find M: M = 3 * 15 = 45.

## Step 7: Conclude with the final numerical answer.
The mother's age is 45 years.

The problem states that it takes 1 deciliter (DSL) of paint to paint 3/4 of a square meter of a board. We need to find out how many square meters can be painted with 4 deciliters (DSL) of paint.

## Step 2: Determine the rate at which the paint covers the board.
First, we establish the ratio of paint to area covered. Given that 1 deciliter of paint covers 3/4 of a square meter, this means the paint covers 0.75 square meters per deciliter.

## Step 3: Calculate the area that can be covered by 4 deciliters of paint.
To find out how many square meters can be painted with 4 deciliters of paint, we multiply the area covered by 1 deciliter by 4. So, 0.75 square meters/deciliter * 4 deciliters = 3 square meters.

The problem states that in our family, a total of 4750 rupees is spent on food and 5900 rupees on other expenses. If the food expense is increased by 10% and the other expenses are decreased by 16%, then the total monthly expense will decrease by a certain amount.

## Step 2: Calculate the new food expense after a 10% increase.
To find the new food expense, we need to calculate 10% of the original food expense and add it to the original expense. The original food expense is 4750 rupees. 10% of 4750 is 0.10 * 4750 = 475 rupees. So, the new food expense will be 4750 + 475 = 5225 rupees.

## Step 3: Calculate the new other expense after a 16% decrease.
To find the new other expense, we need to calculate 16% of the original other expense and subtract it from the original expense. The original other expense is 5900 rupees. 16% of 5900 is 0.16 * 5900 = 944 rupees. So, the new other expense will be 5900 - 944 = 4956 rupees.

## Step 4: Calculate the total new monthly expense.
The total new monthly expense is the sum of the new food expense and the new other expense. Total new monthly expense = 5225 + 4956 = 10181 rupees.

## Step 5: Calculate the original total monthly expense.
The original total monthly expense is the sum of the original food expense and the original other expense. Original total monthly expense = 4750 + 5900 = 10650 rupees.

## Step 6: Calculate the decrease in the total monthly expense.
To find the decrease in the total monthly expense, we subtract the new total monthly expense from the original total monthly expense. Decrease = Original total monthly expense - Total new monthly expense = 10650 - 10181 = 469 rupees.

The problem states that Shyamal Chakma borrowed 4500 taka from a bank with an annual interest rate of 8% on the principal amount. We need to calculate the total amount he has to pay after 10 years.

## Step 2: Calculate the interest accrued over 10 years
To find the total amount to be paid, we first need to calculate the interest accrued over 10 years. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

## Step 3: Apply the values to the simple interest formula
Given that the principal amount P = 4500 taka, the annual interest rate r = 8% or 0.08, and the time period t = 10 years, we can calculate the interest I = 4500 * 0.08 * 10.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation for interest
I = 4500 * 0.08 * 10 = 3600 taka.

## Step 5: Calculate the total amount to be paid
The total amount to be paid is the sum of the principal amount and the interest accrued. Total amount = Principal + Interest = 4500 + 3600.

Nabil bought kilograms of sandesh from a sweet shop at 250 taka per kilogram. The VAT rate is 4 percent, so we need to calculate the total amount Nabil will pay to the shopkeeper for buying the sandesh, including VAT.

## Step 2: Calculate the VAT amount per kilogram of sandesh.
To find the VAT amount per kilogram, we need to calculate 4 percent of the cost per kilogram. The cost per kilogram is 250 taka. So, the VAT per kilogram = 4% of 250 = 0.04 * 250 = 10 taka.

## Step 3: Determine the total cost per kilogram of sandesh, including VAT.
The total cost per kilogram, including VAT, is the sum of the cost per kilogram and the VAT per kilogram. So, total cost per kilogram = 250 taka (cost) + 10 taka (VAT) = 260 taka.

The problem states: ""Find the smallest natural number that when multiplied by 7 results in a perfect square number.""

## Step 2: Understand what makes a perfect square number in relation to multiplication.
A perfect square number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself. If 7 (a prime number) is multiplied by another number to get a perfect square, that other number must include enough factors of 7 to make each prime factor's exponent even, because a perfect square's prime factorization has even exponents for all its primes.

## Step 3: Determine the factor needed to make the product a perfect square.
Since 7 is a prime number, to make the product a perfect square, we need another 7 (because 7*7 = 49, which is a perfect square). Thus, the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 7, gives a perfect square is 7 itself.

We need to find the area of the remaining part of the country, excluding the forest and river basin.

## Step 2: Calculate the total area covered by the forest and the river basin.
To find the area of the remaining part, we first need to calculate the total area covered by the forest and the river basin. This can be done by adding the areas of the forest and the river basin. Total covered area = forest area + river basin area = 7,547,740 + 25,030,000.

The problem states that for a two-digit number, the sum of its digits is 10 and the difference between its digits is 4. We need to find the largest possible two-digit number that satisfies these conditions.

## Step 2: Define the digits of the two-digit number
Let's denote the tens digit as 'x' and the units digit as 'y'. Therefore, the two-digit number can be expressed as 10x + y.

## Step 3: Formulate equations based on the given conditions
From the problem, we have two conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is 10: x + y = 10
2. The difference between the digits is 4: x - y = 4

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations
To find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations simultaneously.
From the second equation (x - y = 4), we can express x as x = y + 4.
Substituting this expression for x into the first equation (x + y = 10), we get (y + 4) + y = 10, which simplifies to 2y + 4 = 10.
Solving for y, we get 2y = 6, and thus y = 3.
Substituting y = 3 back into x = y + 4, we find x = 3 + 4 = 7.

## Step 5: Determine the largest possible two-digit number
With x = 7 and y = 3, the two-digit number is 10x + y = 10*7 + 3 = 70 + 3 = 73.

## Step 2: Calculate the interest for the first scenario.
First, let's calculate the interest for the first scenario using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. Here, Principal = 500 taka, Rate = 6% or 0.06, and Time = 4 years. So, Interest = 500 * 0.06 * 4 = 120 taka.

## Step 3: Set up the equation for the second scenario.
Now, let's set up the equation for the second scenario. We have: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. Here, Interest = 120 taka (since it's the same as the first scenario), Rate = 5% or 0.05, and Time = 2 years 6 months = 2.5 years. We need to find the Principal.

## Step 4: Calculate the Principal for the second scenario.
Using the formula Interest = Principal * Rate * Time, we can rearrange it to find the Principal: Principal = Interest / (Rate * Time). Plugging in the values, we get Principal = 120 / (0.05 * 2.5) = 120 / 0.125 = 960.

## Step 2: Identify the prime factors of the given numbers
To find the smallest perfect square number that is divisible by 10, 15, 20, and 30, we first need to identify the prime factors of these numbers.
- The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5.
- The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5.
- The prime factors of 20 are 2, 2, and 5.
- The prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5.

## Step 3: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the given numbers
To ensure divisibility by all the given numbers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 15, 20, and 30.
- The LCM of 10, 15, 20, and 30 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved: 2^2, 3, and 5^1 = 2*2*3*5 = 60.

## Step 4: Find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of the LCM
Since we need a perfect square, we must ensure that each prime factor's exponent is an even number.
- The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5.
- To make each exponent even, we need an additional 3 and an additional 5 (since 2 already has an even exponent), resulting in 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2.

## Step 5: Calculate the smallest perfect square number
Now, we calculate the smallest perfect square number using the adjusted prime factors.
- The smallest perfect square number = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 4 * 9 * 25 = 900.

The problem states that when 5 is added to the numerator of a fraction, its value becomes 2, and when 1 is subtracted from the denominator, its value becomes 1.

## Step 2: Define the fraction and set up the equations based on the given conditions.
Let's denote the numerator of the fraction as 'x' and the denominator as 'y'. The original fraction is x/y. According to the problem, when 5 is added to the numerator, the fraction becomes (x+5)/y = 2. Also, when 1 is subtracted from the denominator, the fraction becomes x/(y-1) = 1.

## Step 3: Solve the first equation (x+5)/y = 2 for x in terms of y.
Multiply both sides by y to get x + 5 = 2y. Then subtract 5 from both sides to get x = 2y - 5.

## Step 4: Solve the second equation x/(y-1) = 1 for x in terms of y.
Multiply both sides by (y-1) to get x = y - 1.

## Step 5: Equate the expressions for x from step 3 and step 4 to find y.
Set 2y - 5 = y - 1. Subtract y from both sides to get y - 5 = -1. Add 5 to both sides to get y = 4.

## Step 6: Substitute the value of y back into one of the equations to find x.
Using x = y - 1 from step 4 and y = 4, we get x = 4 - 1 = 3.

## Step 7: Write down the fraction using the values of x and y.
The fraction is x/y = 3/4.

The problem states that the current population of a city is 8 million (80 lakh). The population growth rate of the city is 30 per thousand. We need to find the population of the city after 3 years.

## Step 2: Convert the population growth rate to a decimal for calculation purposes.
The growth rate is 30 per thousand, which can be converted to a decimal as 30/1000 = 0.03. This represents the annual growth rate.

## Step 3: Apply the formula for compound annual growth to calculate the population after 3 years.
The formula for compound annual growth is P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P0 is the initial population, r is the annual growth rate, and t is the number of years. In this case, P0 = 8,000,000, r = 0.03, and t = 3.

## Step 4: Plug in the values into the formula to calculate the population after 3 years.
P(3) = 8,000,000 * (1 + 0.03)^3
P(3) = 8,000,000 * (1.03)^3
P(3) = 8,000,000 * 1.092727
P(3) = 8,741,816

The problem states: ""At an annual interest rate of 8.50% compounded annually, the compound interest on 10,000 taka for 2 years is _____ taka.""

## Step 2: Identify the formula for compound interest.
The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount after time t
- P is the principal amount (initial investment)
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal)
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year
- t is the time the money is invested for in years

## Step 3: Convert the annual interest rate to decimal form.
The annual interest rate is 8.50%, which in decimal form is 0.085.

## Step 4: Plug the values into the compound interest formula.
Given that P = 10,000 taka, r = 0.085, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2 years, we can calculate the amount after 2 years.
A = 10,000(1 + 0.085/1)^(1*2)

## Step 5: Calculate the amount after 2 years.
A = 10,000(1 + 0.085)^2
A = 10,000(1.085)^2

The problem states that Abir has 10 notes of 10 rupees, 10 notes of 20 rupees, and 10 notes of 50 rupees. We need to find the minimum number of notes Abir can use to pay 200 rupees.

## Step 2: Determine the maximum amount that can be paid with the largest denomination
To minimize the number of notes, we should use the largest denomination possible. In this case, the largest denomination is 50 rupees. We can calculate how many 50-rupee notes Abir can use to get as close to 200 rupees as possible without exceeding it. 200 / 50 = 4, so Abir can use 4 notes of 50 rupees to pay 200 rupees. However, we need to check if this combination is possible and if it's the minimum.

## Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after using the largest denomination
Using 4 notes of 50 rupees amounts to 4 * 50 = 200 rupees. This exactly covers the amount Abir needs to pay, leaving no remaining amount.

## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of notes needed
Since using 4 notes of 50 rupees exactly covers the 200 rupees needed, no additional notes of smaller denominations are required. Thus, the minimum number of notes Abir needs to pay 200 rupees is 4.

The problem states that Mehbub and his team have decided to build a 371/15 km road in 33 days. They have already worked for 25 days, building 11/15 km of road per day. Now, to complete the remaining work on time, we need to find out how much road they need to build per day for the remaining days.

## Step 2: Calculate the total amount of road built in the first 25 days.
To find the total amount of road built in 25 days, we multiply the daily amount of road built (11/15 km) by the number of days (25).
Total road built in 25 days = (11/15) * 25 = 181/15 km, but to simplify, we convert the fraction to a decimal or keep it as fraction for accuracy. Since we are working with fractions, let's keep it as (11/15) * 25 = 11 * 25 / 15 = 275 / 15 km.

## Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of road to be built.
The total length of road to be built is 371/15 km. Subtracting the amount built in the first 25 days from the total gives us the remaining amount of road to be built.
Remaining road = Total road - Road built in 25 days = 371/15 - 275/15 = (371 - 275) / 15 = 96 / 15 km.

## Step 4: Determine the number of remaining days to complete the work.
The team has 33 days to complete the work and has already worked for 25 days. So, the number of remaining days is 33 - 25 = 8 days.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of road that needs to be built per day for the remaining days.
To find the daily amount of road to be built for the remaining 8 days, we divide the remaining amount of road by the number of remaining days.
Daily road for remaining days = Remaining road / Remaining days = (96 / 15) / 8 = 96 / (15 * 8) = 96 / 120 = 8 / 10 = 4 / 5 km per day.

## Step 2: Calculate Nasir Sahib's annual income.
First, we need to find out Nasir Sahib's annual income. Since his monthly salary is 27,650 Tk, we multiply this by 12 to get the annual income. Annual income = 27,650 * 12 = 331,800 Tk.

## Step 3: Determine the amount of income subject to tax.
The first 250,000 Tk of his annual income is tax-free. So, we subtract this from his total annual income to find out the amount that is subject to tax. Taxable income = Annual income - 250,000 = 331,800 - 250,000 = 81,800 Tk.

## Step 4: Calculate the income tax payable.
The tax rate for the taxable amount is 10%. To find out how much tax Nasir Sahib has to pay, we calculate 10% of his taxable income. Income tax = Taxable income * 10% = 81,800 * 0.10 = 8,180 Tk.

An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length. The perimeter of any triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. For an equilateral triangle, since all sides are equal, the perimeter is three times the length of one side.

## Step 3: Set up the equation for the perimeter
Let's denote the length of one side of the equilateral triangle as ""s"". The perimeter (P) of the equilateral triangle can be represented as P = 3s. We are given that the perimeter (P) is 14.4 cm. So, we have 14.4 = 3s.

## Step 4: Solve for the length of one side
To find the length of one side (s), we divide both sides of the equation by 3. Thus, s = 14.4 / 3.

## Step 5: Calculate the value
Calculating the value of s: s = 14.4 / 3 = 4.8.

The final answer is: **4.8**"

The problem states that a boat travels 77 kilometers in 11 hours against the current. Given that the boat's speed in still water is 9 kilometers per hour, we need to find the speed of the current.

## Step 2: Define the variables and the relationship between the boat's speed, the current's speed, and the distance traveled.
Let's denote the speed of the current as C kilometers per hour. The effective speed of the boat against the current is then (9 - C) kilometers per hour, since the boat and the current are moving in opposite directions.

## Step 3: Use the formula Distance = Speed × Time to establish an equation based on the given information.
We know that Distance = 77 kilometers and Time = 11 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation as 77 = (9 - C) × 11.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for C, the speed of the current.
To find C, we first divide both sides of the equation by 11, resulting in 7 = 9 - C. Then, we rearrange the equation to solve for C: C = 9 - 7.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of C.
C = 9 - 7 = 2.

The problem states: ""At an annual percentage rate of _____, a certain principal amount will yield an interest of 18850 in 8 years.""

## Step 2: Identify the formula for simple interest to solve the problem.
The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), and t is the time in years.

## Step 3: Recognize that the problem provides the interest (I) and the time (t) but not the principal (P) or the rate (r).
We are given I = 18850 and t = 8 years. However, we are missing the principal amount (P) and the rate (r), which are needed to solve for the rate.

## Step 4: Notice the relationship between interest, principal, and the formula for simple interest.
Since the interest earned equals the principal times the rate times the time (I = P * r * t), without the principal, we cannot directly solve for the rate using the given information.

## Step 5: Realize that the problem implies the interest equals the principal, which is a key insight to solve the problem.
Given the nature of the problem, it seems to imply that the interest earned over 8 years (18850) is equal to the principal amount, which would double the principal after 8 years under compound interest or be a special condition for simple interest.

## Step 6: Apply the formula for simple interest with the understanding from Step 5.
However, Step 5's implication doesn't directly apply to simple interest formulas without additional assumptions. Normally, for simple interest, I = PRT. If we consider the interest to be the amount that, when added to the principal, doubles it (a common misunderstanding of the problem statement), we'd look for a rate where the interest earned over the period would equal the original principal, thus doubling the principal after the interest is added.

## Step 7: Reinterpret the problem correctly based on standard financial formulas.
The correct interpretation should be that the interest earned (18850) over 8 years, when added to the principal, results in a total amount that is the principal plus the interest. The problem seems to be asking for a rate that would result in this specific interest amount over 8 years, implying we need to find the principal first or use a relationship that"

The problem states that a wholesaler makes a 20% profit and the retailer also makes a 20% profit from the sale of a product. If the retail selling price of the product is 576 rupees, we need to find the cost price for the wholesaler.

## Step 2: Determine the selling price for the retailer to find the cost price for the retailer.
Since the retailer makes a 20% profit, we can set up an equation where the selling price is 120% of the cost price for the retailer. Let's denote the cost price for the retailer as x. Therefore, the selling price (which is given as 576 rupees) is x + 20% of x, or 1.2x = 576.

## Step 3: Solve for the cost price for the retailer.
To find x, which is the cost price for the retailer, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2. So, x = 576 / 1.2 = 480 rupees.

## Step 4: Determine the cost price for the wholesaler.
The cost price for the retailer is the selling price for the wholesaler. Since the wholesaler makes a 20% profit, we need to find the cost price for the wholesaler (let's denote it as y) such that y + 20% of y equals the cost price for the retailer (480 rupees). Therefore, 1.2y = 480.

## Step 5: Solve for the cost price for the wholesaler.
To find y, which is the cost price for the wholesaler, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2. So, y = 480 / 1.2 = 400 rupees.

The problem states that an egg seller buys 5 dozen eggs at 101 rupees per dozen and 6 dozen eggs at 90 rupees per dozen. The seller then sells these eggs at a certain price per dozen, resulting in a profit of 3 rupees per dozen.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying the eggs.
To find the total cost, we calculate the cost of 5 dozen eggs at 101 rupees per dozen and the cost of 6 dozen eggs at 90 rupees per dozen.
Total cost = (5 * 101) + (6 * 90)
Total cost = 505 + 540
Total cost = 1045 rupees

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of dozens of eggs bought.
The seller buys 5 dozen and 6 dozen eggs, so the total number of dozens is:
Total dozens = 5 + 6
Total dozens = 11

## Step 4: Determine the selling price per dozen to achieve a 3 rupee profit per dozen.
Let's denote the selling price per dozen as 'x'. Since the seller wants a profit of 3 rupees per dozen, the total profit from selling 11 dozen eggs would be 11 * 3 = 33 rupees.
The total selling price for 11 dozen eggs should be the total cost plus the total profit:
Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit
Total selling price = 1045 + 33
Total selling price = 1078 rupees

## Step 5: Calculate the selling price per dozen.
The selling price per dozen can be found by dividing the total selling price by the total number of dozens:
Selling price per dozen = Total selling price / Total dozens
Selling price per dozen = 1078 / 11

## Step 6: Calculate the selling price per dozen.
Selling price per dozen = 98 rupees

The problem states that the product of two positive perfect square numbers is 1576, and the quotient (or ratio) of the two numbers is 9/7. We need to find the smaller of the two numbers.

## Step 2: Express the problem mathematically.
Let's denote the two perfect square numbers as x^2 and y^2, where x and y are integers. According to the problem, we have:
1. x^2 * y^2 = 1576
2. x^2 / y^2 = 9/7

## Step 3: Simplify the equations.
From equation (2), we can express x^2 in terms of y^2 as x^2 = (9/7)y^2.

## Step 4: Substitute x^2 from step 3 into equation (1) to find y^2.
Substituting x^2 = (9/7)y^2 into the equation x^2 * y^2 = 1576 gives us:
(9/7)y^2 * y^2 = 1576
This simplifies to:
(9/7)y^4 = 1576

## Step 5: Solve for y^4.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 7/9 to isolate y^4 gives us:
y^4 = 1576 * (7/9)

## Step 6: Calculate y^4.
y^4 = 1576 * (7/9) = 1228.222... (approximately), but since we are dealing with perfect squares, we need to find a perfect fourth power that fits this equation, recognizing that 1576 = 4*394 = 4*2*197, and it can be factored further into primes as 2^3 * 197. However, we seek integer values for x and y, so let's correctly approach the factorization and solving.

## Step 7: Correct approach to factorization and solving.
Recognize that 1576 can be factored into 4*394 or further into 2^3 * 197. Since we're dealing with squares, let's look for factors that are perfect squares. We note that 1576 = 4 * 394, and since 4 is a square (2^2), we can consider this as part of our factorization. However,"

The problem states that Mr. Ramiz deposited 5000 taka into a bank and decided not to withdraw any money from the bank for the next 6 years. The bank's annual interest rate is 10%. We need to find out how much interest Mr. Ramiz will earn after 6 years.

## Step 2: Calculate the interest earned each year.
To calculate the interest earned each year, we can use the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate. Here, the principal is 5000 taka, and the rate is 10% or 0.10. So, the interest earned in the first year is 5000 * 0.10 = 500 taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the total interest earned after 6 years using compound interest formula.
Since the interest is compounded annually, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. However, to find the total interest earned, we can also calculate the interest for each year and sum them up. Alternatively, we can apply the formula for compound interest and then subtract the principal to find the interest earned.

## Step 4: Apply the compound interest formula.
Using the compound interest formula A = P(1 + r)^n, where P = 5000, r = 0.10, and n = 6, we can calculate the total amount after 6 years. A = 5000(1 + 0.10)^6.

## Step 5: Calculate the total amount after 6 years.
A = 5000(1.10)^6 = 5000 * 1.771561 = 8857.805 taka.

## Step 6: Calculate the total interest earned.
The total interest earned is the total amount after 6 years minus the principal. Interest = A - P = 8857.805 - 5000.

## Step 7: Perform the subtraction to find the total interest.
Interest = 8857.805 - 5000 = 3857.805 taka.

The problem states that Geeta, Rita, and Mita together have 180 rupees. Geeta has 6 rupees less than Rita and 12 rupees more than Mita.

## Step 2: Define variables for each person's amount of money.
Let's define variables: G = amount of money Geeta has, R = amount of money Rita has, and M = amount of money Mita has.

## Step 3: Express the relationships between Geeta, Rita, and Mita's amounts of money in terms of equations.
Given that Geeta has 6 rupees less than Rita, we can write the equation as G = R - 6. Also, since Geeta has 12 rupees more than Mita, we can write another equation as G = M + 12.

## Step 4: Express Rita and Mita's amounts of money in terms of G.
From the equation G = R - 6, we can express R in terms of G as R = G + 6. From the equation G = M + 12, we can express M in terms of G as M = G - 12.

## Step 5: Write the equation representing the total amount of money they have together.
The total amount of money is given as 180 rupees, so we can write the equation: G + R + M = 180.

## Step 6: Substitute the expressions for R and M from step 4 into the equation from step 5.
Substituting R = G + 6 and M = G - 12 into the equation G + R + M = 180 gives us G + (G + 6) + (G - 12) = 180.

## Step 7: Simplify and solve the equation for G.
Combining like terms, we get G + G + 6 + G - 12 = 180, which simplifies to 3G - 6 = 180. Adding 6 to both sides gives 3G = 186. Dividing both sides by 3 gives G = 62.

The problem states: Find the larger number of a pair of two-digit numbers between 50 and 100 whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is 16 and whose sum is 176.

## Step 2: Understand the conditions
To solve this problem, we need to find two numbers, let's call them x and y, where 50 < x < 100 and 50 < y < 100. The GCD of x and y must be 16, and their sum must be 176.

## Step 3: Express the conditions mathematically
We have two conditions:
1. GCD(x, y) = 16
2. x + y = 176

## Step 4: Use the GCD condition to narrow down possibilities
Since the GCD of x and y is 16, both x and y must be multiples of 16. The multiples of 16 between 50 and 100 are 64 and 80, and 96.

## Step 5: Check pairs of multiples of 16 for the sum condition
We need to find which pair of these multiples adds up to 176.
- 64 + 112 = 176 (but 112 is not between 50 and 100, and not a multiple of 16 in the given range)
- 80 + 96 = 176 (both are multiples of 16 and within the range)

## Step 6: Identify the larger number of the pair that satisfies both conditions

The problem states that the price of rice was 1080 Tk per quintal before the harvest. During the rainy season, the price of rice increased by 15%. A farmer who sold 12 quintals of rice before the harvest wants to know how much more money he would have received if he had sold the same amount of rice during the rainy season.

## Step 2: Calculate the original price received by the farmer before the harvest
The original price per quintal is 1080 Tk. The farmer sold 12 quintals, so the total amount received is 12 * 1080 = 12960 Tk.

## Step 3: Calculate the new price per quintal after the 15% increase
The new price per quintal can be calculated by finding 15% of the original price and adding it to the original price. 15% of 1080 is 0.15 * 1080 = 162. So, the new price per quintal is 1080 + 162 = 1242 Tk.

## Step 4: Calculate the total amount the farmer would have received during the rainy season
If the farmer had sold 12 quintals of rice during the rainy season, he would have received 12 * 1242 = 14904 Tk.

## Step 5: Calculate the difference in the amount received
To find out how much more money the farmer would have received, we subtract the original amount from the new amount: 14904 - 12960 = 1944 Tk.

The problem states that on this year's Republic Day, the physical education teacher in our school made us stand in rows of 12, 15, and 20 at different times and perform various drills. At one point, we were sitting in a square formation. The problem asks for the minimum number of students present in school that day.

## Step 2: Identify the key requirement for the number of students.
To find the minimum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, and 20 since the number of students must be divisible by each of these numbers to form the respective rows without any remainder.

## Step 3: Calculate the LCM of 12, 15, and 20.
First, break down the numbers into their prime factors:
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 20 = 2^2 * 5

## Step 4: Determine the LCM from the prime factors.
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
- For 2, the highest power is 2^2 (from 12 and 20)
- For 3, the power is 3^1 (from 12 and 15)
- For 5, the power is 5^1 (from 15 and 20)
Thus, the LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60

## Step 5: Consider the square formation requirement.
Since the students were also arranged in a square formation, the total number of students must be a perfect square. The LCM found (60) is not a perfect square, so we need to find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60.

## Step 6: Find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60.
To make 60 a perfect square, we need to multiply it by a number that will make each prime factor's exponent even. Since 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, and we have one 3 and one 5, we need another 3 and another 5 to make it a perfect square.
So, we multiply 60 by 3 * 5 = 15 to get 60 * 15 ="

The problem states that a person has 5000 units of money, which is to be divided between two people such that the first person's share is four times that of the second person. Additionally, if 1500 units are transferred from the first person to the second, their shares become equal. We need to find the initial amount of money the second person had.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the amount of money the first person initially has as ""x"" and the amount the second person initially has as ""y"".

## Step 3: Formulate the equations based on the given conditions.
From the problem, we have two conditions:
1. The total amount of money is 5000, so x + y = 5000.
2. The first person's amount is four times the second person's, so x = 4y.
3. After transferring 1500 from the first person to the second, their amounts become equal, so x - 1500 = y + 1500.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
First, we use the equation x = 4y and substitute x in the equation x + y = 5000, which gives us 4y + y = 5000, simplifying to 5y = 5000. Solving for y gives y = 5000 / 5 = 1000.

## Step 5: Verify the solution with the third condition.
If y = 1000, then x = 4y = 4000. Transferring 1500 from the first person to the second gives the first person 4000 - 1500 = 2500 and the second person 1000 + 1500 = 2500, confirming that their amounts become equal after the transfer.

## Step 6: Determine the initial amount of money the second person had.
Based on the calculation in step 4, the second person initially had 1000 units of money.

The final answer is: **1000**"

The problem states that for a two-digit number, when 7 is added to the sum of its digits, the result is three times the digit in the tens place. However, when 18 is subtracted from the number, the digits swap places.

## Step 2: Define the two-digit number.
Let's define the two-digit number as 10a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the tens place and 'b' is the digit in the ones place.

## Step 3: Formulate the equation based on the given condition.
According to the problem, the sum of the digits plus 7 equals three times the digit in the tens place. This can be written as: a + b + 7 = 3a.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation from Step 3.
Simplifying the equation, we get: b + 7 = 2a, which can be further simplified to b = 2a - 7.

## Step 5: Formulate the equation for the condition when 18 is subtracted.
When 18 is subtracted from the original number, the digits swap places. This can be represented as: 10a + b - 18 = 10b + a.

## Step 6: Simplify the equation from Step 5.
Rearranging the equation, we get: 10a + b - 18 = 10b + a, which simplifies to 9a - 9b = 18, and further simplifies to a - b = 2.

## Step 7: Solve the system of equations.
We have two equations: b = 2a - 7 and a - b = 2. We can substitute the value of b from the first equation into the second equation: a - (2a - 7) = 2, which simplifies to -a + 7 = 2.

## Step 8: Solve for 'a'.
Solving the equation -a + 7 = 2 for 'a', we get: -a = -5, which gives a = 5.

## Step 9: Solve for 'b'.
Substituting the value of 'a' into the equation b = 2a - 7, we get: b = 2*5 - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3.

The problem states that there are two smallest consecutive numbers whose squares have a difference that is a perfect square. We need to find the smaller of these two numbers.

## Step 2: Define the problem mathematically.
Let's denote the smaller number as x. Since the numbers are consecutive, the larger number is x + 1. The difference between their squares is (x + 1)^2 - x^2.

## Step 3: Expand the equation for the difference of squares.
Expanding (x + 1)^2 - x^2 gives us x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2, which simplifies to 2x + 1.

## Step 4: Determine the condition for the difference to be a perfect square.
For the difference to be a perfect square, 2x + 1 must equal a square number, let's call it y^2, where y is an integer.

## Step 5: Find the smallest x that satisfies the condition.
We are looking for the smallest x where 2x + 1 = y^2. Since x and y are integers, and we are seeking the smallest possible values, we start with the smallest odd perfect square, which is 1^2 = 1, but 2x + 1 = 1 does not give us an integer x. The next odd perfect square is 3^2 = 9. Setting 2x + 1 = 9 gives us 2x = 8, which simplifies to x = 4.

## Step 6: Verify the solution.
If x = 4, then x + 1 = 5. The squares are 4^2 = 16 and 5^2 = 25. The difference is 25 - 16 = 9, which is indeed a perfect square (3^2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

The problem translates to: ""After India's independence, up to the year 2024, a total of _____ years have been leap years.""

## Step 2: Determine the starting year of independence
India gained independence in 1947.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of years from 1947 to 2024
To find the total number of years, we subtract the starting year from the ending year and then add 1 to include the ending year itself. total_years = 2024 - 1947 + 1 = 78.

## Step 4: Identify the leap years within this period
Leap years occur every 4 years. We need to count how many leap years have occurred from 1948 (the first potential leap year after independence) to 2024.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of leap years
The first leap year after independence would be 1948, and the last one in the given range would be 2024. To find the number of leap years, we calculate the number of 4-year periods from 1948 to 2024. Since 2024 is a leap year, we include it. The formula to calculate the number of leap years is: (last_leap_year - first_leap_year) / 4 + 1. Applying this: (2024 - 1948) / 4 + 1 = 76 / 4 + 1 = 19 + 1 = 20 (including both 1948 and 2024 as leap years, but considering the calculation starts from 1948, the correct approach should directly count the leap years without needing to adjust the formula).

## Step 6: Adjust the calculation to accurately reflect the counting of leap years
Starting from 1948, we count every 4th year as a leap year until 2024, which directly gives us the count of leap years without needing the formula adjustment. Thus, counting directly: 1948, 1952, ..., 2020, 2024, there are 20 leap years (including 1948 and 2024).

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

The problem states that the ratio of copper, silver, and gold in an ornament is 3:5. Additionally, it provides the ratios of copper to silver as 1:2 and silver to gold as 3:5. We are asked to find the amount of gold in a 19-gram ornament.

## Step 2: Establish the given ratios
We have three pieces of information regarding the ratios:
1. Copper : Silver : Gold = 3 : 5
2. Copper : Silver = 1 : 2
3. Silver : Gold = 3 : 5

## Step 3: Find a common ratio for all three metals
To simplify, let's adjust the ratios so they align with each other. Given Copper : Silver = 1 : 2, we can express this as 3 : 6 to match the scale of the first ratio (since 3 is the multiplier for copper in the first ratio). For Silver : Gold = 3 : 5, to match the silver quantity in the adjusted copper-silver ratio, we find the least common multiple for silver in both ratios. However, we must consider that the initial total ratio given already accounts for all three metals, so let's directly use the given total ratio for calculations involving all three metals.

## Step 4: Determine the amount of gold in 19 grams of the ornament
Given the total ratio of Copper : Silver : Gold = 3 : 5, and knowing that these ratios add up to parts of the whole, we need to find how many grams of the 19-gram ornament are gold. The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 5 = 8 parts for copper and silver, but since we're considering all three metals, the correct total parts should reflect the complete ratio given, which is 3 (copper) + 5 (silver) + an implied part for gold. However, the direct ratio of interest for calculation purposes, especially considering the misstep in simplification, should directly utilize the provided ratios for a complete understanding.

## Step 5: Correctly apply the given ratios to find gold content
Considering the entire ornament's composition and focusing on the silver to gold ratio (3:5), and knowing the ornament's total weight is 19 grams, we must first accurately determine the proportion of gold in the ornament based on the given ratios. Since we initially misunderstood the application of ratios, let's correctly"

The problem states that the length of a rectangular land is three times its width, and the perimeter of the land is 40 meters. We need to find the length of the land.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the dimensions of the rectangular land.
Let's denote the width of the land as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is three times the width, so L = 3W.

## Step 3: Write down the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and substitute the given information.
The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W. We know that the perimeter (P) is 40 meters and L = 3W. Substituting these into the formula gives us 40 = 2(3W) + 2W.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for W.
Simplifying the equation, we get 40 = 6W + 2W, which further simplifies to 40 = 8W. Solving for W, we find W = 40 / 8 = 5 meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the length of the land using the relationship between L and W.
Since L = 3W and we found W = 5 meters, the length (L) is L = 3 * 5 = 15 meters.

The problem states that Faiaz and Ayaz had some apples. If Faiaz gives 10 apples to Ayaz, then Ayaz would have three times the number of apples that Faiaz has. On the other hand, if Ayaz gives 20 apples to Faiaz, then Faiaz would have twice the number of apples that Ayaz has. We need to find out how many apples Ayaz had initially.

## Step 2: Define variables for the initial number of apples
Let's denote the initial number of apples Faiaz had as F and the initial number of apples Ayaz had as A.

## Step 3: Set up the first equation based on the given condition
According to the problem, if Faiaz gives 10 apples to Ayaz, then Ayaz would have three times the number of apples that Faiaz has. This can be written as: A + 10 = 3(F - 10).

## Step 4: Simplify the first equation
Simplifying the equation from step 3: A + 10 = 3F - 30, which further simplifies to A = 3F - 40.

## Step 5: Set up the second equation based on the given condition
If Ayaz gives 20 apples to Faiaz, then Faiaz would have twice the number of apples that Ayaz has. This can be written as: F + 20 = 2(A - 20).

## Step 6: Simplify the second equation
Simplifying the equation from step 5: F + 20 = 2A - 40, which further simplifies to F = 2A - 60.

## Step 7: Substitute the expression for F from step 6 into the equation from step 4
Substituting F = 2A - 60 into A = 3F - 40 gives A = 3(2A - 60) - 40.

## Step 8: Solve for A
Expanding the equation from step 7: A = 6A - 180 - 40, which simplifies to A = 6A - 220. Subtracting 6A from both sides gives -5A = -220. Dividing both sides by -5 gives A = 44.

The problem states that it costs 7200 rupees to carpet the floor of a room. If the room's width were 3 meters less, the cost would be 576 rupees less.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the width of the room as W and the length as L. The cost of carpeting the room is directly proportional to the area of the room.

## Step 3: Formulate the relationship between the area and the cost.
The original cost is 7200 rupees for the area of W * L. If the width were 3 meters less, the new cost would be 7200 - 576 = 6624 rupees for the area of (W - 3) * L.

## Step 4: Express the relationship in terms of area.
The area of the original room is W * L, and the area of the reduced room is (W - 3) * L. The cost per unit area is constant, so we can set up a proportion based on the costs and areas.

## Step 5: Set up the equation based on the given costs.
Since the cost is directly proportional to the area, we can write the equation as W * L = 7200 / cost_per_unit_area and (W - 3) * L = 6624 / cost_per_unit_area. However, we don't know the cost_per_unit_area. Instead, we can directly relate the areas and costs: (W * L) / ((W - 3) * L) = 7200 / 6624.

## Step 6: Simplify the equation by canceling out L.
L is present in both the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out: W / (W - 3) = 7200 / 6624.

## Step 7: Solve for W.
First, simplify the fraction on the right side: 7200 / 6624 = 100 / 92.25 (approximately), but to keep precision, let's work with the exact numbers. The equation is W / (W - 3) = 7200 / 6624. Cross-multiplying gives 6624W = 7200(W - 3).

## Step 8: Expand and solve the equation for W.
Expanding the equation gives 6624W = 7200W - 21600."

The problem states that the front wheel of an engine has a circumference of 1.4 meters, and the rear wheel has a circumference that is 2.5 times the circumference of the front wheel. We need to calculate the minimum distance required for both wheels to complete a whole number of rotations at the same time.

## Step 2: Calculate the circumference of the rear wheel.
Given that the circumference of the front wheel is 1.4 meters and the rear wheel's circumference is 2.5 times that of the front wheel, we can calculate the rear wheel's circumference as 1.4 * 2.5 = 3.5 meters.

## Step 3: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the circumferences of the two wheels.
To find the minimum distance required for both wheels to complete a whole number of rotations at the same time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their circumferences. The LCM of 1.4 and 3.5 can be calculated by first converting these numbers into fractions or finding their prime factors. However, since 1.4 = 14/10 = 7/5 and 3.5 = 35/10 = 7/2, we see that the LCM of 7/5 and 7/2 is essentially the LCM of 5 and 2 multiplied by 7, which is 7 * 10 = 70, since 5 and 2 are co-prime (their LCM is simply their product).

## Step 4: Calculate the minimum distance required.
The LCM of the circumferences of the two wheels is 70 (in tenths of a meter, considering the original values were in meters and the conversion for LCM calculation), meaning that for every 70/10 = 7 meters traveled, both wheels will have completed a whole number of rotations. Thus, the minimum distance required for both wheels to complete whole number rotations at the same time is when they travel a distance that is a multiple of their LCM, which we've identified as 7 meters based on the LCM calculation.

The problem states that there exists a smallest natural number such that when 72 is multiplied by it, the result is a perfect square. We need to find this smallest natural number.

## Step 2: Identify the prime factorization of 72 to understand its factors.
To find the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 72, results in a perfect square, we need to analyze the prime factorization of 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2.

## Step 3: Determine the factors needed to make 72 a perfect square.
For 72 to be a perfect square when multiplied by another number, each prime factor's exponent must be an even number. From the prime factorization (2^3 * 3^2), we see that the factor of 2 has an exponent of 3, which is odd, and the factor of 3 has an exponent of 2, which is even.

## Step 4: Calculate the smallest natural number needed.
Since the exponent of 2 is odd (3), we need one more factor of 2 (2^1) to make the exponent of 2 even (2^4), thus making the product a perfect square. The factor of 3 already has an even exponent, so no additional factor of 3 is needed. Therefore, the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 72, results in a perfect square is 2^1 = 2.

The problem describes a empty box with dimensions 3 meters in length, 2 meters in width, and 1 meter in height. Inside this box, a solid metal cube with a side length of 50 cm (or 0.5 meters) is placed. After filling the box with water and then removing the cube, we need to find the depth of the water.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the box.
To find the volume of the box, we multiply its length, width, and height. So, the volume of the box = 3 meters * 2 meters * 1 meter = 6 cubic meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cube.
The volume of a cube is found by cubing the length of its side. Therefore, the volume of the cube = 0.5 meters * 0.5 meters * 0.5 meters = 0.125 cubic meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of water in the box after the cube is removed.
When the cube is removed, the volume of water that remains in the box is equal to the volume of the box minus the volume of the cube. So, the volume of water = 6 cubic meters - 0.125 cubic meters = 5.875 cubic meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the depth of the water after the cube is removed.
The depth of the water can be found by dividing the volume of the water by the area of the base of the box. The base area of the box = 3 meters * 2 meters = 6 square meters. Therefore, the depth of the water = volume of water / base area = 5.875 cubic meters / 6 square meters.

## Step 6: Perform the final calculation for the depth of the water.
Depth of the water = 5.875 cubic meters / 6 square meters = 0.97917 meters.
