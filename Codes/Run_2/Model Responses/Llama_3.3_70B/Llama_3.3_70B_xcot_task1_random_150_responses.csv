The problem states that Tahsan bought two and a half dozen eggs from a store at a price of 120 taka per dozen and then found 3 eggs to be broken at home. We need to calculate the amount of money Tahsan lost due to the broken eggs.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the eggs.
First, let's determine the total cost of the eggs Tahsan bought. Since he bought two and a half dozen eggs at 120 taka per dozen, the total cost can be calculated as follows:
Total cost = (2.5 dozen) * (120 taka/dozen) = 2.5 * 120 = 300 taka.

## Step 3: Determine the cost per egg.
To find out the cost of each egg, we need to know that there are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, for 2.5 dozen eggs, the total number of eggs is 2.5 * 12 = 30 eggs.
The cost per egg can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the total number of eggs:
Cost per egg = Total cost / Total number of eggs = 300 taka / 30 eggs = 10 taka per egg.

## Step 4: Calculate the amount of money lost due to the broken eggs.
Since 3 eggs were found to be broken, the amount of money lost can be calculated by multiplying the number of broken eggs by the cost per egg:
Money lost = Number of broken eggs * Cost per egg = 3 eggs * 10 taka/egg = 30 taka.

The final answer is: **30**"

The problem states that Mina walks 200 meters in 4 minutes. We need to find out how many meters she can walk in half an hour.

## Step 2: Convert half an hour into minutes to have a common unit of time for calculation.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, half an hour is equal to 30 minutes.

The problem states that there are three bells of different colors. The red bell rings every 18 minutes, the yellow bell rings every 15 minutes, and the green bell rings every 12 minutes. They all rang together at 6 PM, and we need to find out when they will ring together again.

## Step 2: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals at which each bell rings.
To find when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18, 15, and 12 minutes. This is because the bells will ring together again when all three intervals coincide.

## Step 3: Calculate the LCM of 18, 15, and 12.
First, break down each number into its prime factors:
- 18 = 2 * 3^2
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
Then, take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- For 2, the highest power is 2^2 (from 12)
- For 3, the highest power is 3^2 (from 18)
- For 5, the power remains 5 (from 15)
So, the LCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180 minutes.

## Step 4: Convert the total minutes into hours and minutes to find the time when the bells will ring together again.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

## Step 5: Add the 3 hours to the initial time of 6 PM to find the final time.
6 PM + 3 hours = 9 PM.

The problem states that Owen, a doctor, went to the operation theater at 3:28 to perform a 3-hour long operation. His sister came to meet him at 5:36. We need to find out how many minutes she had to wait to meet Owen.

## Step 2: Calculate the time when the operation ends.
To find out when Owen's operation will end, we add the duration of the operation (3 hours) to the start time (3:28). Since 3 hours is equal to 180 minutes, adding this to 3:28 gives us the end time. First, convert 3:28 to minutes past midnight: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 28 minutes = 188 minutes. Then add 180 minutes (3 hours) to this: 188 minutes + 180 minutes = 368 minutes. Convert 368 minutes back to hours and minutes: 368 minutes / 60 = 6 hours and 8 minutes, which is 6:08.

## Step 3: Calculate the waiting time for Owen's sister.
Owen's sister arrives at 5:36. To find out how long she waits, we subtract the arrival time from the time the operation ends (6:08). First, convert both times into minutes past midnight: for 5:36, it's 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 36 minutes = 336 minutes; for 6:08, it's 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 8 minutes = 368 minutes.

The problem states that Rafiq bought two and a half dozen eggs from a store at a price of 14.40 dollars (or presumably a similar amount in the local currency, but for the sake of the problem, we'll consider it as dollars) per dozen and upon returning home, he found 4 eggs to be rotten. We need to calculate the total amount Rafiq spent.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the eggs before finding the rotten ones.
First, we need to find out how much two and a half dozen eggs cost. Since one dozen eggs cost $14.40, two and a half dozen eggs will cost 2.5 * $14.40.

The problem states that Parker sleeps for 8 hours every day, translated to English as: ""Parker sleeps 8 hours a day. If he woke up at 9 am today, what time did he go to sleep?""

2. Step-by-step solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Parker went to sleep, given that he sleeps for 8 hours and woke up at 9 am.
- Start by identifying the wake-up time, which is 9 am.
- Since Parker sleeps for 8 hours, we need to subtract 8 hours from the wake-up time to find out when he went to sleep.

The problem states that Amelia has painted all the outer surfaces of 6 identical cubic objects. We need to find the total number of surfaces Amelia painted.

## Step 2: Identify the number of surfaces of a single cubic object.
A cubic object has 6 faces (top, bottom, left, right, front, and back), 12 edges, and 8 vertices. However, when considering the surfaces that can be painted, we only count the faces.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of faces for 6 cubic objects.
Since each cubic object has 6 faces and there are 6 objects, the initial calculation might suggest 6 * 6 = 36 faces. However, we need to consider how these objects are arranged and which faces are outer surfaces.

## Step 4: Consider the arrangement of the cubic objects.
Given that the problem does not specify the arrangement, we'll assume the objects are placed in a way that some faces are in contact with each other (e.g., in a 2x3 arrangement). In such an arrangement, some of the faces will be inner surfaces (in contact with another cube's face) and not outer surfaces that can be painted.

## Step 5: Determine the outer surfaces in a 2x3 arrangement.
In a 2x3 arrangement of cubic objects, there are 8 corners, 12 edges (not corners), and the faces that are not in contact with another face. Each corner cube has 3 exposed faces, each edge cube (not on the corner) has 2 exposed faces if considering a linear arrangement, but in a 2x3 grid, the calculation needs to account for all exposed faces correctly.

## Step 6: Calculate the total exposed faces for painting.
For 6 cubes in a 2x3 arrangement:
- The corner cubes (4 in number, since we have a rectangular solid of cubes) contribute 3 faces each to the outside, totaling 12 faces.
- The middle cubes on the edges (4 in number, 2 on each of the longer sides, not including corners) contribute 2 faces each, adding 8 faces.
- The two inner cubes in the arrangement (one in each row of the 2x3 grid that isn't on an edge or corner) each contribute 1 face that is not in contact with any other cube (the top or bottom face, depending on the orientation), but since these faces"

The problem states that there is a 32-hour train journey from the East Coast to the West Coast. If the train starts its journey from the East Coast very early on a Saturday, we need to determine which day it will arrive at its destination.

## Step 2: Calculate the arrival time after the 32-hour journey.
Since the train travels for 32 hours, we can calculate the arrival time by adding 32 hours to the departure time. Given that the train departs very early on Saturday, we can consider the departure time as Saturday morning.

## Step 3: Determine the day of arrival.
To find the day of arrival, we need to add 32 hours to Saturday morning. There are 24 hours in a day, so 32 hours is equivalent to 1 day and 8 hours (since 32 = 24 + 8). Adding 1 day to Saturday brings us to Sunday, and then adding 8 more hours means the train will arrive on Sunday evening.

The problem states that a chocolate costs 2 taka. During Christmas, there was a discount of 57 paise (which is equivalent to 0.57 taka, since 100 paise = 1 taka) from the cost price. We need to find the original cost price of the chocolate.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the cost price, selling price, and discount.
The selling price (SP) is 2 taka, and there is a discount of 0.57 taka. Let's denote the cost price as CP. The formula relating these is SP = CP - discount.

## Step 3: Calculate the cost price using the given information.
Given that SP = 2 taka and the discount = 0.57 taka, we can set up the equation as follows: 2 = CP - 0.57.

The problem states that there are 8 animals on a farm, which are either ducks or dogs. The total number of legs among all the animals is 24. We need to find the number of ducks.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the number of ducks as D and the number of dogs as G. We know that D + G = 8, since there are 8 animals in total.

## Step 3: Determine the total number of legs based on the number of ducks and dogs.
Each duck has 2 legs, and each dog has 4 legs. The total number of legs can be expressed as 2D + 4G = 24.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the number of ducks.
We have two equations:
1. D + G = 8
2. 2D + 4G = 24

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2, giving us:
D + 2G = 12

## Step 5: Solve for the number of ducks using the system of equations.
Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:
(D + 2G) - (D + G) = 12 - 8
This simplifies to:
G = 4

## Step 6: Find the number of ducks using the value of G.
Now that we know G = 4, we can substitute this back into the equation D + G = 8:
D + 4 = 8
Subtract 4 from both sides:
D = 4

The problem states that Samuel joins coaching on New Year's Day and attends coaching every day without fail until November 4th, when the coaching closes. We need to find out how much Samuel has to pay in coaching fees, given that the daily coaching charge is 23 units of currency, and the year is not a leap year.

## Step 2: Determine the number of days from January 1st to November 4th in a non-leap year.
To calculate the total number of days, we need to sum the days in each month from January to October and add the days from November 1st to November 4th. The months January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have 31 days. The months April, June, September, and November have 30 days. February has 28 days in a non-leap year.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of days from January 1st to October 31st.
January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October has 31 days. So, the total number of days from January 1st to October 31st is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 304 days.

## Step 4: Add the days from November 1st to November 4th.
From November 1st to November 4th, there are 4 days.

## Step 5: Calculate the total number of coaching days.
Total coaching days = 304 days (from January 1st to October 31st) + 4 days (from November 1st to November 4th) = 308 days.

## Step 6: Calculate the total coaching fee.
Daily coaching charge = 23 units of currency. Total coaching fee = Total coaching days * Daily coaching charge = 308 days * 23 units/day.

The problem states that Colton buys a one-foot-long burger and shares half of it with his brother. We need to find out how many inches of the burger each person will get.

## Step 2: Convert the length of the burger from feet to inches
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the burger from feet to inches by multiplying 1 foot by 12 inches/foot. So, the burger is 1 * 12 = 12 inches long.

## Step 3: Calculate the length of the burger each person will get
Since Colton shares half of the burger with his brother, they will each get half of the total length. To find the length each person will get, we divide the total length of the burger (12 inches) by 2. So, each person will get 12 / 2 = 6 inches of the burger.

The problem states that Abir's mother said Jisan's birthday is in the month after April, but Abir is one month older than Jisan. We need to find the probability that Jisan's birthday is in June.

## Step 2: Determine the possible months for Jisan's birthday.
Since Jisan's birthday is in the month after April, the possible months for Jisan's birthday are May, June, July, August, September, October, and November.

## Step 3: Consider Abir's age in relation to Jisan's.
Abir is one month older than Jisan, which means if Jisan's birthday is in May, Abir's birthday must be in April. If Jisan's birthday is in June, Abir's birthday must be in May, and so on.

## Step 4: Identify the months where Abir can be one month older than Jisan.
Given the condition, Abir can be one month older than Jisan in the following scenarios:
- Jisan's birthday in May and Abir's in April,
- Jisan's birthday in June and Abir's in May,
- Jisan's birthday in July and Abir's in June,
- Jisan's birthday in August and Abir's in July,

The problem states that Sebastian works every day and receives a weekly salary of 1043 rupees. If Sebastian does not go to work for 2 days this week, how much salary will he receive?

## Step 2: Calculate Sebastian's daily salary.
To find out how much Sebastian will receive if he doesn't work for 2 days, we first need to determine his daily salary. Since he works 7 days a week, his daily salary can be calculated by dividing his weekly salary by 7. daily_salary = weekly_salary / 7 = 1043 / 7.

## Step 3: Perform the division to find the daily salary.
daily_salary = 1043 / 7 = 149.

## Step 4: Calculate the salary for the days Sebastian worked.
Since Sebastian did not work for 2 days, he worked for 7 - 2 = 5 days. The salary he will receive for the days he worked can be calculated by multiplying his daily salary by the number of days he worked. salary_received = daily_salary * 5.

## Step 5: Perform the multiplication to find the salary received.

The problem states that there is a 31-hour train journey from the East Coast to the West Coast. If the train starts its journey from the East Coast very early on Monday, we need to determine on which day it will arrive at its destination.

## Step 2: Calculate the duration of the journey in terms of days.
Since the journey takes 31 hours, we can break this down into days and remaining hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 31 hours is equal to 1 day and 7 hours (31 - 24 = 7).

## Step 3: Determine the day of arrival.
Given that the train starts its journey very early on Monday, we need to add the duration of the journey to find the day of arrival. After 1 day (24 hours), it will be Tuesday. Then, adding the remaining 7 hours, the train will arrive early in the morning on Tuesday, since 7 hours after midnight would still be morning.

The problem states that Robert starts preparing for the GRE entrance exam in January. He prepares until the 4th of a month when he has his written exam. We need to determine in which month Robert prepares for the exam.

## Step 2: Determine the duration of Robert's preparation.
Given that Robert starts preparing in January and his exam is on the 4th of a month, we can infer that his preparation period could either be entirely within January if the exam is in the same month, or it could extend into another month if the exam is in February.

## Step 3: Analyze the possibilities based on the exam date.
If the exam is on the 4th, considering January typically has 31 days, it's plausible for Robert to have started preparing at the beginning of January and taken his exam on January 4th. However, this seems too short a period for preparation, given the context implies a significant study period. On the other hand, if Robert started preparing in January and his exam was on February 4th, this would give him a more substantial preparation period, spanning across two months.

## Step 4: Consider the logical flow of preparation time.
Preparation for exams like the GRE typically requires several weeks to months of dedicated study. Given that Robert starts preparing in January and aims to take an exam early in a month (on the 4th), it makes more logical sense that his preparation period extends into February, culminating in the exam on February 4th.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on analysis.
Considering the typical duration required for GRE preparation and the information given, it's logical to conclude that Robert prepares for the exam in January and takes it in February, making the month of preparation for the exam January, but the context implies he prepares into February for the exam that occurs then.

The final answer is: **February**"

## Step 2: Determine the total number of fingers for 7 people.
Each person has 10 fingers (5 on each hand). To find the total number of fingers for 7 people, we multiply the number of fingers per person by the number of people: 10 fingers/person * 7 people = 70 fingers.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of times the sound will be made.
Since each finger has one nail that needs to be cut, and the sound is made each time a nail is cut, the total number of times the sound will be made is equal to the total number of fingers. Therefore, the sound will be made 70 times.

The final answer is: **Answer: 70**"

The problem translates to: ""There are 48 animal legs and a total of 15 animals on a farm. Some are ducks and some are horses. Determine the number of horses.""

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the number of ducks as D and the number of horses as H. We know that ducks have 2 legs and horses have 4 legs.

## Step 3: Create equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be turned into equations. First, the total number of animals is 15, which gives us the equation: D + H = 15. Second, the total number of legs is 48. Since ducks have 2 legs and horses have 4 legs, this gives us the equation: 2D + 4H = 48.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve these equations using either substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method for simplicity. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2, which gives us: D + 2H = 24.

## Step 5: Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation to eliminate D.
Subtracting the first equation (D + H = 15) from the modified second equation (D + 2H = 24) gives us: D + 2H - (D + H) = 24 - 15, which simplifies to H = 9.

## Step 6: Conclusion
We've determined the number of horses by solving the system of equations based on the total number of animals and their legs.

The problem states that Elias instructs each student in the class to sketch a Roman numeral corresponding to their roll number. The student with roll number 1 sketches the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 sketches the second Roman numeral, and so on. Finally, Elias collects all the sketches and finds that there are 6 sketches for each Roman numeral. We need to determine the number of students in the class.

## Step 2: Identify the Roman numerals and their corresponding roll numbers.
The first few Roman numerals are: I, V, X, L, C, D, M, which correspond to the numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, respectively. Since each student sketches a Roman numeral based on their roll number, we can assume that the roll numbers start from 1 and increment by 1 for each student.

## Step 3: Analyze the given information that there are 6 sketches for each Roman numeral.
Since there are 6 sketches for each Roman numeral, it means that each Roman numeral has been sketched 6 times. This implies that there are 6 students for each Roman numeral. We need to find the total number of students in the class.

## Step 4: Determine the total number of students in the class.
To find the total number of students, we need to find the total number of Roman numerals sketched. Since each Roman numeral has 6 sketches, we can divide the total number of sketches by 6 to get the number of Roman numerals. However, the problem does not provide the total number of sketches. Instead, it provides the information that each Roman numeral has 6 sketches.

## Step 5: Use the given information to deduce the number of students.
Let's assume that there are 'n' Roman numerals. Since each Roman numeral has 6 sketches, the total number of students is 6 times the number of Roman numerals (6n). However, we know that the number of Roman numerals is equal to the number of roll numbers, which starts from 1 and increments by 1 for each student. Therefore, the number of students is equal to the number of roll numbers.

The problem states that if it costs 79 Taka to fence each side of a square, then what is the total cost of fencing?

## Step 2: Understand the geometry of a square and the concept of perimeter.
A square has four equal sides. The perimeter of a square, which is the total length around its boundary, can be calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the formula for the perimeter (P) of a square is P = 4 * side length.

## Step 3: Apply the given cost to the perimeter formula to find the total cost.
Given that the cost to fence each side is 79 Taka, and knowing that a square has four equal sides, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost per side by the number of sides. total_cost = cost_per_side * number_of_sides = 79 * 4.

## Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
To find the total cost, we multiply 79 Taka by 4 (since there are four sides to a square). total_cost = 79 * 4 = 316 Taka.

The problem states that Harper decides to visit a nearby farm that has a total of 11 animals. At the entrance, she sees the legs of the animals in a row and counts a total of 30 legs. She already knows that the farm only has ducks and horses. We need to determine the number of horses.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the number of horses as H and the number of ducks as D. We know that horses have 4 legs and ducks have 2 legs.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be turned into equations. First, the total number of animals is 11, which gives us the equation: H + D = 11. Second, the total number of legs is 30, which gives us the equation: 4H + 2D = 30.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve these equations using either substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method for simplicity. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of D: 2H + 2D = 22. Then, we subtract this new equation from the second equation to eliminate D: (4H + 2D) - (2H + 2D) = 30 - 22, which simplifies to 2H = 8.

## Step 5: Find the value of H.
Dividing both sides of the equation 2H = 8 by 2 gives us H = 4.

## Step 6: Conclusion.
Therefore, the number of horses on the farm is 4.

The problem states that Asha, a teacher, instructs each student in her class to sketch a Roman numeral corresponding to their roll number. The student with roll number 1 sketches the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 sketches the second Roman numeral, and so on. Finally, Asha collects all the sketches and finds that there are 5 sketches for each Roman numeral.

## Step 2: Identify the Roman numerals and their corresponding sketch counts.
The Roman numerals are: I, V, X, L, C, D, M. However, the problem does not explicitly state which Roman numerals are being sketched. Since each Roman numeral has 5 sketches, we can infer that the students sketched the first 'n' Roman numerals, where 'n' is the number of unique Roman numerals sketched.

## Step 3: Determine the total number of students based on the sketch count.
Since each Roman numeral has 5 sketches, and there are 'n' Roman numerals, the total number of students is 5 * n.

## Step 4: Find the value of 'n' based on the given conditions.
The problem states that each student sketches a Roman numeral corresponding to their roll number. This implies that the number of students is equal to the number of unique Roman numerals sketched. However, the problem does not provide a clear limit on the number of Roman numerals. We can assume that the students sketched the first 'n' Roman numerals, but without a clear limit, we need to consider a different approach.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate the problem and consider a different approach.
Since each Roman numeral has 5 sketches, we can infer that there are 5 students for each Roman numeral. The problem states that the student with roll number 1 sketches the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 sketches the second Roman numeral, and so on. This implies that the number of students is equal to the number of Roman numerals multiplied by 5.

## Step 6: Determine the total number of students based on the number of Roman numerals.
Let's assume the students sketched the first 'n' Roman numerals. In this case, the total number of students would be 5 * n. However, without a clear limit on the number of Roman numerals, we need to consider the fact that there are 7 basic Roman numer"

The problem states that buses from company A leave a bus station every 15 minutes, and buses from company B leave every 25 minutes. If buses from both companies leave together at 8:45 AM, we need to find out where the next time they will leave together.

## Step 2: Determine the time interval between the departures of the two companies' buses.
To find the next time the buses from both companies leave together, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals at which they leave, which are 15 minutes and 25 minutes.

## Step 3: Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 25.
The multiples of 15 are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270, 285, 300, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 75, which means the buses will leave together every 75 minutes.

## Step 4: Calculate the next departure time after 8:45 AM.
Since the buses leave together every 75 minutes, we need to add 75 minutes to 8:45 AM to find the next time they will leave together.

The problem states that Santiago left his home country in January and spent several months in Australia before returning on the same date in December. We need to determine how many months Santiago spent in Australia.

## Step 2: Determine the number of months from January to December.
Since Santiago left in January and returned in December, we can count the months in between. The months are January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December.

## Step 3: Subtract the starting month from the total number of months to find the duration of stay.
However, since the problem specifies that Santiago returned on the same date in December as he left in January, it indicates he was away for the entirety of the year except for the initial January and final December, which are partial months. Thus, we should consider the full months in between.

## Step 4: Count the full months Santiago spent in Australia.
The full months are February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, and November. This totals 10 full months from February to November, plus the partial months of January (after the date he left) and December (until the date he returned), which are not fully counted as they are partial.

## Step 5: Consider the partial months.
Given that Santiago left in January and returned in December on the same date, the partial months (the part of January after he left and the part of December before he returned) effectively cancel each other out in terms of counting full months because his departure and return dates are the same, implying a complete cycle of months in between.

## Step 6: Calculate the total months spent in Australia.
Therefore, we only need to count the months from February to November inclusively because January and December are considered as part of his travel, not his stay. This calculation yields 10 months (from February to November) plus any additional time from his departure in January to the end of January and from the beginning of December to his return in December, which, as explained, cancels out in terms of full month count but indicates his stay includes the entirety of the months in between.

The problem states that Hannah's laptop was fully charged at 3:20 PM, after which she started watching a 3-hour series. Her laptop shut down at 5:44 PM when the battery was fully discharged. We need to find out how many more minutes of the movie Hannah has left to watch.

## Step 2: Calculate the total time Hannah's laptop was on
To find the total time Hannah's laptop was on, we subtract the start time from the end time. The start time is 3:20 PM, and the end time is 5:44 PM. The difference between these two times is 2 hours and 24 minutes.

## Step 3: Convert the total time to minutes
We convert 2 hours and 24 minutes to minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = 120 minutes. Adding 24 minutes to this gives us a total of 144 minutes.

## Step 4: Calculate the total time of the movie in minutes
The movie is 3 hours long. We convert this to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

## Step 5: Calculate the remaining time of the movie
To find out how much of the movie Hannah has left to watch, we subtract the time her laptop was on from the total time of the movie. So, 180 minutes (total movie time) - 144 minutes (time laptop was on) = 36 minutes.

The final answer is: **36**"

The problem states that there are 38 animal legs and a total of 12 animals on a farm. The animals are either chickens or sheep. We need to determine the number of chickens.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of sheep as S. Since each chicken has 2 legs and each sheep has 4 legs, we can set up equations based on the given information.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the total number of animals and the total number of legs.
We have two pieces of information: the total number of animals is 12, and the total number of legs is 38. This gives us two equations:
1. C + S = 12 (since there are 12 animals in total)
2. 2C + 4S = 38 (since chickens have 2 legs and sheep have 4 legs)

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve these equations using either substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method for simplicity.

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
C + 2S = 19

Now, we subtract the first equation from this modified second equation to eliminate C:
(C + 2S) - (C + S) = 19 - 12
This simplifies to:
S = 7

## Step 5: Find the number of chickens.
Now that we know there are 7 sheep, we can substitute S = 7 into the first equation (C + S = 12) to find the number of chickens:
C + 7 = 12
C = 12 - 7
C = 5

The final answer is: **5**"

Rafiq bought one and a half dozen eggs from a shop at 120 taka per dozen and went home. After going home, he found 6 eggs were rotten. However, how much did Rafiq spend?

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the eggs.
First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Rafiq bought. Since he bought one and a half dozen eggs, this equals 1.5 dozen eggs.

## Step 3: Determine the cost per dozen eggs and calculate the total cost.
The cost per dozen eggs is 120 taka. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the cost per dozen eggs by the number of dozen eggs purchased: 1.5 * 120 = 180 taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of eggs in one and a half dozen.
Since one dozen contains 12 eggs, one and a half dozen will contain 1.5 * 12 = 18 eggs.

## Step 5: Determine the number of rotten eggs and the remaining good eggs.
Rafiq found 6 eggs to be rotten, so the number of good eggs is 18 - 6 = 12 eggs.

## Step 6: Calculate the cost per egg.
To find the cost per egg, we divide the total cost by the total number of eggs: 180 / 18 = 10 taka per egg.

## Step 7: Calculate the cost of the good eggs and the rotten eggs.
The cost of the good eggs is 12 * 10 = 120 taka, and the cost of the rotten eggs is 6 * 10 = 60 taka.

## Step 8: Determine the total amount spent by Rafiq.
However, since the question asks for the total amount spent by Rafiq, we should consider the total cost of the eggs he bought, regardless of whether they were rotten or not. Thus, the total amount spent is the cost of one and a half dozen eggs, which we already calculated as 180 taka.

The problem states that there is a farm with a total of 60 animal legs and 20 animals. It mentions that some are chickens and some are goats, and we need to find out the number of goats.

## Step 2: Define the variables for chickens and goats.
Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of goats as G. We know that chickens have 2 legs and goats have 4 legs.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two key pieces of information: the total number of animals (20) and the total number of legs (60). This gives us two equations:
1. C + G = 20 (since the total number of animals is 20)
2. 2C + 4G = 60 (since chickens have 2 legs and goats have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 60)

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve these equations to find the values of C and G. Let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2, which gives us:
C + 2G = 30

## Step 5: Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation to solve for G.
If we subtract the first equation (C + G = 20) from the modified second equation (C + 2G = 30), we get:
(C + 2G) - (C + G) = 30 - 20
This simplifies to:
G = 10

The problem states that the total cost of fencing around a square park was 224 rupees (or units of currency). We need to find out how much it cost to fence each side of the square park.

## Step 2: Understand the geometry of the problem
Since the park is square, all sides are of equal length. Let's denote the length of one side as ""s"".

## Step 3: Determine the total length of fencing needed
The perimeter of a square (the total length around its boundary) is given by the formula P = 4s, where P is the perimeter and s is the length of one side.

## Step 4: Relate the cost to the perimeter
The total cost of fencing is given as 224 rupees, which corresponds to the total length of fencing needed, i.e., the perimeter of the square park.

## Step 5: Calculate the cost per unit length of fencing
However, to find the cost per side, we first need to understand that the cost is directly proportional to the length of fencing used. Since the total cost for the perimeter is 224 rupees, and the perimeter is 4s, we can set up a relationship where the cost per unit length of fencing times the total length equals the total cost.

## Step 6: Solve for the cost per side
Given that the total cost is for the entire perimeter (4s), to find the cost per side (s), we divide the total cost by 4, because each side of the square park is of equal length and thus requires the same amount of fencing.

## Step 7: Calculate the cost per side
Cost per side = Total cost / 4 = 224 / 4 = 56.

Rafiq bought half a dozen eggs from a shop at 144 taka per dozen and went home. After reaching home, he found 3 eggs were broken. However, how much money did Rafiq lose?

## Step 2: Determine the cost of one egg.
To find the cost of one egg, we divide the cost per dozen eggs by 12. cost_per_dozen = 144 taka, cost_per_egg = cost_per_dozen / 12 = 144 / 12 = 12 taka per egg.

## Step 3: Calculate the total cost of half a dozen eggs.
Since Rafiq bought half a dozen eggs, we calculate the cost as follows: half_dozen_eggs = 12 / 2 = 6 eggs, total_cost = cost_per_egg * half_dozen_eggs = 12 * 6 = 72 taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the loss due to the broken eggs.
Rafiq found 3 eggs were broken. The loss can be calculated as: loss = cost_per_egg * number_of_broken_eggs = 12 * 3 = 36 taka.

## Step 5: Determine Rafiq's total loss.
Rafiq's total loss is the cost of the broken eggs, which we calculated in the previous step.

The problem states: ""What is the probability that February 30th is Jisan's birthday?""

## Step 2: Identify the issue with the date given in the problem.
February 30th does not exist in the standard Gregorian calendar used internationally. February has 28 days in non-leap years and 29 days in leap years.

## Step 3: Consider the implications of a non-existent date for the probability calculation.
Since February 30th does not exist, it is impossible for this date to be anyone's birthday, including Jisan's. This means we are dealing with an impossible event.

## Step 4: Recall the definition of probability for impossible events.
In probability theory, an impossible event has a probability of 0. This is because the event cannot occur under any circumstances.

## Step 5: Apply the concept of impossible events to the problem at hand.
Given that February 30th is an impossible date, the probability that it is Jisan's birthday is 0.

The problem states that Tahsan bought half a dozen eggs from a store at a price of 132 taka per dozen and then found 6 eggs to be broken when he got home. We need to determine the amount of money Tahsan lost due to the broken eggs.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of half a dozen eggs.
First, we calculate the cost of half a dozen eggs. Since the price is given per dozen, we divide the price by 2 to get the cost of half a dozen eggs. Cost_per_dozen = 132 taka, Cost_per_half_dozen = Cost_per_dozen / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66 taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the cost per egg.
To find out the cost per egg, we divide the cost of half a dozen eggs by the number of eggs in half a dozen. Half a dozen contains 6 eggs. Cost_per_egg = Cost_per_half_dozen / 6 = 66 / 6 = 11 taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the total loss due to broken eggs.
Since 6 eggs were found to be broken, and we now know the cost per egg, we can calculate the total loss. Total_loss = Number_of_broken_eggs * Cost_per_egg = 6 * 11 = 66 taka.

The problem states that Asif's farm has animals with a total of 460 legs. We need to find out how many cows are in his farm.

## Step 2: Identify the number of legs for each type of animal.
Cows have 4 legs, and assuming the other animals are either cows or some other type with a different number of legs (like chickens with 2 legs or pigs with 4 legs), we need to figure out the combination that results in a total of 460 legs.

## Step 3: Determine the possible combinations of animals that could result in 460 legs.
Since we're only asked about cows and not given information about other types of animals, let's assume the farm only has cows for simplicity. Each cow has 4 legs.

The problem states that the price of a pencil is 6 taka, and Elizabeth has only 5 taka in her pocket. She borrowed 53 paise (which is equivalent to 0.53 taka) from her neighbor. We need to find out how much more money Elizabeth needs to buy a pencil.

## Step 2: Convert all amounts to the same unit for easier calculation
First, let's convert the price of the pencil and the amount Elizabeth has into paise for uniformity. Since 1 taka = 100 paise, the price of the pencil is 6 * 100 = 600 paise, and Elizabeth initially had 5 * 100 = 500 paise. After borrowing 53 paise, she now has 500 + 53 = 553 paise.

## Step 3: Calculate how much more money Elizabeth needs to buy a pencil
To find out how much more money Elizabeth needs, we subtract the amount she currently has from the price of the pencil. So, the additional amount needed is 600 - 553 = 47 paise.

It is already known that this farm only has chickens and buffaloes. We need to determine the number of buffaloes from this information.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the number of chickens and buffaloes.
Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of buffaloes as B. We know that chickens have 2 legs and buffaloes have 4 legs.

## Step 3: Formulate equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we can form two equations. The first equation comes from the total number of animals: C + B = 9. The second equation comes from the total number of legs: 2C + 4B = 26.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method for simplicity. First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2, which gives us: C + 2B = 13.

## Step 5: Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation to eliminate C.
Subtracting the first equation (C + B = 9) from the modified second equation (C + 2B = 13) gives us: B = 4.

The problem states that a teacher wants to divide 40 students and 24 student girls into groups such that each group has an equal number of students and girls, and no student is left out. We need to determine the maximum number of groups that can be formed and the number of students and girls in each group.

## Step 2: Identify the conditions for forming groups
To form groups with an equal number of students and girls, the number of students and girls in each group must be the same. Let's denote the number of students in each group as 'x' and the number of girls in each group as 'y'. Since the number of students and girls in each group must be equal, we can say x = y.

## Step 3: Determine the total number of students and girls
The total number of students is 40, and the total number of girls is 24.

## Step 4: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40 and 24
To find the maximum number of groups, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40 and 24. The GCD of 40 and 24 is 8.

## Step 5: Calculate the maximum number of groups
Since the GCD is 8, we can form groups with 8 students and 8 girls, but we don't have enough girls to form groups of 8. However, we can form groups with 8 students and a smaller number of girls. Let's calculate the number of groups that can be formed with 8 students. The number of groups of 8 students is 40 / 8 = 5. For the girls, we can form groups with a smaller number of girls, and the number of groups will be 24 / x, where x is the number of girls in each group.

## Step 6: Find the number of girls in each group
Since we want to form the maximum number of groups, we should find the largest possible number of girls in each group that is less than or equal to 8. We can see that 24 / 8 = 3, so we can form 8 groups with 3 girls in each group, but this will leave some girls remaining. However, if we form groups with a smaller number of girls, we can find a number that divides both 40 and 24 without leaving a remainder.

The problem states that Bryson bought 7 pairs of shoes on Thanksgiving. We need to find out the total number of new shoes he now has.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of shoes in 7 pairs.
Since each pair of shoes contains 2 shoes, we can calculate the total number of shoes by multiplying the number of pairs by 2. total_shoes = 7 * 2 = 14.

## Step 3: Provide the final numerical answer.
Since the problem asks for the total number of new shoes Bryson has, and we have calculated that he has 14 shoes from the 7 pairs, this directly answers the question.

The final answer is: **Answer: 14**"
140,বর্গাকার একটি পার্কের চারপাশে বেড়া দেওয়া হলো এবং বেড়ার মোট খরচ ছিল ১৭২ টাকা। প্রতিটি পাশে বেড়া খরচ কত?,৪৩,"## Step 1: Translate the problem into English for clarity.
The problem states that a square park has been fenced, and the total cost of fencing was 172 rupees (or units of currency). We need to find out the cost of fencing per side.

## Step 2: Determine the formula for the perimeter of a square.
Since the park is square, all sides are equal in length. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of one side.

## Step 3: Set up an equation based on the total cost and solve for the cost per side.
Let's denote the cost per side as 'c'. Since the total cost for fencing the entire square park is 172 rupees, we can set up the equation: 4c = 172, where 4c represents the total cost for all four sides.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for 'c'.
To find the cost per side (c), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4: c = 172 / 4.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of 'c'.
Perform the division to find the cost per side: c = 43.

The final answer is: **43**"

The problem states that Penelope observed 48 car wheels in a parking lot, and we need to find out how many cars are in the parking lot.

## Step 2: Determine the number of wheels per car.
Each car has 4 wheels.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of cars in the parking lot.
To find the number of cars, we divide the total number of wheels by the number of wheels per car. total_wheels = 48, wheels_per_car = 4. cars_in_lot = total_wheels / wheels_per_car = 48 / 4 = 12.

The final answer is: **12**"
