The problem states: ""If the number of elements in a set is 3, then the number of its proper subsets is?""

## Step 2: Understand the concept of proper subsets.
A proper subset is a subset that is not equal to the set itself. For a set with 'n' elements, the total number of subsets (including the empty set and the set itself) is given by 2^n. However, since we are interested in proper subsets, we need to exclude the set itself from this count.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of subsets for a set with 3 elements.
Using the formula 2^n, where n = 3, the total number of subsets is 2^3 = 8.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of proper subsets.
Since the set itself is not a proper subset, we subtract 1 from the total number of subsets to find the number of proper subsets. So, the number of proper subsets = total number of subsets - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7.

The problem states that 5 grams of hydrogen gas is mixed with 1.27 x 10^24 chlorine atoms, and we need to find out how many grams of chlorine gas were present.

## Step 2: Determine the molecular weight of hydrogen and chlorine gas
The molecular weight of hydrogen (H2) is 2 grams/mole, and the molecular weight of chlorine (Cl2) is 71 grams/mole (since each chlorine atom has a weight of approximately 35.5 grams/mole).

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of hydrogen gas
First, we calculate the number of moles of hydrogen gas. Given that 5 grams of hydrogen gas is used, we use the formula: moles = mass / molecular weight. So, moles of hydrogen = 5 / 2 = 2.5 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of chlorine atoms
The problem states there are 1.27 x 10^24 chlorine atoms. To find the number of moles, we divide this number by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mole). moles of chlorine atoms = 1.27 x 10^24 / (6.022 x 10^23) = 2.11 moles.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of moles of chlorine gas (Cl2)
Since chlorine gas is diatomic (Cl2), the number of moles of chlorine gas is half the number of moles of chlorine atoms. So, moles of chlorine gas = 2.11 / 2 = 1.055 moles.

## Step 6: Calculate the mass of chlorine gas
Using the molecular weight of chlorine gas (71 grams/mole), we can calculate the mass of chlorine gas: mass = moles * molecular weight = 1.055 * 71.

## Step 7: Perform the final calculation
mass of chlorine gas = 1.055 * 71 = 74.905 grams.

## Step 2: Identify the total number of outcomes.
There are 10 tickets in total, so there are 10 possible outcomes when picking one ticket.

## Step 3: Determine the favorable outcomes for multiples of 2.
The multiples of 2 from 1 to 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. So, there are 5 favorable outcomes for multiples of 2.

## Step 4: Determine the favorable outcomes for multiples of 3.
The multiples of 3 from 1 to 10 are 3, 6, and 9. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for multiples of 3.

## Step 5: Identify any overlap between multiples of 2 and 3.
The number 6 is a multiple of both 2 and 3. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract this overlap once.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes for multiples of 2 or 3.
The total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the favorable outcomes for multiples of 2 and multiples of 3, minus the overlap. total_favorable_outcomes = 5 (multiples of 2) + 3 (multiples of 3) - 1 (overlap) = 7.

## Step 7: Calculate the probability of picking a ticket that is a multiple of 2 or 3.
The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. probability = total_favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes = 7 / 10.

The problem states: ""17.75 grams of sodium sulfate is dissolved in a 450 ml solution. What is the density of the solution?""

## Step 2: Identify the given information.
We have 17.75 grams of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) dissolved in 450 ml of solution. The molar mass of Na2SO4 is approximately 142.04 g/mol.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of sodium sulfate.
To find the number of moles of Na2SO4, we use the formula: moles = mass / molar mass.
moles = 17.75 g / 142.04 g/mol ≈ 0.125 mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of the solution.
The mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of the solute (Na2SO4) and the mass of the solvent. Since we don't know the exact mass of the solvent, we'll assume the density of the solvent (water) is approximately 1 g/ml. Therefore, the mass of the solvent is approximately 450 ml * 1 g/ml = 450 g. The total mass of the solution is 17.75 g (Na2SO4) + 450 g (solvent) = 467.75 g.

## Step 5: Calculate the density of the solution.
The density of the solution can be calculated using the formula: density = mass / volume.
First, we need to convert the volume from milliliters (ml) to liters (L) or simply keep it in ml for the calculation since 1 ml = 1 cm^3, and density can be in g/ml or g/cm^3.
density = 467.75 g / 450 ml ≈ 1.04 g/ml.

The problem states that a cow is tied with a rope in such a way that it can graze on a circular field of 144 square meters. We need to find the diameter of the circular field.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a circle to relate the given area with the radius.
The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(A\) is the area and \(r\) is the radius of the circle. Given that the area \(A = 144\) square meters, we can use this formula to find the radius.

## Step 3: Solve for the radius using the given area.
Substitute the given area \(A = 144\) square meters into the area formula: \(144 = \pi r^2\). To find \(r\), we rearrange the formula to solve for \(r\): \(r^2 = \frac{144}{\pi}\). Then, take the square root of both sides to solve for \(r\): \(r = \sqrt{\frac{144}{\pi}}\).

## Step 4: Calculate the numerical value of the radius.
To find the numerical value of \(r\), we calculate \(\sqrt{\frac{144}{\pi}}\). Since \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), \(r \approx \sqrt{\frac{144}{3.14159}} \approx \sqrt{45.86} \approx 6.77\) meters.

## Step 5: Recall the relationship between the radius and the diameter of a circle.
The diameter \(d\) of a circle is twice the radius \(r\): \(d = 2r\). We will use this relationship to find the diameter of the circular field.

## Step 6: Calculate the diameter using the radius found in Step 4.
Using the radius \(r \approx 6.77\) meters from Step 4, we calculate the diameter: \(d = 2 \times 6.77 \approx 13.54\) meters.

The problem states: ""A wheel rotates 25 times to cover a distance of 3.25 km. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?""

## Step 2: Convert the distance from kilometers to meters
To find the diameter of the wheel, we first need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters. Since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters, the distance of 3.25 km is equal to 3.25 * 1000 = 3250 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the wheel
We know that the wheel rotates 25 times to cover a distance of 3250 meters. This means that the total distance covered by the wheel is equal to 25 times the circumference of the wheel. Let's denote the circumference of the wheel as C. Then, 25 * C = 3250.

## Step 4: Solve for the circumference of the wheel
Now, we can solve for the circumference of the wheel by dividing both sides of the equation by 25: C = 3250 / 25 = 130 meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the diameter of the wheel
The circumference of a circle (such as the wheel) is given by the formula C = π * d, where d is the diameter. Since we know the circumference (C = 130 meters), we can solve for the diameter: 130 = π * d. Rearranging the equation to solve for d, we get d = 130 / π.

## Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the diameter
Now, we can calculate the numerical value of the diameter using the approximate value of π (approximately 3.14159): d = 130 / 3.14159 ≈ 41.42 meters.

The problem states that a boy with a mass of 40 kg climbs stairs to the roof in 15 seconds. The stairs have 20 steps, and each step is 16 cm high. We need to calculate the amount of work done by the boy in joules.

## Step 2: Convert the height of each step from centimeters to meters.
To calculate the work done, we first need to find the total height the boy climbed. Since the height of each step is given in centimeters, we convert it to meters. 1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 16 cm = 0.16 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the total height climbed by the boy.
The total height climbed is the number of steps multiplied by the height of each step. Total height = 20 steps * 0.16 meters/step = 3.2 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the potential energy gained by the boy, which is equal to the work done.
The work done (W) in climbing the stairs is equal to the gain in potential energy (PE). The formula for potential energy is PE = m * g * h, where m is the mass of the boy (in kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height climbed (in meters).

## Step 5: Plug in the values to calculate the work done.
Using the formula PE = m * g * h, we substitute the given values: m = 40 kg, g = 9.81 m/s^2, and h = 3.2 meters. Calculating the work done: W = 40 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 3.2 meters.

The problem states: ""A body is tied with a thread and rotated once in a vertical plane, what is the amount of work done in joules?""

## Step 2: Understanding the concept of work done
To solve this problem, we need to understand that work done (W) is calculated as the product of the force applied (F) and the displacement (d) in the direction of the force. However, in the context of rotating an object, we should consider the torque and the angle of rotation. But given the object is simply rotated once without any specified force or torque, we must reconsider what ""work done"" implies in this scenario.

## Step 3: Analyzing the scenario
When an object is rotated, the work done can be related to the change in its potential or kinetic energy. However, the problem does not specify any change in height (which would relate to potential energy) or speed (which would relate to kinetic energy). It merely mentions the object being rotated once in a vertical plane.

## Step 4: Considering the implications of rotation
If the object is rotated once and ends up in the same position (implied by ""once"" in a circular motion), and assuming no external force is applied beyond what's necessary to initiate and maintain the rotation against friction (which isn't mentioned), the net work done in terms of increasing the object's energy (kinetic or potential) would be zero. This is because the rotation brings the object back to its original position without any net change in its energy state.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the information provided and the typical understanding of work done in physics, if an object is rotated once in a vertical plane and returns to its original position without any specified external force application or change in energy state, the amount of work done in terms of increasing its energy is zero.

## Step 2: Identify the initial and final masses.
The initial mass of blue vitriol is 249.5 grams, and the final mass of the white powder produced is 150 grams.

## Step 3: Calculate the percentage yield.
To find the percentage yield, we use the formula: (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100. However, since we are not given the theoretical yield directly, we first need to determine if the reaction is a decomposition reaction or another type, which would typically require a balanced chemical equation to calculate theoretical yield. For the purpose of this problem and the information given, we will proceed under the assumption that the percentage yield is to be calculated based on the mass of the reactant converted into product, without a detailed chemical equation provided.

## Step 4: Apply the percentage yield formula.
Given that we do not have the theoretical yield and assuming the problem seeks a simple ratio of product to reactant, the calculation simplifies to: (mass of product / mass of reactant) * 100 = (150 / 249.5) * 100.

The problem states that 50 grams of fluorine is passed through 4 grams of hydrogen gas. We need to find out how much hydrogen will react with fluorine.

## Step 2: Identify the chemical equation for the reaction between fluorine and hydrogen.
The reaction between fluorine (F2) and hydrogen (H2) produces hydrogen fluoride (HF). The balanced chemical equation is: F2 + H2 -> 2HF.

## Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant.
To find out how much hydrogen will react with fluorine, we need to determine the limiting reactant. The limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed in the reaction. We will calculate the number of moles of fluorine and hydrogen to determine the limiting reactant.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of fluorine and hydrogen.
The molar mass of fluorine (F2) is 38 g/mol, and the molar mass of hydrogen (H2) is 2 g/mol. We can calculate the number of moles of fluorine and hydrogen as follows:
Moles of fluorine = mass of fluorine / molar mass of fluorine = 50 g / 38 g/mol = 1.32 mol.
Moles of hydrogen = mass of hydrogen / molar mass of hydrogen = 4 g / 2 g/mol = 2 mol.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.
From the balanced chemical equation, we see that 1 mole of fluorine (F2) reacts with 1 mole of hydrogen (H2). Since we have 1.32 mol of fluorine and 2 mol of hydrogen, fluorine is the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of hydrogen that will react with fluorine.
Since fluorine is the limiting reactant, the amount of hydrogen that will react with fluorine is equal to the number of moles of fluorine, which is 1.32 mol. Therefore, the mass of hydrogen that will react is: mass of hydrogen = number of moles of hydrogen * molar mass of hydrogen = 1.32 mol * 2 g/mol = 2.64 g.

The problem states that the sum of two angles is 60 degrees and their difference is 30 degrees. We need to find the measure of the larger angle.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the two angles.
Let's denote the larger angle as L and the smaller angle as S.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
We have two pieces of information: the sum of the angles is 60 degrees and their difference is 30 degrees. This can be written as:
1. L + S = 60
2. L - S = 30

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
To find the values of L and S, we can solve these equations simultaneously. One way to do this is by adding the two equations together to eliminate S:
(L + S) + (L - S) = 60 + 30
This simplifies to:
2L = 90

## Step 5: Solve for L.
Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for L:
L = 90 / 2
L = 45

However, we need to ensure that L is indeed the larger angle by checking the value of S. To do this, we can substitute the value of L back into one of the original equations.

## Step 6: Substitute L back into one of the original equations to find S.
Using L + S = 60 and substituting L = 45:
45 + S = 60
Subtract 45 from both sides:
S = 15

## Step 7: Confirm that L is the larger angle.
Since 45 > 15, L is indeed the larger angle, confirming our solution.

The problem in English is: ""12 grams of magnesium will react with how many grams of oxygen?""

## Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction
The reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O2) is a combustion reaction, which produces magnesium oxide (MgO). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is 2Mg + O2 → 2MgO.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of magnesium and oxygen
The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.31 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O2) is approximately 32.00 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of magnesium
Given 12 grams of magnesium, we can calculate the number of moles of magnesium using the formula: moles = mass / molar mass. So, moles of Mg = 12 g / 24.31 g/mol ≈ 0.493 mol.

## Step 5: Determine the stoichiometry of the reaction
From the balanced chemical equation, we see that 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O2. Therefore, the ratio of Mg to O2 is 2:1.

## Step 6: Calculate the number of moles of oxygen required
Since 0.493 mol of Mg is available, and considering the stoichiometric ratio, the number of moles of O2 required is 0.493 mol / 2 ≈ 0.2465 mol.

## Step 7: Calculate the mass of oxygen required
Using the molar mass of O2 (32.00 g/mol), we can calculate the mass of O2 required: mass = moles * molar mass = 0.2465 mol * 32.00 g/mol ≈ 7.888 g.

The problem states that a mountain at a distance of 450 kilometers creates an angle of 7 degrees. We need to find the height of the mountain in meters.

## Step 2: Identify the given information
We have the distance to the mountain (450 km) and the angle created by the mountain (7 degrees). To use trigonometric functions, we need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters because the height of the mountain is required in meters. Since 1 km = 1000 meters, the distance in meters is 450 * 1000 = 450,000 meters.

## Step 3: Apply trigonometric principles
To find the height of the mountain, we can use the tangent function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height of the mountain) to the adjacent side (distance to the mountain) in a right-angled triangle. The formula is tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent. Here, the angle is 7 degrees, and the adjacent side is 450,000 meters. We rearrange the formula to solve for the height (opposite side): height = tan(7 degrees) * 450,000.

## Step 4: Calculate the height
Using a calculator, we find that tan(7 degrees) is approximately 0.1232. Now, we multiply this by the distance in meters: 0.1232 * 450,000.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation
0.1232 * 450,000 = 55,440.

The problem asks for the value of gravitational acceleration 500 km above the Earth's surface, given the Earth's mass as 5.98 x 10^24 kg and its radius as 6.37 x 10^6 meters.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for gravitational acceleration.
The formula for gravitational acceleration (g) at a distance (r) from the center of the Earth is given by g = G * M / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant (6.674 * 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2) and M is the mass of the Earth.

## Step 3: Calculate the distance from the center of the Earth to the point 500 km above its surface.
First, convert the height above the surface to meters: 500 km = 500,000 meters. The radius of the Earth is given as 6.37 x 10^6 meters. Thus, the distance from the center of the Earth to the point 500 km above its surface is r = 6.37 x 10^6 + 500,000 = 6.37 x 10^6 + 0.5 x 10^6 = 6.87 x 10^6 meters.

## Step 4: Apply the formula for gravitational acceleration using the given values.
Substitute the given values into the formula: g = G * M / r^2 = (6.674 * 10^-11) * (5.98 x 10^24) / (6.87 x 10^6)^2.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation.
Calculate the value of g: g = (6.674 * 10^-11) * (5.98 x 10^24) / (6.87 x 10^6)^2 = (6.674 * 10^-11) * (5.98 x 10^24) / (47.1619 x 10^12) = (6.674 * 10^-11) * (5.98 x 10^24) / (4.71619 x 10^13) = 39.8 m/s^2, approximately, after correcting the calculation step.

## Step 2: Determine the atomic masses of hydrogen and chlorine
To calculate the percentage of hydrogen in HCl, we first need to know the atomic masses of hydrogen and chlorine.

## Step 3: Find the atomic mass of hydrogen
The atomic mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008 g/mol.

## Step 4: Find the atomic mass of chlorine

The problem states: ""The radius of a circle is 10 cm. What is the measure of the central angle subtended by a 35 cm long arc of the circle?""

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the length of an arc of a circle.
The length of an arc of a circle can be calculated using the formula: arc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula.
Given that the radius (r) is 10 cm and the arc length is 35 cm, we can set up the equation as follows: 35 = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * 10.

## Step 4: Solve for the central angle.
Rearrange the equation to solve for the central angle: central angle = (35 * 360) / (2 * π * 10).

## Step 5: Calculate the central angle in degrees.
First, calculate the numerator: 35 * 360 = 12600. Then, calculate the denominator: 2 * π * 10 ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 10 ≈ 62.8318. Now, divide the numerator by the denominator: 12600 / 62.8318 ≈ 200.57 degrees, but since we're looking for the measure of the central angle in degrees and the formula directly gives us this, we should ensure to keep the calculation precise without approximation where unnecessary.

## Step 6: Precise calculation with π.
To keep precision, we calculate (35 * 360) / (2 * π * 10) directly: (35 * 360) / (2 * 3.14159 * 10) = 12600 / (20 * 3.14159) = 12600 / 62.8318.

## Step 7: Final calculation.
Given the precision needed, let's calculate directly without premature approximation: central angle = (12600) / (62.8318) ≈ 200.57 degrees, but recognizing that the division should reflect the precision of the input values, and considering the context of degrees which is already accounted for, the precise approach directly uses the given numbers without intermediate rounding.

The problem states that a bullet of 10 grams is shot from a gun at a speed of 400 m/s. The gun itself has a mass of 3/2 kilograms. We need to find the recoil speed of the gun.

## Step 2: Identify the physical principle governing the situation.
The principle of conservation of momentum applies here. Momentum before the shot is zero (assuming the system is at rest initially), so the total momentum after the shot must also be zero for the system as a whole.

## Step 3: Apply the principle of conservation of momentum.
Let's denote the mass of the bullet as \(m_b = 10 \, \text{g} = 0.01 \, \text{kg}\) and the mass of the gun as \(m_g = 3/2 \, \text{kg} = 1.5 \, \text{kg}\). The velocity of the bullet is given as \(v_b = 400 \, \text{m/s}\). We are looking for the recoil velocity of the gun, \(v_g\).

## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the conservation of momentum.
The momentum of the bullet is \(m_b \cdot v_b\) and the momentum of the gun is \(m_g \cdot v_g\). Since the initial momentum is zero, we have:
\[m_b \cdot v_b + m_g \cdot v_g = 0\]

## Step 5: Solve for \(v_g\).
Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[0.01 \, \text{kg} \cdot 400 \, \text{m/s} + 1.5 \, \text{kg} \cdot v_g = 0\]
\[4 + 1.5v_g = 0\]
\[1.5v_g = -4\]
\[v_g = -4 / 1.5\]
\[v_g = -\frac{8}{3} \, \text{m/s}\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of the recoil velocity, which is opposite to the direction of the bullet. However, since we're interested in the magnitude of the velocity:

## Step 6: Calculate the magnitude of the recoil velocity.

The problem states that 50 grams of fluorine is passed through 4 grams of hydrogen gas. We need to find the volume of the hydrogen gas that reacts, at standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction
The reaction between fluorine and hydrogen is: F2 + H2 -> 2HF. From the equation, we see that 1 mole of F2 reacts with 1 mole of H2 to produce 2 moles of HF.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of fluorine and hydrogen
The molecular weight of fluorine (F2) is 38 g/mol (since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, its molecular weight is 2 * 19 g/mol), and the molecular weight of hydrogen (H2) is 2 g/mol. The number of moles of fluorine is 50 g / 38 g/mol = 1.3158 mol. The number of moles of hydrogen is 4 g / 2 g/mol = 2 mol.

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant
Since 1 mole of F2 reacts with 1 mole of H2, and we have 1.3158 mol of F2 and 2 mol of H2, F2 is the limiting reactant because it has fewer moles than H2.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of moles of hydrogen that reacts
Since F2 is the limiting reactant, the number of moles of hydrogen that reacts is equal to the number of moles of F2, which is 1.3158 mol.

## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the hydrogen gas that reacts at STP
At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, the volume of the hydrogen gas that reacts is 1.3158 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 29.46 L.

The problem translates to: ""How many grams of sodium chloride are present in 250 ml of 0.2 molar sodium chloride solution?""

## Step 2: Determine the molar mass of sodium chloride (NaCl) to calculate the mass.
The molar mass of NaCl is calculated as the sum of the atomic masses of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). The atomic mass of Na is approximately 22.99 g/mol, and the atomic mass of Cl is approximately 35.45 g/mol. Thus, the molar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol = 58.44 g/mol.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of NaCl in 250 ml of 0.2 molar solution.
Given that the solution is 0.2 molar, this means there are 0.2 moles of NaCl per liter (1000 ml) of solution. To find the number of moles in 250 ml, we use the formula: moles = molarity * volume (in liters). So, moles = 0.2 M * (250 ml / 1000 ml) = 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.05 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of NaCl in 250 ml of the solution.
Using the molar mass of NaCl (58.44 g/mol) and the number of moles (0.05 moles), we can calculate the mass of NaCl: mass = moles * molar mass = 0.05 moles * 58.44 g/mol = 2.922 g.

## Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas involved in the problem.
To solve this problem, we will use the concept of potential energy and kinetic energy. The potential energy (PE) of an object is given by the formula PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height of the object above the ground. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the velocity of the object.

## Step 3: Calculate the potential energy of the object at the initial position.
The initial potential energy of the object can be calculated using the formula PE = mgh. Plugging in the values, we get PE = 5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 50 m = 2450 J.

## Step 4: Apply the law of conservation of energy to find the kinetic energy at the final position.
As the object falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy of the object remains constant. Therefore, the kinetic energy at the final position (just before touching the ground) is equal to the initial potential energy. This means KE = PE = 2450 J.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of hydrogen and chlorine
The molar mass of hydrogen (H2) is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 71 grams/mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of hydrogen and chlorine
Given that 1 gram of hydrogen is used, the number of moles of hydrogen is 1 / 2 = 0.5 moles. For chlorine, 70 grams are used, so the number of moles of chlorine is 70 / 71 ≈ 0.986 moles.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant
Since the reaction requires a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen to chlorine, and there are 0.5 moles of hydrogen, the reaction can only use 0.5 moles of chlorine to react completely with the hydrogen. This means hydrogen is the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of chlorine used
0.5 moles of chlorine are used in the reaction (since 0.5 moles of hydrogen are available and the ratio is 1:1). The mass of chlorine used is 0.5 moles * 71 grams/mole = 35.5 grams.

## Step 7: Calculate the amount of chlorine left over
The initial amount of chlorine was 70 grams. After using 35.5 grams in the reaction, the amount of chlorine left over is 70 - 35.5 = 34.5 grams.

The final answer is: **34.5**"

The problem states that we have a rectangular solid with a length of 8 cm, a diagonal of 9 cm, and a height of 4 cm. We need to find the width of this rectangular solid.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular solid.
The formula for the diagonal of a rectangular solid is given by \(d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}\), where \(d\) is the diagonal, \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula.
We are given that \(d = 9\) cm, \(l = 8\) cm, and \(h = 4\) cm. We need to find \(w\). Substituting these values into the formula gives us \(9 = \sqrt{8^2 + w^2 + 4^2}\).

## Step 4: Solve for \(w\).
Squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root gives \(9^2 = 8^2 + w^2 + 4^2\), which simplifies to \(81 = 64 + w^2 + 16\).

## Step 5: Simplify the equation further to isolate \(w^2\).
Combining like terms, we get \(81 = 80 + w^2\), which simplifies to \(w^2 = 81 - 80\), so \(w^2 = 1\).

## Step 6: Solve for \(w\).
Taking the square root of both sides to solve for \(w\) gives us \(w = \sqrt{1}\), which means \(w = 1\).

The problem states that Russell had 452 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 9 (in hexadecimal) to Karim. We need to find out how many bananas Russell has left in the hexadecimal number system.

## Step 2: Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation.
First, we convert 452 in hexadecimal to decimal: 452 (hex) = 4*16^2 + 5*16^1 + 2*16^0 = 4*256 + 5*16 + 2*1 = 1024 + 80 + 2 = 1106.
Then, we convert 9 in hexadecimal to decimal: 9 (hex) = 9*16^0 = 9.

## Step 3: Subtract the number of bananas given away from the total number of bananas Russell had.
Now, we subtract the number of bananas given to Karim (9 in decimal) from the total number of bananas Russell had (1106 in decimal): 1106 - 9 = 1097.

## Step 4: Convert the result back to hexadecimal.
To convert 1097 to hexadecimal, we divide it by 16 and keep track of the remainders:
1097 / 16 = 68 remainder 9,
68 / 16 = 4 remainder 4,
4 / 16 = 0 remainder 4.

The problem asks for the molecular weight of 15 moles of sulfur dioxide (SO2).

## Step 2: Identify the atomic weights of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) from the periodic table.
The atomic weight of sulfur (S) is approximately 32.07 g/mol, and the atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.

## Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of one mole of sulfur dioxide (SO2).
The molecular formula for sulfur dioxide is SO2, which means it consists of one sulfur atom and two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the molecular weight of SO2 is calculated as follows: Molecular weight of SO2 = (1 * atomic weight of S) + (2 * atomic weight of O) = (1 * 32.07) + (2 * 16.00) = 32.07 + 32.00 = 64.07 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the total weight of 15 moles of sulfur dioxide.
To find the total weight of 15 moles of SO2, we multiply the molecular weight of one mole of SO2 by 15: Total weight = 15 * molecular weight of SO2 = 15 * 64.07 = 960.95 g.

The problem states that 1 gram of hydrogen reacts with 85 grams of chlorine to produce hydrochloric acid, and we need to find out how much chlorine is left over after the reaction is complete.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine to form hydrochloric acid.
The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: H2 + Cl2 -> 2HCl.

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of the reactants.
The molar mass of hydrogen (H2) is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 71 grams/mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of hydrogen and chlorine.
Number of moles of hydrogen = mass of hydrogen / molar mass of hydrogen = 1 g / 2 g/mole = 0.5 moles.
Number of moles of chlorine = mass of chlorine / molar mass of chlorine = 85 g / 71 g/mole = 1.197 moles.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant.
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1 mole of Cl2. Since there are 0.5 moles of H2 and 1.197 moles of Cl2, H2 is the limiting reactant because it will be completely consumed first.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of chlorine that reacts with hydrogen.
Since 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1 mole of Cl2, 0.5 moles of H2 will react with 0.5 moles of Cl2.
Mass of Cl2 that reacts = number of moles of Cl2 that reacts * molar mass of Cl2 = 0.5 moles * 71 g/mole = 35.5 g.

## Step 7: Calculate the amount of chlorine left over after the reaction.
Mass of chlorine left over = initial mass of chlorine - mass of chlorine that reacts = 85 g - 35.5 g = 49.5 g.

The problem states that two objects of masses 15 kg and 10 kg are moving towards each other on the same road with speeds of 3 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively. After a head-on collision, they stick together. We need to find the combined velocity of the objects after the collision.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant physical principle

The principle of conservation of momentum applies to this problem. According to this principle, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

## Step 3: Calculate the momentum of each object before the collision

The momentum of an object is given by the product of its mass and velocity. Therefore, the momentum of the 15 kg object is 15 kg * 3 m/s = 45 kg*m/s, and the momentum of the 10 kg object is 10 kg * 5 m/s = 50 kg*m/s. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we consider the momentum of the 10 kg object as negative, so the total momentum before the collision is 45 kg*m/s - 50 kg*m/s = -5 kg*m/s.

## Step 4: Calculate the combined mass of the objects after the collision

The combined mass of the objects after the collision is the sum of their individual masses, which is 15 kg + 10 kg = 25 kg.

## Step 5: Apply the principle of conservation of momentum

Using the principle of conservation of momentum, we can set up the equation: (15 kg * 3 m/s) + (10 kg * -5 m/s) = (25 kg * v), where v is the combined velocity after the collision.

## Step 6: Solve for the combined velocity

Plugging in the values, we get: 45 kg*m/s - 50 kg*m/s = 25 kg * v, which simplifies to -5 kg*m/s = 25 kg * v. Solving for v, we get v = -5 kg*m/s / 25 kg = -0.2 m/s.

## Step 7: Interpret the result

The negative sign indicates that the combined velocity is in the direction of the 10 kg object (since we considered its momentum as negative). The magnitude of the velocity is 0.2 m/s.

The final answer is: **0.2!**"

The problem states that when measuring the length of a rod using a perfect slide caliper, the main scale reading is 5mm and the vernier scale reading is 16. The smallest division on the main scale is 0.5mm, and 19 divisions on the main scale are equal to 20 divisions on the vernier scale. We need to find the vernier constant in mm.

## Step 2: Calculate the least count of the vernier scale.
The least count of the vernier scale can be calculated using the formula: Least Count = (Smallest division on the main scale) / (Number of divisions on the main scale equivalent to one less division on the vernier scale). Given that 19 divisions on the main scale are equal to 20 divisions on the vernier scale, the least count is (0.5mm) / (20-19) = 0.5mm / 1 = 0.5mm, but this is not the correct approach for finding the least count in this context. Instead, we should directly use the information about the relationship between the main scale and vernier scale to find the vernier constant.

## Step 3: Calculate the vernier constant.
The vernier constant is the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division. Since 19 main scale divisions equal 20 vernier scale divisions, we can find the length of one vernier scale division. The total length covered by 19 main scale divisions is 19 * 0.5mm = 9.5mm. This length is equal to the length of 20 vernier scale divisions. So, one vernier scale division is 9.5mm / 20 = 0.475mm. The vernier constant (VC) is then the difference between one main scale division (0.5mm) and one vernier scale division (0.475mm). VC = 0.5mm - 0.475mm = 0.025mm.

The problem states: ""At 4 o'clock, what is the angle included between the hour and minute hands of the clock?""

## Step 2: Understand the movement of the clock hands.
At 4 o'clock, the hour hand (short hand) is at the 4, and the minute hand (long hand) is at the 12, i.e., they are two numbers apart.

## Step 3: Calculate the angle moved by the hour hand from the 12 o'clock position.
Since the clock is divided into 12 equal sections, with each section representing 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 = 30 degrees), the hour hand moves 30 degrees for every hour. At 4 o'clock, the hour hand would have moved 4 * 30 = 120 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.

## Step 4: Determine the position of the minute hand.
The minute hand at 4 o'clock is at the 12, which means it is at 0 degrees or the starting point.

## Step 5: Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands.
The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand can be found by subtracting the position of the minute hand from the position of the hour hand. However, since we're looking for the included angle and the hour hand is at 120 degrees, we need to consider the shorter angle between them, which is 360 - 120 = 240 degrees if we consider the full circle. But for the included angle between the two hands, we actually look at the smaller angle formed between them which can be directly calculated as 120 degrees since the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position and does not need further calculation for its position.

The problem states that in a hydraulic press, the smaller piston has an area of 5 square centimeters and the larger piston has an area of 25 square centimeters. When a force of 100 Newtons is applied to the smaller piston, we need to find out how much force will be exerted on the larger piston.

## Step 2: Understand the principle of hydraulic presses.
Hydraulic presses operate on the principle of Pascal's Law, which states that the pressure applied to a fluid in a closed system is transmitted equally in all directions. Since pressure is force per unit area, the force exerted on the larger piston can be calculated using the areas of the pistons and the force applied to the smaller piston.

## Step 3: Calculate the pressure applied to the smaller piston.
The pressure (P) applied to the smaller piston is given by the formula P = F / A, where F is the force applied (100 Newtons) and A is the area of the smaller piston (5 square centimeters). So, P = 100 / 5 = 20 Newtons per square centimeter.

## Step 4: Calculate the force exerted on the larger piston.
Since the pressure is transmitted equally, the same pressure (20 Newtons per square centimeter) is applied to the larger piston. The force (F) exerted on the larger piston can be calculated using the formula F = P * A, where P is the pressure (20 Newtons per square centimeter) and A is the area of the larger piston (25 square centimeters). So, F = 20 * 25 = 500 Newtons.

Newton's second law states that the force (F) applied to an object is equal to the mass (m) of the object multiplied by its acceleration (a). The formula is F = ma.

## Step 3: Use Newton's second law to calculate the acceleration of the object.

Radius = diameter / 2 = 12,800 km / 2 = 6,400 km.

## Step 4: Convert the angle from degrees to radians.
To convert degrees to radians, we multiply by π/180. So, 4 degrees in radians = 4 * (π/180).

## Step 5: Apply the formula to calculate the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong.
Distance = radius * angle in radians = 6,400 km * (4 * π/180).

## Step 6: Perform the calculation.
First, calculate the angle in radians: 4 * (π/180) = 4 * 0.0174532925 ≈ 0.06981357 radians.
Then, calculate the distance: 6,400 km * 0.06981357 ≈ 446.87 km.

The final answer is: **446.87**"

The problem states that when a train passes over a railway line, the temperature difference is 35 degrees Celsius. The thermal expansion coefficient of iron is given as 34.8 x 10^-6 per Kelvin. We need to find out how much the length of a 100-meter long railway line increases in centimeters due to heating.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for linear thermal expansion.
The formula for linear thermal expansion is ΔL = α * L * ΔT, where ΔL is the change in length, α is the thermal expansion coefficient, L is the original length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

## Step 3: Convert the given temperature difference from Celsius to Kelvin.
Since the thermal expansion coefficient is given per Kelvin, we need to convert the temperature difference from Celsius to Kelvin. However, because the change in temperature (ΔT) is the same in both Celsius and Kelvin, we can directly use the 35-degree difference without conversion.

## Step 4: Convert the original length of the railway line from meters to centimeters.
Since we want the final answer in centimeters, we should convert the original length from meters to centimeters. 1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 100 meters = 10,000 centimeters.

## Step 5: Plug in the values into the linear thermal expansion formula.
Using the formula ΔL = α * L * ΔT, we substitute α = 34.8 x 10^-6 per Kelvin, L = 10,000 centimeters (since 100 meters = 10,000 centimeters), and ΔT = 35 Kelvin (temperature difference).

## Step 6: Perform the calculation.
ΔL = 34.8 x 10^-6 * 10,000 * 35 = 34.8 * 10^-6 * 350,000 = 12.18 cm.

The problem translates to: ""At what velocity of an object, the magnitude of its momentum and kinetic energy will be equal?""

## Step 2: Define the equations for momentum and kinetic energy.
Momentum (p) is defined as the product of an object's mass (m) and velocity (v): p = mv.
Kinetic energy (KE) is defined as half the product of an object's mass (m) and the square of its velocity (v): KE = 0.5mv^2.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the condition given in the problem.
We need to find the velocity at which the magnitude of momentum equals the kinetic energy: mv = 0.5mv^2.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for velocity.
First, we can divide both sides of the equation by m (since m cannot be 0 for an object with mass) to simplify: v = 0.5v^2.
Then, we rearrange the equation to set it to 0: 0.5v^2 - v = 0.
Factoring out v: v(0.5v - 1) = 0.
This gives us two possible solutions for v: v = 0 or 0.5v - 1 = 0.
Solving for the second solution: 0.5v = 1, thus v = 2.

## Step 5: Interpret the solutions in the context of the problem.
The solution v = 0 is trivial because an object with zero velocity has neither momentum nor kinetic energy.
The solution v = 2 is the non-trivial solution where the magnitude of momentum and kinetic energy are equal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted and converted into a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. We need to find the radius of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere and a cylinder.
The volume of a sphere (V) is given by the formula V = (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. The volume of a cylinder is given by V = π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius of the base of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the original sphere.
Substitute the given radius of the sphere (r = 6 cm) into the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3) * π * (6)^3.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation for the volume of the sphere.
V = (4/3) * π * 216 = (4/3) * 3.14159 * 216 ≈ 904.7786842338604 cm^3.

## Step 5: Set up the equation for the volume of the resulting cylinder.
Given that the height (h) of the cylinder is 32 cm, the equation for the volume of the cylinder becomes: V = π * r^2 * 32, where r is the radius of the cylinder we are trying to find.

## Step 6: Equate the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder.
Since the volume of the material does not change, set the volume of the sphere equal to the volume of the cylinder: 904.7786842338604 = π * r^2 * 32.

## Step 7: Solve for the radius of the cylinder.
Rearrange the equation to solve for r^2: r^2 = 904.7786842338604 / (π * 32). Then calculate r.

## Step 8: Perform the calculation to find the radius of the cylinder.

The problem states: ""In a right-angled triangle, the perpendicular and base are 3 and 4 respectively. What is the length of the hypotenuse?""

## Step 2: Identify the type of problem and relevant formula
This is a right-angled triangle problem, and we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), i.e., c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem
In this case, the perpendicular (a) is 3 and the base (b) is 4. We can plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem formula to find the length of the hypotenuse (c). So, c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2.

## Step 4: Calculate the length of the hypotenuse
Now, we calculate the values: c^2 = 9 + 16, c^2 = 25. To find c, we take the square root of both sides: c = √25, c = 5.

The problem states that 50 units on the Vernier scale are equal to 49 units on the main scale. It also mentions that the smallest unit on the main scale is 1 mm. We need to find the value of one unit on the Vernier scale in mm.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the Vernier scale and the main scale.
The Vernier scale is a secondary scale that slides along the main scale, allowing for more precise measurements. Since 50 units on the Vernier scale equal 49 units on the main scale, we can determine the value of one Vernier unit relative to the main scale units.

## Step 3: Calculate the value of one Vernier unit in terms of main scale units.
Let's denote the value of one Vernier unit as V and the value of one main scale unit as M. Given that 50V = 49M, we want to find the value of V in mm, knowing that M = 1 mm.

## Step 4: Solve for V.
From the equation 50V = 49M, we substitute M with 1 mm (since 1 unit on the main scale = 1 mm) to find V in mm. Thus, 50V = 49 mm.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of V.
Divide both sides of the equation by 50 to solve for V: V = 49 mm / 50.

## Step 6: Perform the division to find the value of V in mm.
V = 49 mm / 50 = 0.98 mm.

The problem states that 10 grams of sodium hydroxide reacts with 5 grams of carbon dioxide, and we need to find out how many grams of sodium hydroxide will remain after the reaction is complete.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
The reaction between sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide can be represented by the following equation:
2NaOH + CO2 -> Na2CO3 + H2O

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to calculate the number of moles of each reactant.
The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 grams/mole, and the molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 grams/mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.
Number of moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mole = 0.25 mole
Number of moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2 = 5 g / 44 g/mole = 0.114 mole

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio from the balanced equation with the mole ratio of the reactants.
From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of NaOH to CO2 is 2:1. Comparing this with the calculated moles, we have 0.25 mole of NaOH and 0.114 mole of CO2. Since 0.114 mole of CO2 would require 0.228 mole of NaOH (based on the 2:1 ratio), and we have more NaOH than required, CO2 is the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of NaOH that will react with CO2.
Since CO2 is the limiting reactant, all 0.114 mole of CO2 will react. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of CO2 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. Therefore, 0.114 mole of CO2 will react with 0.228 mole of NaOH.

The problem states that an electric motor uses 700 Joules of electric energy to lift a 40 Newton object to a height of 10 meters. We need to find the efficiency of the motor in percentage.

## Step 2: Calculate the work done in lifting the object.
To find the efficiency of the motor, we first need to calculate the work done in lifting the object. The work done (W) can be calculated using the formula W = Force * Distance. Since the force is given as weight (40 N), which is the force due to gravity, and the distance is the height to which the object is lifted (10 m), we can calculate W = 40 N * 10 m = 400 Joules.

## Step 3: Calculate the efficiency of the motor.
The efficiency of the motor can be calculated using the formula Efficiency = (Work done / Energy consumed) * 100. Here, the work done is 400 Joules (from step 2), and the energy consumed is 700 Joules (given in the problem).

## Step 4: Perform the efficiency calculation.
Efficiency = (400 Joules / 700 Joules) * 100.

## Step 5: Calculate the numerical value of the efficiency.
Efficiency = (400 / 700) * 100 = 0.5714 * 100 ≈ 57.14%.

The problem states that the combined measurement using the main scale and vernier scale is 12.66 cm. The vernier constant is to be found given that the vernier scale has a least count of 6 and the main scale reading is 12.6 cm.

## Step 2: Understand the concept of vernier constant and its relation to the least count of the vernier scale.
The vernier constant is the difference between the values of one main scale division and one vernier scale division. It is also equal to the least count of the vernier scale.

## Step 3: Calculate the vernier scale reading.
Since the combined reading is 12.66 cm and the main scale reading is 12.6 cm, the vernier scale reading can be found by subtracting the main scale reading from the combined reading: 12.66 cm - 12.6 cm = 0.06 cm.

## Step 4: Determine the least count of the vernier scale.
Given that the vernier scale has a least count of 6, this implies that the vernier scale can measure up to 1/6th of a division on the main scale. However, to find the vernier constant in mm, we need to consider the relationship between the vernier scale reading and the least count.

## Step 5: Calculate the vernier constant.
The vernier constant (VC) can be calculated using the formula VC = (1 main scale division) / (number of vernier scale divisions). However, since we are given the least count as 6, it means the vernier scale measures 1/6th of a mm (if the main scale division is 1 mm). The vernier constant in this context should directly relate to the precision of the vernier scale, which is given as 6. Since the reading from the vernier scale is 0.06 cm (or 0.6 mm), and considering the least count is related to the vernier scale's precision, we can infer that the vernier constant is directly related to the least count, which is provided as 6. This implies that for every main scale division (1 mm in this context), the vernier scale divides it into parts that allow for a precision of 1/6th of a mm, but the direct calculation of the vernier constant from the given data requires understanding that 0.06 cm (or 0."

## Step 2: Determine the total number of days in July.
July has a total of 31 days.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of days when it did not rain.
Since it rained (either heavily or lightly) for 10 + 15 = 25 days, it did not rain for 31 - 25 = 6 days.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability that it did not rain on July 4th.
The probability of an event happening is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

## Step 5: Calculate the probability.
Given that it did not rain for 6 days out of the 31 days in July, the probability that July 4th was one of those days when it did not rain is the number of days it did not rain divided by the total number of days in July.

The problem states that a circle has a diameter of 20 cm and there is an arc of 50 cm length. We are asked to find the measure of the central angle subtended by this arc in degrees.

## Step 2: Recall the formula to calculate the length of an arc of a circle.
The formula for the length of an arc is given by: arc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius.

## Step 3: Since we are given the diameter, calculate the radius of the circle.
The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so radius = 20 / 2 = 10 cm.

## Step 4: Substitute the given values into the arc length formula to solve for the central angle.
Given arc length = 50 cm, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the central angle: central angle = (arc length * 360) / (2 * π * radius).

## Step 5: Plug in the values for arc length and radius into the formula.
Substituting the given values: central angle = (50 * 360) / (2 * π * 10).

## Step 6: Perform the calculation.
Calculate the central angle: central angle = (50 * 360) / (2 * 3.14159 * 10) = 18000 / (62.8318) ≈ 18000 / 62.8318 ≈ 286.478897.

The problem states that the radius of the Earth is 6440 km. Dhaka and Chittagong form an angle of 5 degrees at the center of the Earth. We need to find the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong.

## Step 2: Recall the formula to calculate the distance between two points on the surface of a sphere (such as the Earth) given the angle at the center.
The formula for the distance (d) between two points on the surface of a sphere is given by d = r * θ, where r is the radius of the sphere and θ is the angle at the center in radians.

## Step 3: Convert the angle from degrees to radians because the formula requires the angle to be in radians.
To convert degrees to radians, we use the formula: radians = degrees * π / 180. So, for a 5-degree angle, the conversion is 5 * π / 180.

## Step 4: Calculate the angle in radians.
Angle in radians = 5 * π / 180 = 5 * 3.14159 / 180 ≈ 0.0872665 radians.

## Step 5: Use the formula from Step 2 to calculate the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong.
Given the Earth's radius (r) is 6440 km, the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong is d = 6440 * 0.0872665.

The problem states that a mountain at a distance of 150 kilometers subtends an angle of 2.50 radians. We need to find the height of the mountain.

## Step 2: Recall the formula to calculate the height of the mountain using the subtended angle and distance.
The formula involves the tangent of the angle, which is tan(angle) = opposite side (height of the mountain) / adjacent side (distance to the mountain).

## Step 3: Convert the given angle from radians to a format that can be used in the tangent function.
Since the angle is already given in radians, we can directly use it in the formula without conversion because the tangent function can handle radians.

## Step 4: Apply the formula to calculate the height of the mountain.
We have tan(2.50 radians) = height / 150 km. To find the height, we rearrange the formula: height = 150 km * tan(2.50 radians).

## Step 5: Calculate the tangent of 2.50 radians.
Using a calculator, tan(2.50 radians) ≈ 14.10 (rounded to two decimal places for the calculation).

## Step 6: Calculate the height of the mountain using the tangent value.
height ≈ 150 km * 14.10 ≈ 2115 km.

## Step 7: Provide the final numerical answer.
Given the nature of the problem, the calculated height seems excessively large, suggesting a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the application of the formula or the interpretation of the tangent value. The correct approach should reconsider the relationship between the angle, distance, and height, focusing on the definition of the tangent function and ensuring all units are appropriately handled.

## Step 8: Re-evaluate the calculation with correct units and formula application.
Given that tan(2.50 radians) is approximately 14.10, the calculation of height = 150 km * tan(2.50 radians) indeed follows the correct formula application but seems to yield an unrealistic result due to the nature of the tangent function's output for large angles. For angles greater than π/2 radians (or 90 degrees), the tangent function increases rapidly. However, in the context of subtended angles and distances, the calculation should reflect a realistic and reasonable outcome.

The problem states that a 0.2 molar solution of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is prepared in 500 milliliters (mL) of solution. We need to find out how many grams of potassium carbonate are present in the solution.

## Step 2: Determine the molar mass of potassium carbonate
To find the mass of potassium carbonate in the solution, we first need to determine its molar mass. The chemical formula for potassium carbonate is K2CO3. The atomic masses are approximately: Potassium (K) = 39.1 g/mol, Carbon (C) = 12.0 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol. The molar mass of K2CO3 = (2 * 39.1) + 12.0 + (3 * 16.0) = 78.2 + 12.0 + 48.0 = 138.2 g/mol.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of potassium carbonate in the solution
Given that the solution is 0.2 molar and we have 500 mL (or 0.5 liters) of the solution, we can calculate the number of moles of K2CO3 present. The formula to find the number of moles from molarity is: moles = molarity * volume (in liters). So, moles = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of potassium carbonate in the solution
Now that we know there are 0.1 moles of K2CO3 in the solution and the molar mass of K2CO3 is 138.2 g/mol, we can find the mass of K2CO3 by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass. Mass = moles * molar mass = 0.1 moles * 138.2 g/mol = 13.82 g.

## Step 2: Calculate the position of the hour hand
At 8:00, the hour hand is at 8 * 30 = 240 degrees (since each hour mark is 30 degrees apart). By 8:20, the hour hand will have moved an additional (20/60) * 30 = 10 degrees. So, the hour hand is at 240 + 10 = 250 degrees.

## Step 3: Calculate the position of the minute hand
At 8:20, the minute hand will be at (20/60) * 360 = 120 degrees (since each minute mark is 6 degrees apart, and there are 360 degrees in a circle).

## Step 4: Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands
To find the angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to find the absolute difference between their positions. The angle between the two hands can be calculated as |250 - 120| = 130 degrees.

## Step 2: Identify the Relevant Formula
To find the amount of gas, we can use the ideal gas law formula: PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is the volume of the gas, n is the amount of gas (in moles), R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature of the gas in Kelvin.

## Step 3: Convert Temperature to Kelvin
The temperature given is in Celsius, so we need to convert it to Kelvin. The conversion formula is T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15. Therefore, T(K) = 40 + 273.15 = 313.15 K.

## Step 4: Rearrange the Ideal Gas Law Formula to Solve for n
To find the amount of gas (n), we rearrange the formula to n = PV / RT.

## Step 5: Plug in the Given Values
Given that P = 27 x 10^3 pascals, V = 0.25 cubic meters, R = 8.314 J/(mol*K), and T = 313.15 K, we can calculate n.

The problem states: ""In the case of a coin toss, what is the probability of the certain event of getting heads or tails?""

## Step 2: Understand the basic principles of probability.
Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, with a range from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

## Step 3: Identify the certain event in the context of a coin toss.
A certain event is one that will always occur. In the case of a coin toss, getting either heads or tails is a certain event because these are the only two possible outcomes, and one of them must happen.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of the certain event.
Since the event of getting heads or tails encompasses all possible outcomes of a coin toss, the probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes (getting heads or tails) divided by the total number of outcomes. In a coin toss, there are 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), and both are favorable for this event. Therefore, the probability is 2/2 or 1.

The problem states that 5 grams of hydrogen gas react with 30 grams of nitrogen gas. We need to find out how many moles of nitrogen will be left over after the reaction.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen to form ammonia.
The reaction between hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2) to form ammonia (NH3) is:
N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3

## Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant by calculating the number of moles of each reactant.
First, calculate the number of moles of hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2) using their molar masses. The molar mass of H2 is 2 g/mol, and the molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol.
Moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molar mass of H2 = 5 g / 2 g/mol = 2.5 mol
Moles of N2 = mass of N2 / molar mass of N2 = 30 g / 28 g/mol = 1.0714 mol

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.
From the chemical equation, 1 mole of N2 reacts with 3 moles of H2. Given the moles calculated, we compare the mole ratio of H2 to N2.
Required moles of H2 for 1.0714 mol of N2 = 1.0714 mol * 3 = 3.2142 mol
Since we only have 2.5 mol of H2, which is less than 3.2142 mol required for all the N2 to react, H2 is the limiting reactant.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of N2 that reacts with the available H2.
Since 3 moles of H2 react with 1 mole of N2, the amount of N2 that reacts with 2.5 mol of H2 is:
Moles of N2 reacted = 2.5 mol / 3 = 0.8333 mol

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of N2 left over after the reaction.
Initial moles of N2 = 1.0714 mol
Moles of N2 reacted = 0.8333 mol

The problem states that there are 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid dissolved in a 500 milliliter solution, and we need to find the density of the solution.

## Step 2: Identify the given values and the unknown value.
Given values: mass of sulfuric acid (m) = 24.5 grams, volume of the solution (V) = 500 milliliters = 0.5 liters.
Unknown value: density of the solution (ρ).

## Step 3: Recall the formula for calculating density.
The formula for density is ρ = m / V, where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of the solution.
To find the density of the solution, we need to know the total mass of the solution, not just the mass of the sulfuric acid. However, since the problem does not provide the mass of the solvent (water), we will assume that the density of the solution can be approximated using the given mass of sulfuric acid and the volume of the solution. This assumption may not be entirely accurate because the density of a solution is typically calculated using the total mass of the solution (solute + solvent). Without the mass of the solvent, we can't accurately calculate the density of the solution. Nonetheless, we'll proceed with the calculation using the provided information for educational purposes.

## Step 5: Convert the volume of the solution to the appropriate unit if necessary.
The volume is given in milliliters and needs to be converted to liters for consistency with the units of mass in grams. 500 milliliters = 0.5 liters.

## Step 6: Calculate the density of the sulfuric acid in the solution.
However, as noted in step 4, without the total mass of the solution (including the solvent), calculating the exact density of the solution is not feasible. The density of sulfuric acid itself can be calculated if we know its volume, but the problem does not provide this information directly.

## Step 7: Realize the limitation of the given information.

## Step 2: Identify the molecular formula of glucose
Glucose has the molecular formula C6H12O6, which means it contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar mass of glucose
To find the percentage of carbon in glucose, we first need to calculate the molar mass of glucose. The atomic masses are approximately: Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol, Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol. The molar mass of glucose is calculated as (6*12.01) + (12*1.008) + (6*16.00).

## Step 4: Perform the molar mass calculation
Molar mass of glucose = (6*12.01) + (12*1.008) + (6*16.00) = 72.06 + 12.096 + 96.00 = 180.156 g/mol.

Perchloric acid is represented by the chemical formula HClO4.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic weights of the elements in perchloric acid.
To calculate the molecular weight of perchloric acid, we need the atomic weights of hydrogen (H), chlorine (Cl), and oxygen (O). The approximate atomic weights are: H = 1 g/mol, Cl = 35.5 g/mol, and O = 16 g/mol.

The problem states that 40 grams of sodium metal and 35.5 grams of chlorine gas are placed in a container. After reacting in a suitable environment to produce sodium chloride, we need to determine how many grams of sodium will be left over.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction
The chemical equation for the reaction between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) to produce sodium chloride (NaCl) is:
2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl

## Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of sodium and chlorine
The molar mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 23 grams/mole, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 71 grams/mole (since atomic mass of Cl is about 35.5 grams/mole).

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant
To find out which reactant is limiting, we need to calculate the number of moles of each reactant.
Moles of Na = mass of Na / molar mass of Na = 40 g / 23 g/mole ≈ 1.74 moles
Moles of Cl2 = mass of Cl2 / molar mass of Cl2 = 35.5 g / 71 g/mole ≈ 0.5 moles

## Step 5: Compare the mole ratio from the equation to the moles of reactants
From the equation, the mole ratio of Na:Cl2 is 2:1. For 0.5 moles of Cl2, we would need 1 mole of Na to fully react (since 2 moles of Na react with 1 mole of Cl2). Since we have more than 1 mole of Na (we have 1.74 moles), Na is in excess, and Cl2 is the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of Na that will react
Since 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 2 moles of Na, 0.5 moles of Cl2 will react with 1 mole of Na.
Mass of Na that will react = 1 mole * 23 g/mole = 23 g

## Step 2: Identify the given information
- Mass of the object (m) = 10 grams = 0.01 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 grams)
- Initial height (h) = 60 meters
- Time (t) = 3 seconds
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s^2 (approximately)

## Step 3: Calculate the velocity of the object after 3 seconds
Since the object is under the sole influence of gravity, we can use the equation for uniformly accelerated motion to find the velocity after 3 seconds. The equation is v = u + gt, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (which is 0, since it's dropped from rest), g is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time.

v = 0 + 9.81 m/s^2 * 3 s = 29.43 m/s

## Step 4: Calculate the momentum of the object
Momentum (p) is calculated using the formula p = mv, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.

p = 0.01 kg * 29.43 m/s = 0.2943 kg-m/s

## Step 5: Convert the momentum to the required units if necessary
The momentum is already in kg-m/s, which matches the units required in the question (kg-m/s is equivalent to kg-kg*m/s^2*s, but since 1 kg = 1 kg, it simplifies to kg-m/s).

The final answer is: **0.2943**"

The problem states that a circle has a diameter of 9 cm. We need to find the central angle subtended by a 15 cm long arc of the circle.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle.
The circumference of a circle is given by C = πd, where d is the diameter of the circle. Here, the diameter is 9 cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the given circle.
Using the formula C = πd, we can calculate the circumference: C = π * 9 = 9π cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the central angle using the arc length formula.
The formula for the arc length is given by L = (θ/360) * 2πr, where L is the arc length, θ is the central angle in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle. Since we are given the diameter (9 cm), the radius r is 9/2 = 4.5 cm. We are also given that the arc length L is 15 cm.

## Step 5: Rearrange the arc length formula to solve for the central angle θ.
Rearranging the formula to solve for θ, we get: θ = (L * 360) / (2πr). Plugging in the values, θ = (15 * 360) / (2 * π * 4.5).

## Step 6: Perform the calculation for the central angle θ.
First, calculate the denominator: 2 * π * 4.5 = 9π. Then, calculate the entire fraction: θ = (15 * 360) / (9π) = 5400 / (9π) = 600 / π.

## Step 7: Convert the central angle from radians to degrees if necessary and calculate the numerical value.
Since the angle is already being calculated in terms of degrees (due to the use of 360 in the formula), no conversion is necessary. However, to find the numerical value, we need to calculate 600 / π.

## Step 8: Calculate the numerical value of the central angle.
θ ≈ 600 / 3.14159 ≈ 191.03 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{191.03}$"

The problem states that Lincoln has a toy box containing toys that represent numbers in the binary number system. Additionally, Lincoln's siblings have 11 more toy boxes. We need to determine the total number of toys they have.

## Step 2: Determine the number of toys in Lincoln's box.
Since the toys in Lincoln's box represent numbers in the binary number system, we can assume that there are toys for each binary digit (0 and 1). However, the problem doesn't explicitly state the range of numbers, so we'll consider the minimum possible representation. In binary, the first few numbers are 0 (which doesn't require a toy), 1 (1 toy), 10 (2 toys), 11 (2 toys), 100 (3 toys), and so on. Without a specific range, we can't accurately calculate the number of toys in Lincoln's box based solely on this information.

## Step 3: Reinterpret the problem for a logical approach.
Given the lack of specificity about the range of binary numbers represented, a more logical interpretation might involve considering a common set of binary numbers or assuming the question implies a basic understanding of binary representation. However, without explicit details on the range or how the toys are distributed among the siblings, we must infer or assume a typical scenario for binary representation, which might not lead to a precise numerical answer based on traditional mathematical logic.

## Step 4: Consider the information about Lincoln's siblings.
The problem mentions that Lincoln's siblings have 11 more toy boxes, but it does not specify what these boxes contain in terms of binary number representations. This information alone does not provide enough detail to calculate the total number of toys without knowing what each box represents or contains.

## Step 5: Recognize the limitation in the problem statement.
The problem lacks specific details necessary for a mathematical calculation, particularly regarding the range of binary numbers represented by the toys in Lincoln's box and the contents of the additional boxes owned by his siblings.

## Step 6: Attempt a logical deduction based on minimal interpretation.
If we were to assume each box, including Lincoln's, contains a minimal representation of binary (e.g., 0 and 1), and considering the siblings have 11 more boxes, we might infer 12 boxes in total (Lincoln's plus the siblings'). However, this assumption does not lead to a meaningful calculation without knowing the specific contents or representations in each box.

The problem asks for the percentage composition of the carbon element in the sodium carbonate compound.

## Step 2: Identify the molecular formula of sodium carbonate.
The molecular formula for sodium carbonate is Na2CO3.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar mass of sodium carbonate.
To find the percentage composition of carbon in sodium carbonate, we first need to calculate the molar mass of Na2CO3. The atomic masses are approximately: Na = 23 g/mol, C = 12 g/mol, and O = 16 g/mol. So, the molar mass of Na2CO3 = (2 * 23) + 12 + (3 * 16) = 46 + 12 + 48 = 106 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of carbon in sodium carbonate.
The mass of carbon in one mole of Na2CO3 is 12 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage composition of carbon in sodium carbonate.
To find the percentage composition of carbon, we use the formula: (mass of carbon in the compound / molar mass of the compound) * 100. So, the percentage composition of carbon = (12 / 106) * 100.

## Step 6: Perform the calculation for the percentage composition of carbon.
Calculating the percentage: (12 / 106) * 100 = 11.32%.

The problem states: ""If Abir participates in a 1000 meter competition at an average speed of 100 m/second and needs to finish the competition 20 seconds earlier to win, what is Abir's chance of winning?""

## Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Abir to complete the 1000 meter competition at his average speed.
To find the time taken, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. Given that the distance is 1000 meters and the speed is 100 m/second, the time taken is 1000 / 100 = 10 seconds.

## Step 3: Determine the time by which Abir needs to finish the competition earlier to win.
According to the problem, Abir needs to finish 20 seconds earlier than his current time to win. However, since his current time to complete the race is 10 seconds, finishing 20 seconds earlier than this time doesn't apply in the conventional sense, as it would imply a negative time. This indicates a misunderstanding in the direct translation of the problem's requirements regarding the time to finish earlier.

## Step 4: Reinterpret the problem's requirement for finishing earlier.
Given that the initial interpretation leads to a logical inconsistency, we should reconsider what ""finishing 20 seconds earlier"" implies in the context of Abir's speed and the race's distance. If Abir's time to complete the race is 10 seconds at 100 m/s, asking him to finish 20 seconds earlier suggests an adjustment in his performance that isn't feasible under normal conditions since his time is already very short.

## Step 5: Realize the need for a more realistic approach to the problem.
Considering the problem might have a typographical error or a misunderstanding in its statement, especially regarding the speed (100 m/s is extremely high for a human runner), let's approach it from a general perspective: If Abir is to win by finishing a certain time earlier, we typically calculate the time difference based on a more realistic speed for human runners, which could range from approximately 20 to 40 km/h (or about 5.5 to 11.1 m/s) for an average person, and much higher for professional runners.

## Step 6: Correctly frame the problem with realistic assumptions.
Given the information and the logical inconsistencies with the provided numbers (100 m/s being unrealistically high for human running), we must assume the problem intends"

The problem states that Russell said he had 77 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave Karim 10000 (in binary) bananas. We need to find out how many bananas Russell had initially in our decimal number system.

## Step 2: Convert the hexadecimal number 77 to decimal.
To convert 77 from hexadecimal to decimal, we use the formula: decimal = (7 * 16^1) + (7 * 16^0). Calculating this, we get decimal = (7 * 16) + (7 * 1) = 112 + 7 = 119.

## Step 3: Convert the binary number 10000 to decimal.
To convert 10000 from binary to decimal, we use the formula: decimal = (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0). Calculating this, we get decimal = (1 * 16) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 16.

## Step 4: Calculate the initial number of bananas Russell had.
Since Russell gave Karim 16 bananas, we need to add this to the number of bananas he had after giving some away, which is not directly stated but we are looking for the initial amount before any were given away. The problem implies Russell had 77 in hexadecimal, which we've converted to decimal as 119. However, the giving away of 10000 in binary (16 in decimal) doesn't directly affect our calculation of the initial amount since we are trying to understand the starting point, not the transaction's impact. Thus, our main goal is to clarify the initial amount based on the given hexadecimal value.

The problem states that a 2 kg object, initially at rest, is dropped from above and covers a distance of 36 meters in 3 seconds. We need to find the fluid friction force exerted on the object during this event.

## Step 2: Identify the forces acting on the object.
The primary forces acting on the object are gravity (pulling it downwards) and fluid friction (opposing the motion). Since the object is dropped, the initial velocity is 0 m/s.

## Step 3: Calculate the acceleration of the object.
To calculate the acceleration, we can use the equation of motion: s = ut + 0.5at^2, where s is the distance traveled (36 m), u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), t is the time taken (3 s), and a is the acceleration. Rearranging the equation to solve for a, we get: a = 2s / t^2.

## Step 4: Calculate the acceleration using the given values.
Substituting the given values, we get: a = 2 * 36 / 3^2 = 72 / 9 = 8 m/s^2.

## Step 5: Calculate the force exerted on the object due to gravity.
The force due to gravity is given by F_g = mg, where m is the mass (2 kg) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2). Therefore, F_g = 2 * 9.8 = 19.6 N.

## Step 6: Calculate the net force acting on the object.
Since the object is accelerating at 8 m/s^2, the net force acting on it is given by F_net = ma, where m is the mass (2 kg) and a is the acceleration (8 m/s^2). Therefore, F_net = 2 * 8 = 16 N.

## Step 7: Calculate the fluid friction force.
The fluid friction force (F_f) is the difference between the force due to gravity (F_g) and the net force (F_net): F_f = F_g - F_net = 19.6 - 16 = 3.6 N.

The problem states that we have a rectangular solid with a length of 12 cm, a width of 9 cm, and a height of 6 cm. We are asked to find the total surface area of this rectangular solid.

## Step 2: Identify the formula for the total surface area of a rectangular solid.
The total surface area (TSA) of a rectangular solid can be calculated using the formula: TSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the solid.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula.
Given that the length (l) is 12 cm, the width (w) is 9 cm, and the height (h) is 6 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula: TSA = 2(12*9) + 2(12*6) + 2(9*6).

## Step 4: Perform the calculations.
First, calculate the area of each pair of faces:
- The area of the two length-width faces is 2 * (12 * 9) = 2 * 108 = 216 square cm.
- The area of the two length-height faces is 2 * (12 * 6) = 2 * 72 = 144 square cm.
- The area of the two width-height faces is 2 * (9 * 6) = 2 * 54 = 108 square cm.
Then, sum these areas to find the total surface area: TSA = 216 + 144 + 108.

The problem states that there is a bag containing 12 blue balls, 16 white balls, and 20 black balls. We need to find the probability that a ball randomly drawn from the bag is not white.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of balls in the bag.
To find the probability, first, we need to calculate the total number of balls in the bag. The total number of balls is the sum of blue, white, and black balls. Total_balls = 12 (blue) + 16 (white) + 20 (black) = 48 balls.

## Step 3: Determine the number of balls that are not white.
Since we are interested in the probability of drawing a ball that is not white, we need to find the total number of non-white balls. Non-white balls include both blue and black balls. Non_white_balls = 12 (blue) + 20 (black) = 32 balls.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing a non-white ball.
The probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing a non-white ball, and the total possible outcomes are the total number of balls. Probability = Non_white_balls / Total_balls = 32 / 48.

## Step 5: Simplify the probability fraction to its simplest form.
To simplify the fraction 32/48, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 32 and 48. The GCD of 32 and 48 is 16. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD. Simplified_probability = (32 / 16) / (48 / 16) = 2 / 3.

The problem states: ""What amount of calcium bicarbonate exists in 2 liters of 0.2 molar calcium bicarbonate solution?""

## Step 2: Understand the given information.
We are given a 0.2 molar solution of calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2) with a volume of 2 liters. The molarity of a solution is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of calcium bicarbonate in the solution.
To find the total number of moles of calcium bicarbonate in 2 liters of a 0.2 molar solution, we multiply the molarity by the volume in liters. moles = molarity * volume = 0.2 mol/L * 2 L = 0.4 mol.

The molar mass of Ca(HCO3)2 can be calculated by adding the atomic masses of calcium (Ca), hydrogen (H), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). The atomic masses are approximately: Ca = 40 g/mol, H = 1 g/mol, C = 12 g/mol, and O = 16 g/mol. So, the molar mass of Ca(HCO3)2 = 40 + 2*(1 + 12 + 3*16) = 40 + 2*(1 + 12 + 48) = 40 + 2*61 = 40 + 122 = 162 g/mol. Now, we can find the mass of calcium bicarbonate by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass: mass = moles * molar mass = 0.4 mol * 162 g/mol = 64.8 g.

The final answer is: **64.8**"

The problem states that a stone is dropped from a tower of 2000 meters height. We need to find out how long it will take for the stone to hit the ground, given the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 10 m/s^2.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant physics formula
The formula to calculate the time it takes for an object to fall under gravity is derived from the equation of motion, which is: s = ut + 0.5gt^2, where s is the displacement (height in this case), u is the initial velocity (0, since it's dropped), t is the time, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula
Given that the initial velocity (u) is 0, the displacement (s) is 2000 meters, and the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 10 m/s^2, we can substitute these values into the formula: 2000 = 0t + 0.5 * 10 * t^2.

## Step 4: Simplify and solve the equation for t
Simplifying the equation gives us: 2000 = 5t^2. To solve for t, we divide both sides by 5, resulting in: t^2 = 2000 / 5 = 400. Then, taking the square root of both sides gives us: t = sqrt(400) = 20.

The problem states that a car accelerates from 36 km/h to 72 km/h in 1 minute. We need to find the distance covered by the car during this time.

## Step 2: Convert the time from minutes to hours
To calculate the distance, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 1 minute = 1/60 hours.

## Step 3: Calculate the acceleration of the car
The acceleration of the car can be calculated using the formula: acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time. Here, the initial velocity is 36 km/h, and the final velocity is 72 km/h. The time is 1/60 hours.

## Step 4: Calculate the acceleration value
Using the formula, acceleration = (72 km/h - 36 km/h) / (1/60 hours) = 36 km/h / (1/60 hours) = 36 * 60 km/h^2 = 2160 km/h^2.

## Step 5: Calculate the average velocity
Since the car is accelerating uniformly, we can use the average velocity to calculate the distance. The average velocity is given by: average velocity = (initial velocity + final velocity) / 2 = (36 km/h + 72 km/h) / 2 = 54 km/h.

## Step 6: Calculate the distance covered
Now, we can calculate the distance covered using the formula: distance = velocity * time. Here, the velocity is the average velocity (54 km/h), and the time is 1/60 hours.

## Step 7: Calculate the distance value
Using the formula, distance = 54 km/h * (1/60 hours) = 54/60 km = 0.9 km.

## Step 8: Convert the distance to meters (optional, but to follow instructions precisely, we'll keep the answer in kilometers as that's the unit used in the problem)
Since 1 km = 1000 meters, the distance in meters would be 0.9 * 1000 = 900 meters. However, for the purpose of this solution and to adhere to the units used in the problem, we'll keep the answer in kilometers.

The problem asks for the complement of a 110-degree angle expressed in radians.

## Step 2: Recall the formula to convert degrees to radians
To convert degrees to radians, we use the formula: radians = degrees * π / 180.

## Step 3: Calculate the complement of the 110-degree angle in degrees
The complement of an angle is 90 degrees minus the angle itself. So, the complement of 110 degrees is 90 - 110 = -20 degrees.

## Step 4: Convert the complement from degrees to radians
Using the formula from step 2, we convert -20 degrees to radians: radians = -20 * π / 180.

## Step 5: Simplify the expression
Simplifying the expression gives us: radians = -π / 9.

## Step 6: Ensure the angle is within the standard range for complements
Since the complement should be a positive value less than 90 degrees (or π/2 radians), and considering the context of the question which seeks the complement in a manner that implies a positive value, we recognize that the calculation directly provides the radian measure but the concept of a complement implies a positive value. The mistake here is interpreting the direct result as the final answer without considering the context of complements in geometry. The correct approach should involve recognizing that the complement of an angle greater than 90 degrees, in the context of this question, seems to be about finding the equivalent positive angle less than 90 degrees that would add up to 90 degrees when combined with the original angle's supplement. However, given the angle is 110 degrees, its supplement is 70 degrees, and thus its complement in the context of adding up to 90 degrees isn't directly applicable as complements are defined for angles less than 90 degrees. The question seems to be asking for the radian equivalent of the angle that, when added to 110 degrees, gives 180 degrees (since 110 degrees is greater than 90, we look at its supplement), which would indeed be the 70 degrees (180 - 110 = 70 degrees), and then converting that to radians.

## Step 7: Correctly calculate the radian measure for the complement relevant to the problem
First, find the supplement of 110 degrees, which is 70 degrees (since 110 + 70 = 180). The complement in the context that makes sense here (considering the standard"

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 36 cm. We need to find the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the sphere
The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the given radius (r = 3 cm) into the formula, we get V = (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cylinder
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the cylinder's base and h is the height of the cylinder. We are given the height (h = 36 cm) but not the radius of the cylinder's base. However, we know that the volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere, since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder. So, we can set up the equation: πr²(36) = 36π.

## Step 4: Solve for the radius of the cylinder's base
Simplifying the equation from Step 3, we get 36πr² = 36π. Dividing both sides by 36π, we get r² = 1. Taking the square root of both sides, we get r = 1 cm (since the radius cannot be negative).

## Step 5: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder
The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh, where r is the radius of the cylinder's base and h is the height of the cylinder. Substituting the values (r = 1 cm and h = 36 cm) into the formula, we get A = 2π(1)(36) = 72π square cm.

## Step 6: Approximate the value of π (if necessary) and calculate the numerical value of the curved surface area
Since the problem does not specify whether to approximate π or leave it in terms of π, and given that the format requests a numerical answer, we will approximate π as 3.14159. However, the problem format suggests providing the answer in a specific form without specifying if π should be approximated. Thus, following"

The problem translates to: ""When an object is thrown vertically upwards at a speed of 19.6 m/s, how high will the object go up to its maximum height?""

## Step 2: Identify the relevant physical principles.
To solve this problem, we use the principle of uniformly accelerated motion under gravity. When an object is thrown vertically upwards, its velocity decreases due to the acceleration caused by gravity until it reaches zero at its maximum height. Then, it starts falling back down.

## Step 3: Apply the formula for maximum height reached by a projectile thrown vertically upwards.
The formula to find the maximum height (h) reached by an object thrown upwards with an initial velocity (v) is given by the equation:

The problem states that a natural number is randomly selected from 10 to 21. We need to find the probability that the selected number is prime.

## Step 2: Identify the prime numbers between 10 and 21.
To determine the probability of selecting a prime number, we first need to identify all prime numbers within the given range (10 to 21). Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

## Step 3: List the numbers between 10 and 21 and identify which are prime.
The numbers between 10 and 21 are: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
Among these, the prime numbers are: 11, 13, 17, 19.

The problem states: ""In a right-angled triangle, the height (perpendicular) and hypotenuse are 5 and 13 respectively. What is the base?""

## Step 2: Recall the Pythagorean theorem
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. This can be expressed as \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\), where \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse, and \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the other two sides.

## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to the given problem
Given that the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is 13 and the height (perpendicular, let's say \(a\)) is 5, we can substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem equation to find the base (\(b\)). The equation becomes \(13^2 = 5^2 + b^2\).

## Step 4: Solve for \(b\)
Calculating the values according to the equation:
\(169 = 25 + b^2\).
Subtract 25 from both sides to isolate \(b^2\):
\(b^2 = 169 - 25\),
\(b^2 = 144\).
Taking the square root of both sides to solve for \(b\):
\(b = \sqrt{144}\),
\(b = 12\).

The problem asks, ""What is the percentage of carbon in carbon dioxide?""

## Step 2: Identify the molecular formula of carbon dioxide.
The molecular formula for carbon dioxide is CO2, which means one molecule of carbon dioxide consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen.
The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12 u (unified atomic mass units), and the atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 u.

## Step 4: Calculate the molecular mass of carbon dioxide.
To find the molecular mass of CO2, we add the mass of one carbon atom to the mass of two oxygen atoms: 12 u (for C) + 2 * 16 u (for O2) = 12 u + 32 u = 44 u.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage of carbon in carbon dioxide.
The percentage of carbon in CO2 can be found by dividing the atomic mass of carbon by the molecular mass of carbon dioxide and then multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage: (12 u / 44 u) * 100.

## Step 6: Perform the calculation.

The problem states that 10.6 grams of soda ash is dissolved in a 100 ml solution, and we need to find the density of the solution.

## Step 2: Identify the given information.
We are given the mass of soda ash (10.6 grams) and the volume of the solution (100 ml). To find the density, we need to know the mass of the solution, not just the mass of the solute (soda ash).

## Step 3: Calculate the mass of the solution.
Since the density of a solution is defined as the mass per unit volume of the solution, we first need to calculate the total mass of the solution. The mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of the solute (soda ash) and the mass of the solvent. However, the problem does not directly give us the mass of the solvent.

## Step 4: Assume the density of the solvent to be approximately that of water.
For simplicity, if we assume the solvent is water (which is a common assumption unless specified otherwise), the mass of 100 ml of water can be calculated using the density of water. The density of water is approximately 1 gram per milliliter (g/ml).

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of the solvent (water).
Mass of water = Volume of water * Density of water = 100 ml * 1 g/ml = 100 grams.

## Step 6: Calculate the total mass of the solution.
Total mass of the solution = Mass of soda ash + Mass of water = 10.6 grams + 100 grams = 110.6 grams.

## Step 7: Calculate the density of the solution.
The density of the solution is the total mass of the solution divided by the total volume of the solution. Density = Total mass / Total volume = 110.6 grams / 100 ml = 1.106 g/ml.

The problem asks for the percentage of ice in a slab of ice that is connected or interlocked.

## Step 2: Understand the context and the concept of interlocked ice.
In the context of ice formation, interlocked ice refers to the percentage of ice crystals that are mechanically connected, which can affect the strength and other physical properties of the ice. However, without a specific formula or further details on the conditions (such as temperature, pressure, or the method of formation), providing a precise numerical answer requires assumptions.

## Step 3: Acknowledge the lack of specific data or formula.
Given the problem statement lacks specific details necessary for calculating the percentage of interlocked ice, such as the type of ice (e.g., sea ice, freshwater ice), the conditions under which it formed, or any relevant physical laws that could apply, a direct calculation cannot be performed.

## Step 4: Consider a general approach to estimating interlocked ice percentage.
In general, the percentage of interlocked ice can depend on various factors including the rate of freezing, the presence of impurities, and the physical conditions during its formation. For instance, slower freezing rates can lead to larger ice crystals, potentially affecting the interlocking percentage. However, without specific numbers or a formula, this step remains conceptual.

## Step 5: Conclude based on the information provided.
Given the lack of specific details or a formula to apply, the problem cannot be solved with the information provided. However, for the sake of following instructions and acknowledging that a typical problem might involve a range of percentages based on the factors mentioned, one might consider that in some contexts, a significant portion of ice could be interlocked, but this is highly speculative without further data.

The problem states that the main scale reading is 12 mm![](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/8/1/7819d53e2af0377b20c7e1619db4e89a6e6c2ec5.png), the vernier constant is 0.10 mm, and the vernier coincidence is 7. We need to find the reading in centimeters.

## Step 2: Understand the vernier scale and its calculation.
The vernier scale is a device used to measure lengths with high precision. It consists of two scales: the main scale and the vernier scale. The main scale has markings at regular intervals, while the vernier scale has markings at smaller intervals. The vernier constant is the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division.

## Step 3: Calculate the least count of the vernier scale.
The least count of the vernier scale is the smallest measurement that can be made using the vernier scale. It is calculated as the main scale division divided by the number of vernier scale divisions. However, in this case, we are given the vernier constant directly, which is 0.10 mm.

## Step 4: Calculate the vernier scale reading.
The vernier scale reading is calculated by multiplying the vernier coincidence (7) by the vernier constant (0.10 mm). This gives us the additional length measured by the vernier scale.

## Step 5: Calculate the total reading in millimeters.
The total reading is the sum of the main scale reading and the vernier scale reading. We need to convert the main scale reading from centimeters to millimeters first, but since it's given as 12 mm![](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/8/1/7819d53e2af0377b20c7e1619db4e89a6e6c2ec5.png), it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the translation.

The problem states that Lincoln has a toy box with toys representing each number in the binary number system. Additionally, Lincoln's siblings have 5 more toy boxes. We need to find out how many toys they have in total.

## Step 2: Determine the number of toys in Lincoln's box.
Since the binary number system includes numbers starting from 0 and going up to infinity, but for practical purposes, we'll consider it starts from 0 and ends at a certain finite number. However, without a specific upper limit, we can consider the first few numbers in binary: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, etc. The binary system is based on powers of 2, but to give a finite answer, we'll need to establish an upper limit. Since the question doesn't specify an upper limit, we might interpret it as asking for the number of toys up to a certain point in the binary system. For simplicity, let's consider the toys representing numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1, where n is the number of bits. Without a specified n, we can't calculate an exact number for Lincoln's box alone.

## Step 3: Establish an upper limit for the binary representation.
To proceed, we need an upper limit. Assuming each box can represent numbers up to 2^3 - 1 (since 2^3 = 8, which gives us 8 different numbers including 0), this would mean each box has toys for 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, which represents 8 toys per box.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of toys including Lincoln's siblings'.
If each box represents 8 toys (from 0 to 7 in binary) and there are a total of 6 boxes (Lincoln's box plus 5 boxes for his siblings), we multiply the number of toys in one box by the total number of boxes. total_toys = 8 * 6.

## Step 5: Perform the multiplication.
total_toys = 8 * 6 = 48.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a diameter of 5 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. We need to find the height of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the original sphere.
The formula to calculate the volume of a sphere is \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. Given the diameter of the sphere is 5 cm, the radius \(r\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\) cm. Substituting the value of \(r\) into the formula, we get \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^3\).

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the sphere numerically.
\(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{125}{8}\right) = \frac{500}{24}\pi = \frac{125}{6}\pi\) cubic cm.

## Step 4: Understand the relationship between the sphere and the cylinder.
When the sphere is melted to form a cylinder, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

## Step 5: Calculate the height of the cylinder using its volume.
Given the radius of the cylinder is 3 cm, we substitute \(r = 3\) cm and \(V = \frac{125}{6}\pi\) into the volume formula for the cylinder: \(\frac{125}{6}\pi = \pi (3)^2 h\).

## Step 6: Solve for \(h\).
Simplifying the equation, we have \(\frac{125}{6}\pi = \pi (9) h\). Dividing both sides by \(9\pi\), we get \(h = \frac{125}{6} \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{125}{54}\).

## Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating the length of an arc of a circle.
The formula to find the length of an arc is given by the product of the radius of the circle and the angle subtended by the arc at the center, when the angle is measured in radians. The formula is: arc length = radius * angle.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 4 cm. We need to find the total surface area of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Find the radius of the sphere
Given that the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, the radius (r) of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 6 / 2 = 3 cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the sphere
The volume (V) of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the value of r, we get V = (4/3) * π * (3)^3 = (4/3) * π * 27 = 36π cubic cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the cylinder
Since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, the volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere, which is 36π cubic cm.

## Step 5: Find the radius of the cylinder
Let the radius of the cylinder be 'R'. The volume (V) of a cylinder is given by the formula V = π * R^2 * h, where h is the height of the cylinder. Given that the height (h) of the cylinder is 4 cm and the volume is 36π cubic cm, we can write the equation as 36π = π * R^2 * 4.

The problem states that a person with a mass of 70 kg climbs a 100-meter high hill in 5 minutes. We need to find the power exerted by the person, given the acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s^2.

## Step 2: Convert the time from minutes to seconds to ensure uniformity of units.
Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, 5 minutes = 5 * 60 = 300 seconds.

## Step 3: Calculate the work done by the person in climbing the hill.
Work done (W) = Force (F) * Distance (d). The force exerted by the person against gravity is equal to their weight, which is given by F = m * g, where m is the mass of the person and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

## Step 4: Compute the force exerted by the person.
Given m = 70 kg and g = 9.8 m/s^2, the force F = 70 * 9.8 = 686 N.

Given 0.25 mol of Mg(NO3)2, using the mole ratio from the reaction, the number of moles of NO2 produced is 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 mol.

## Step 5: Recall the ideal gas law to calculate the volume of nitrogen dioxide produced.
The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

## Step 6: Assume standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions for simplicity.
At STP, P = 1 atm, T = 273.15 K, and R = 0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K).

## Step 7: Rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for volume (V).
V = nRT / P.

## Step 8: Substitute the given values into the equation to calculate the volume of nitrogen dioxide.
V = (0.5 mol) * (0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K)) * (273.15 K) / (1 atm).

## Step 9: Perform the calculation.
V = (0.5) * (0.0821) * (273.15) / (1) = 11.21775 L.

## Step 10: Round the answer to a reasonable number of significant figures.
Rounded to two significant figures, the volume is approximately 11 L.

The problem translates to: ""How many grams of oxygen are required to produce 9 grams of water in a reaction with hydrogen?""

## Step 2: Identify the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water.
The chemical equation for the reaction is 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O. This equation indicates that 2 moles of hydrogen gas react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of water.

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of hydrogen (H2) and water (H2O) to calculate the amount of hydrogen required to produce 9 grams of water.
The molar mass of H2 is approximately 2 g/mol (since hydrogen's atomic mass is about 1 g/mol, and there are two atoms in a molecule of hydrogen gas). The molar mass of H2O is approximately 18 g/mol (2 g/mol for the two hydrogen atoms and 16 g/mol for the oxygen atom).

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of water produced.
Given that 9 grams of water are produced, we can calculate the number of moles of water: moles_of_water = mass_of_water / molar_mass_of_water = 9 g / 18 g/mol = 0.5 mol.

## Step 5: Use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the number of moles of oxygen required.
From the chemical equation 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O, we see that 2 moles of water are produced from 1 mole of oxygen. Since we have 0.5 mol of water, we need half the amount of oxygen that would produce 2 moles of water, which is 0.5 / 2 * 1 = 0.25 mol of oxygen.

## Step 6: Calculate the mass of oxygen required.
The molar mass of O2 is approximately 32 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of oxygen required is: mass_of_oxygen = moles_of_oxygen * molar_mass_of_oxygen = 0.25 mol * 32 g/mol = 8 g.

The problem states that a 5 kg gun fires a 20 gram bullet at a speed of 500 m/s over a period of 0.1 seconds. We need to find the magnitude of the force exerted by the gun on the bullet.

## Step 2: Convert the mass of the bullet to kilograms
To maintain consistent units, we convert the mass of the bullet from grams to kilograms. 20 grams is equal to 0.02 kilograms.

## Step 3: Calculate the change in momentum of the bullet
The change in momentum (Δp) of the bullet can be calculated using the formula Δp = m * Δv, where m is the mass of the bullet and Δv is the change in velocity. Since the bullet is initially at rest, the change in velocity is equal to its final velocity, which is 500 m/s. So, Δp = 0.02 kg * 500 m/s = 10 kg*m/s.

## Step 4: Calculate the force exerted on the bullet using the impulse-momentum theorem
The impulse-momentum theorem states that the force (F) exerted on an object is equal to the change in momentum (Δp) divided by the time (t) over which the force is applied. So, F = Δp / t = 10 kg*m/s / 0.1 s = 100 N.

## Step 5: Consider the recoil of the gun
According to Newton's third law, the force exerted by the gun on the bullet is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the bullet on the gun. However, since we are asked for the force exerted by the gun on the bullet, we do not need to consider the recoil in this calculation.

The problem states that an object of unit mass is thrown upwards with a velocity of 10 m/s. We need to find the height from the ground at which the kinetic energy and potential energy of the object will be equal.

## Step 2: Recall the formulas for kinetic energy and potential energy.
The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.
The potential energy (PE) of an object is given by the formula: PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height of the object above the ground.

## Step 3: Set up the equation for equal kinetic and potential energy.
Since the mass of the object is 1 kg (unit mass), the kinetic energy formula becomes: KE = (1/2)v^2.
The potential energy formula becomes: PE = gh.
We want to find the height (h) at which KE = PE, so we set up the equation: (1/2)v^2 = gh.

## Step 4: Substitute the given initial velocity into the equation and solve for height.
Given that the initial velocity (v) is 10 m/s, we substitute this value into the equation: (1/2)(10)^2 = gh.
This simplifies to: 50 = gh.

## Step 5: Solve for height (h) using the acceleration due to gravity.
Rearranging the equation to solve for h, we get: h = 50 / g.
Substituting the value of g (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), we get: h = 50 / 9.8.

## Step 2: Identify the molecular formula of glucose.
Glucose has the molecular formula C6H12O6, which means one molecule of glucose consists of 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic weights of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
The atomic weights are approximately: Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol, Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of one molecule of glucose.
To find the molecular weight of glucose, we calculate: (6 * 12.01) for carbon + (12 * 1.008) for hydrogen + (6 * 16.00) for oxygen.
This equals: (6 * 12.01) + (12 * 1.008) + (6 * 16.00) = 72.06 + 12.096 + 96.00 = 180.156 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculate the total weight of 10 moles of glucose.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle.
The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
Let's denote the radius of the larger wheel as R and the radius of the smaller wheel as r. The difference in their circumferences is given as 2πR - 2πr = 90 cm.

The problem states that a boy completes 8 laps around a circular path with a radius of 5 meters. We need to find the displacement of the boy.

## Step 2: Calculate the circumference of the circular path
To find the displacement, we first need to calculate the circumference of the circular path. The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2 * π * r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. Given the radius is 5 meters, we can calculate the circumference as C = 2 * π * 5.

## Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by the boy
Since the boy completes 8 laps, the total distance covered by the boy is the circumference of the circular path multiplied by the number of laps. So, the total distance = 8 * C = 8 * (2 * π * 5).

The problem translates to: ""At what temperature is the reading on the Fahrenheit scale twice the reading on the Celsius scale?""

## Step 2: Define the relationship between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales
The relationship between the Fahrenheit (F) and Celsius (C) scales is given by the formula: F = (9/5)C + 32.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given condition
We are told that the reading on the Fahrenheit scale is twice the reading on the Celsius scale. Therefore, we can write the equation: F = 2C.

## Step 4: Substitute the relationship between F and C into the equation
Substituting F = (9/5)C + 32 into the equation F = 2C, we get: (9/5)C + 32 = 2C.

## Step 5: Solve the equation for C
To solve for C, we first multiply the entire equation by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 9C + 160 = 10C. Then, we rearrange the equation to isolate C: 160 = 10C - 9C, which simplifies to 160 = C.

## Step 6: Find the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature
Now that we have the value of C, we can find F using the formula F = (9/5)C + 32. Substituting C = 160 into the formula gives us F = (9/5)*160 + 32.

## Step 7: Calculate the value of F
Performing the calculation: F = (9/5)*160 + 32 = 288 + 32 = 320.

## Step 8: Determine the temperature where F is twice C
However, we need to verify if this step was necessary given the equation F = 2C was our main goal. The actual task is to find the temperature at which F = 2C, and we've already determined C's value but let's correct our approach for clarity and adherence to the problem statement.

## Step 9: Correct approach to solve for C when F = 2C

The problem states: ""At standard temperature and pressure, how many liters of ammonia can be obtained from 4 liters of nitrogen? All reactants and products are in the gaseous state.""

## Step 2: Understanding the Chemical Reaction
The reaction to produce ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) is: N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3. This equation shows that 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to produce 2 moles of ammonia.

## Step 3: Relating Volumes to Moles
At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles. Given that we have 4 liters of nitrogen, we first need to find out how many moles of nitrogen this represents.

## Step 4: Calculating Moles of Nitrogen
To find the number of moles of nitrogen, we use the formula: moles = volume / 22.4. So, moles of N2 = 4 / 22.4.

## Step 5: Calculating Moles of Ammonia Produced
From the chemical equation, 1 mole of N2 produces 2 moles of NH3. Therefore, the moles of NH3 produced = 2 * moles of N2.

## Step 6: Calculating Volume of Ammonia
The volume of ammonia produced can be calculated by multiplying the moles of ammonia by 22.4 (since 1 mole occupies 22.4 liters at STP).

## Step 7: Performing the Calculations
Moles of N2 = 4 / 22.4 = 0.1786 moles.
Moles of NH3 = 2 * 0.1786 = 0.3572 moles.
Volume of NH3 = 0.3572 * 22.4 = 8.0 liters.

The problem asks for the amount of sodium carbonate needed to prepare 250 milliliters of a 0.1 molar solution.

## Step 2: Determine the molar mass of sodium carbonate.
The molar mass of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is calculated as follows: 
- Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of approximately 23 g/mol. Since there are two sodium atoms, their total mass is 2 * 23 = 46 g/mol.
- Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 g/mol. Since there are three oxygen atoms, their total mass is 3 * 16 = 48 g/mol.
Therefore, the molar mass of sodium carbonate is 46 (for Na) + 12 (for C) + 48 (for O) = 106 g/mol.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of sodium carbonate needed for 250 milliliters of a 0.1 molar solution.
First, convert the volume from milliliters to liters because molarity is defined as moles per liter. 250 milliliters = 0.25 liters.
The number of moles needed is calculated by multiplying the volume in liters by the molarity: 0.25 liters * 0.1 moles/liter = 0.025 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of sodium carbonate needed.
To find the mass of sodium carbonate needed, multiply the number of moles required by the molar mass of sodium carbonate: 0.025 moles * 106 g/mol = 2.65 grams.

The problem asks, ""How many grams of magnesium oxide will be produced from 20 grams of magnesium?""

## Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction involved.
The reaction involved is the combustion of magnesium (Mg) in oxygen (O2) to form magnesium oxide (MgO). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:
2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

## Step 3: Calculate the molar mass of magnesium (Mg) and magnesium oxide (MgO).
The atomic mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.305 g/mol.
The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.
Thus, the molar mass of MgO is 24.305 g/mol (for Mg) + 16.00 g/mol (for O) = 40.305 g/mol.

## Step 4: Determine the number of moles of magnesium (Mg) in 20 grams.
Number of moles of Mg = mass of Mg / molar mass of Mg
= 20 g / 24.305 g/mol
≈ 0.822 mol

## Step 5: Use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the number of moles of MgO produced.
From the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO.
So, the number of moles of MgO produced = number of moles of Mg
≈ 0.822 mol

## Step 6: Calculate the mass of MgO produced.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 1 cm. We need to find the height of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the original sphere.
The volume of a sphere (V) is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the given radius of 3 cm into the formula, we get V = (4/3)π(3)³ = (4/3)π(27) = 36π cubic cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the resulting cylinder.
The volume of a cylinder (V) is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. We know that the radius of the cylinder is 1 cm, and we want to find the height. Since the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder, we can set up an equation: 36π = π(1)²h.

The problem states that a 3 kg object is moving east at a speed of 2 m/s, and a 1 kg object is moving west at a speed of 2 m/s. At some point, the two objects collide and merge into one. We need to find the velocity of the merged object.

## Step 2: Determine the initial momentum of each object
To find the velocity of the merged object, we first need to calculate the initial momentum of each object. The momentum of an object is given by the formula: momentum = mass * velocity. For the 3 kg object moving east, the momentum is 3 kg * 2 m/s = 6 kg*m/s (east). For the 1 kg object moving west, the momentum is 1 kg * 2 m/s = 2 kg*m/s (west).

## Step 3: Calculate the total momentum after the collision
Since the objects merge into one after the collision, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum to find the total momentum after the collision. The total momentum is the sum of the initial momenta of the two objects. However, since the 1 kg object is moving in the opposite direction (west), its momentum is considered negative. So, the total momentum is 6 kg*m/s (east) - 2 kg*m/s (west) = 4 kg*m/s (east).

## Step 4: Calculate the velocity of the merged object
The merged object has a total mass of 3 kg + 1 kg = 4 kg. We can use the formula: momentum = mass * velocity to find the velocity of the merged object. Rearranging the formula to solve for velocity, we get: velocity = momentum / mass. Substituting the values, we get: velocity = 4 kg*m/s / 4 kg = 1 m/s (east).

The problem states that a car driver, traveling at a speed of 54 km/h, sees a pedestrian 46 meters away and immediately applies the brake, causing the car to stop 1 meter in front of the pedestrian. We need to find the acceleration of the car.

## Step 2: Convert the initial speed from km/h to m/s
To solve this problem, we first need to convert the initial speed of the car from kilometers per hour to meters per second. We know that 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters and 1 hour equals 3600 seconds. So, the initial speed in meters per second is calculated as follows:
Initial speed (v) = 54 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 15 m/s.

## Step 3: Determine the final speed and distance traveled
When the car stops, its final speed (v') is 0 m/s, since it comes to a complete halt. The distance traveled by the car from the point where the driver applied the brake to where it stopped is 46 - 1 = 45 meters, because it stopped 1 meter in front of the pedestrian.

## Step 4: Apply the equation of motion to find the acceleration
We can use the equation of motion to find the acceleration (a) of the car. The relevant equation is:
v'^2 = v^2 + 2as
where v' is the final speed (0 m/s), v is the initial speed (15 m/s), a is the acceleration, and s is the distance traveled (45 meters). Plugging in the values, we get:
0^2 = 15^2 + 2 * a * 45
0 = 225 + 90a
-225 = 90a
a = -225 / 90

## Step 5: Calculate the acceleration
Now, we calculate the acceleration (a) using the equation derived in the previous step:
a = -225 / 90 = -2.5 m/s^2

The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the initial velocity, which is expected since the car is decelerating.

The problem states that a metal solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. We need to find the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the sphere.
The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the given value, we get V = (4/3)π(6)³ = (4/3)π(216) = 288π cubic cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cylinder.
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. Since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, their volumes are equal. So, we can set up the equation 288π = πr²(32).

## Step 4: Solve for the radius of the cylinder.
Simplifying the equation from Step 3, we get 288π = 32πr². Dividing both sides by 32π, we get r² = 288/32 = 9. Taking the square root of both sides, we get r = √9 = 3 cm.

## Step 5: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder.
The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height. Substituting the values, we get A = 2π(3)(32) = 192π square cm.

## Step 6: Approximate the value of π (if necessary) and calculate the numerical value of the curved surface area.
Since the problem does not specify whether to use an approximation for π or to leave it in terms of π, and given that the format requests a numerical answer, we will use the approximation π ≈ 3.14159 to calculate the curved surface area. A ≈ 192 * 3.14159 ≈ 602.87968 square cm. However, for precision in following the format strictly and since the problem does not explicitly ask for rounding or using π's approximation, we should directly provide the calculation without implying the need for π's approximation in the final step.

The problem states that an object starts moving from a stationary position and reaches a speed of 20 m/s after 5 seconds. We need to find the distance covered by the object in the next 10 seconds.

## Step 2: Understand the motion of the object
Since the object starts from rest and reaches a speed of 20 m/s in 5 seconds, we can assume that the acceleration is constant. We can use the equation of motion to find the acceleration: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration, and t is the time (5 seconds).

## Step 3: Calculate the acceleration of the object
Rearranging the equation v = u + at to solve for acceleration (a), we get: a = (v - u) / t. Substituting the values, we get: a = (20 - 0) / 5 = 4 m/s^2.

## Step 4: Calculate the distance covered in the first 5 seconds
Using the equation s = ut + 0.5at^2, where s is the distance, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), t is the time (5 seconds), and a is the acceleration (4 m/s^2), we can calculate the distance covered in the first 5 seconds: s = 0 * 5 + 0.5 * 4 * 5^2 = 0 + 0.5 * 4 * 25 = 50 meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the distance covered in the next 10 seconds
Since the object has already reached a speed of 20 m/s, it will continue to move at this speed for the next 10 seconds. We can use the equation s = vt to calculate the distance covered: s = 20 * 10 = 200 meters.

Standard conditions are typically defined as 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm (1013 mbar) for gases. However, for ammonia, we also need to know its molar mass to proceed with calculations. The molar mass of ammonia (NH3) is approximately 17.03 g/mol.

## Step 3: Determine the number of moles of ammonia gas.
To find the volume of ammonia gas under standard conditions, we first need to determine how many moles of ammonia we have. This can be calculated using the formula: moles = mass / molar mass. Given that the mass of ammonia is 17 grams and its molar mass is approximately 17.03 g/mol, we can calculate the number of moles.

moles = 17 g / 17.03 g/mol ≈ 1 mol

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of one mole of ammonia gas under standard conditions.
Under standard conditions (0°C and 1 atm), one mole of an ideal gas occupies approximately 22.4 liters. This is known as the molar volume of an ideal gas.

## Step 5: Conclude the volume of 17 grams of ammonia gas.
Since we have approximately 1 mole of ammonia gas, and knowing that 1 mole of any ideal gas at standard conditions occupies about 22.4 liters, we can conclude that the volume of 17 grams of ammonia gas under standard conditions is approximately 22.4 liters.

The final answer is: **22.4**"

The problem states that an object of 1 kg mass is thrown vertically upwards. It falls back to the ground after 10 seconds. We need to find the potential energy of the object at its maximum height.

## Step 2: Identify the given information
- Mass of the object (m) = 1 kg
- Time taken to fall back to the ground (t) = 10 seconds
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s^2 (approximately)

## Step 3: Determine the initial velocity of the object
Since the object is thrown upwards and falls back to the ground after 10 seconds, we can use the equation for the time of flight to find the initial velocity. The time of flight for an object projected upwards is given by t = 2v / g, where v is the initial velocity.

## Step 4: Calculate the initial velocity
Rearrange the equation to solve for v: v = gt / 2 = 9.81 m/s^2 * 10 s / 2 = 49.05 m/s

## Step 5: Calculate the maximum height reached by the object
The maximum height (h) can be found using the equation v^2 = u^2 + 2gh, where u is the initial velocity (which is 0 at the maximum height) and v is the final velocity (which is 0 at the maximum height). However, since we already have the initial velocity and time, we can use the equation h = v^2 / (2g) or consider the upward and downward motion separately.

## Step 6: Calculate the maximum height using the correct approach
Given that the object goes up and comes back down in 10 seconds, and assuming the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the time to reach the maximum height is half of the total time, so t_up = 10 s / 2 = 5 s. The height can then be calculated using h = v0*t - 0.5*g*t^2, but since we are looking for potential energy, we directly calculate it using the initial velocity and mass.

## Step 7: Calculate the potential energy at the maximum height
The potential energy (PE) at the maximum height is given by PE = m * g * h. However, since we know the object's kinetic energy at the point of launch (which converts entirely into potential energy"

The problem states that a coin is tossed 2000 times, and it lands on heads 1030 times. We need to find the probability of the coin landing on tails in a single toss.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of times the coin lands on tails.
Since the coin is tossed 2000 times and lands on heads 1030 times, it lands on tails 2000 - 1030 = 970 times.

## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the coin landing on tails in a single toss.
The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of times the event occurs by the total number of trials. In this case, the probability of the coin landing on tails is 970 (number of tails) divided by 2000 (total number of tosses).

## Step 4: Perform the division to find the probability.
970 / 2000 = 0.485

## Step 5: Since probability is often expressed as a percentage or a fraction, we can simplify the decimal to a fraction if needed. However, in this format, the final answer will be presented as a numerical value without the percentage sign or fraction, as per instructions.

The problem states that Russell said he had 67 (in hexadecimal) bananas. He then took 10000 (in binary) more bananas from Karim. We need to find out how many bananas Russell will have in total, according to our number system (decimal).

## Step 2: Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal
To convert 67 from hexadecimal to decimal, we use the formula: decimal = (6 * 16^1) + (7 * 16^0). Calculating this, we get decimal = (6 * 16) + 7 = 96 + 7 = 103.

## Step 3: Convert the binary number to decimal
To convert 10000 from binary to decimal, we use the formula: decimal = (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0). Calculating this, we get decimal = 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 16.

## Step 4: Add the two decimal numbers
Now, we add the two decimal numbers: 103 (initial bananas) + 16 (bananas taken from Karim) = 119.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a right circular cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. We need to find the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Determine the volume of the original sphere to equate it with the volume of the cylinder.
The volume \(V\) of a sphere with radius \(r\) is given by \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\). Given the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, the radius \(r\) is 3 cm. Thus, the volume of the sphere is \(V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi (3)^3 = 36\pi\).

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cylinder, which will be equal to the volume of the sphere.
The volume \(V\) of a cylinder with radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is given by \(V = \pi r^2h\). Given the radius of the cylinder's base is 3 cm, we need to find the height \(h\) of the cylinder such that its volume equals the sphere's volume. So, \(36\pi = \pi (3)^2h\), which simplifies to \(36\pi = 9\pi h\).

## Step 4: Solve for the height of the cylinder.
Dividing both sides of the equation by \(9\pi\), we get \(h = \frac{36\pi}{9\pi} = 4\). Thus, the height of the cylinder is 4 cm.

## Step 5: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder.
The curved surface area \(A\) of a cylinder is given by \(A = 2\pi rh\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. Substituting the given values, we get \(A = 2\pi (3)(4) = 24\pi\).

## Step 6: Convert the curved surface area into a numerical value.
Since \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14159, the curved surface area is approximately \(24 \times 3.14159 = 75.39816\) square cm. However, for exactness, we keep the answer in terms of \(\pi\) unless specifically asked to approximate.

The problem asks how many grams of oxygen are needed to produce 56 grams of calcium oxide.

## Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction involved.
Calcium oxide (CaO) is produced by the reaction of calcium (Ca) with oxygen (O2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is 2Ca + O2 -> 2CaO.

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of the substances involved.
The molar mass of calcium (Ca) is approximately 40.08 g/mol, and the molar mass of calcium oxide (CaO) is approximately 56.08 g/mol. The molar mass of oxygen (O2) is approximately 32 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of calcium oxide produced.
Given that 56 grams of calcium oxide are produced, we can calculate the number of moles of CaO produced using the formula moles = mass / molar mass. Therefore, moles of CaO = 56 g / 56.08 g/mol ≈ 1 mole.

## Step 5: Use the balanced chemical equation to find the number of moles of oxygen required.
From the balanced equation 2Ca + O2 -> 2CaO, we see that 1 mole of O2 produces 2 moles of CaO. Since we have approximately 1 mole of CaO, we need half the amount of O2, which is 0.5 moles of O2.

## Step 6: Calculate the mass of oxygen required.
Using the molar mass of O2 (approximately 32 g/mol), we can calculate the mass of oxygen needed: mass of O2 = moles of O2 * molar mass of O2 = 0.5 mol * 32 g/mol = 16 g.

The problem states that 5 grams of coke (carbon) and 5 grams of oxygen react to form carbon dioxide. We need to find out how many grams of coke will be left after the reaction is complete.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between carbon (C) and oxygen (O2) to form carbon dioxide (CO2).
The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: 2C + O2 → 2CO2.

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of carbon (C), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) to calculate the number of moles involved.
The molar mass of C is approximately 12 g/mol, the molar mass of O2 is approximately 32 g/mol, and the molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of carbon and oxygen available for the reaction.
Number of moles of C = mass of C / molar mass of C = 5 g / 12 g/mol ≈ 0.4167 mol.
Number of moles of O2 = mass of O2 / molar mass of O2 = 5 g / 32 g/mol ≈ 0.15625 mol.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio from the balanced equation with the available moles.
From the balanced equation, 2 moles of C react with 1 mole of O2. The available mole ratio is approximately 0.4167 mol C to 0.15625 mol O2. To find the limiting reactant, we compare the needed ratio for complete reaction:
- For 0.15625 mol O2, we would need 2 * 0.15625 = 0.3125 mol C for complete reaction, which is less than the available C (0.4167 mol). Thus, O2 is the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of carbon that will react based on the limiting reactant (O2).
Since 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of C, 0.15625 mol of O2 will react with 2 * 0.15625 = 0.3125 mol of C.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of balls in the bag.
To find the probability, we first need to determine the total number of balls in the bag. This can be calculated by adding the number of white, black, and red balls. Total balls = 15 (white) + 10 (black) + 20 (red) = 45 balls.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of white and red balls.
Since we are interested in the probability of drawing a white or red ball, we need to find the total number of white and red balls combined. Total white and red balls = 15 (white) + 20 (red) = 35 balls.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing a white or red ball.
The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are drawing a white or red ball, which we found to be 35. The total number of possible outcomes (total balls) is 45. So, the probability = 35 / 45.

According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O2. Since 0.0823 mol of Mg would require 0.04115 mol of O2 to fully react (which is less than the 0.0625 mol of O2 available), Mg is the limiting reactant in this reaction.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of oxygen that reacted based on the stoichiometry of the reaction and the amount of Mg available.
Since 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O2, 0.0823 mol of Mg will react with 0.0823 / 2 = 0.04115 mol of O2. The mass of O2 that reacted = moles of O2 reacted * molar mass of O2 = 0.04115 mol * 32 g/mol ≈ 1.317 g (rounded to three decimal places for the intermediate calculation).

The final answer is: **1.317**"

The problem states that a 1 kg gun shoots a 5 gram bullet, and as a result, the gun recoils with a velocity of 2 m/s. We need to find the final velocity of the bullet.

## Step 2: Identify the physical principle involved in the problem.
The principle involved here is the conservation of momentum. According to this principle, the total momentum before the event (shooting the bullet) must be equal to the total momentum after the event.

## Step 3: Apply the conservation of momentum principle.
Let's denote the velocity of the bullet as v. The initial momentum of the system (gun + bullet) is zero since both are at rest. After the bullet is shot, the total momentum of the system is the sum of the momentum of the gun and the momentum of the bullet. The momentum of an object is given by the product of its mass and velocity.

## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the conservation of momentum.
The mass of the gun is 1 kg, and its recoil velocity is 2 m/s. The mass of the bullet is 5 grams, which is 0.005 kg. The equation based on the conservation of momentum is: 0 = (mass of gun) * (velocity of gun) + (mass of bullet) * (velocity of bullet). Substituting the given values, we get 0 = 1 kg * (-2 m/s) + 0.005 kg * v.

## Step 5: Solve for the velocity of the bullet.
Rearranging the equation to solve for v, we get: 0.005 kg * v = 2 kg*m/s. Therefore, v = 2 kg*m/s / 0.005 kg = 400 m/s.

The problem states that a car's speed decreases uniformly from 30 m/s to 10 m/s in 5 seconds, and we are asked to find the acceleration of the car in m/s^2.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for uniformly accelerated motion to find acceleration.
The formula to find acceleration (a) when the initial velocity (v_i), final velocity (v_f), and time (t) are given is: a = (v_f - v_i) / t.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula to calculate acceleration.
Given that the initial velocity (v_i) is 30 m/s, the final velocity (v_f) is 10 m/s, and the time (t) is 5 seconds, we can substitute these values into the formula: a = (10 - 30) / 5.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation to find the acceleration.
Calculate the acceleration using the given values: a = (-20) / 5 = -4 m/s^2.

## Step 5: Interpret the result to ensure it matches the question's requirement.
The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the initial velocity, meaning the car is decelerating. The magnitude of the acceleration is what the question asks for.

The problem states that a 75-degree Celsius iron rod is immersed in 150 grams of water at 30 degrees Celsius, resulting in a final temperature of 56 degrees Celsius. The specific heat of water is 4200 J/kg/K, and the specific heat and density of iron are 450 J/kg/K and 7800 kg/m^3, respectively. We need to find the amount of heat absorbed by the water.

## Step 2: Determine the mass of the iron rod.
Since the density of iron is given as 7800 kg/m^3, we need the volume of the iron rod to calculate its mass. However, the volume of the iron rod is not directly provided. We will assume the problem intends for us to use the given information about the final temperature and the specific heats of water and iron to solve for the heat transferred, without explicitly needing the volume or mass of the iron rod for this step.

## Step 3: Calculate the heat lost by the iron rod.
The heat lost by the iron rod can be calculated using the formula Q = mcΔT, where m is the mass, c is the specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature. However, since we don't have the mass of the iron rod directly and are looking to find the heat absorbed by water, we'll consider the heat balance between the iron rod and the water.

## Step 4: Set up the heat balance equation.
The heat lost by the iron rod equals the heat gained by the water. For the iron rod, the initial temperature is 75°C, and the final temperature is 56°C. For the water, the initial temperature is 30°C, and the final temperature is 56°C. The heat balance equation can be written as: m_fe * c_fe * (T_initial_fe - T_final) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water), where m_fe is the mass of the iron, c_fe is the specific heat of iron, T_initial_fe and T_final are the initial and final temperatures of the iron, m_water is the mass of the water, c_water is the specific heat of water, and T_initial_water is the initial temperature of the water.

## Step 5: Solve for the mass of the iron rod using the given information.

The problem states: ""What is the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen atoms?""

## Step 2: Identify the atomic mass of oxygen.
The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16 u (unified atomic mass units), where 1 u = 1.66 x 10^-27 kilograms.

## Step 3: Calculate the mass of one oxygen atom in kilograms.
Mass of one oxygen atom = atomic mass of oxygen * (1 u in kg) = 16 * 1.66 x 10^-27 kg = 2.656 x 10^-26 kg.

## Step 4: Calculate the total mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen atoms.
Total mass = number of atoms * mass of one atom = 6.02 x 10^23 * 2.656 x 10^-26 kg.

## Step 5: Perform the multiplication.
Total mass = 6.02 x 10^23 * 2.656 x 10^-26 kg = 16.00512 x 10^-3 kg.

The problem states that a spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half-submerged in water and is floating. We need to find the buoyancy of the sphere.

## Step 2: Recall the principle of buoyancy.
The principle of buoyancy states that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid the body displaces.

## Step 3: Calculate the weight of the water displaced by the sphere when it is half-submerged.
Since the sphere is half-submerged, it displaces a volume of water equal to half the volume of the sphere. The volume of the sphere is 200 cubic meters, so the volume of water displaced is 200 / 2 = 100 cubic meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the weight of the water displaced.
The weight of the water displaced is equal to the volume of water displaced multiplied by the density of water. The density of water is approximately 1000 kilograms per cubic meter. So, the weight of the water displaced is 100 cubic meters * 1000 kilograms/cubic meter = 100,000 kilograms or 1000 kilograms-force (since 1 kilogram-force = 1 kilogram * 1 g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.8 m/s^2, but for simplicity and because the problem does not specify, we consider the density in terms of mass for calculations directly applicable to force).

## Step 5: Relate the weight of the water displaced to the buoyancy of the sphere.
The buoyancy (or buoyant force) exerted on the sphere is equal to the weight of the water displaced. This is based on Archimedes' principle.

## Step 6: Calculate the buoyancy of the sphere.
Given that the sphere displaces 100 cubic meters of water when half-submerged, the buoyancy is directly equal to the weight of this volume of water, which we've determined to be 1000 kilograms-force (considering the simplification that 1 kg of mass equals 1 kg-force under Earth's gravity for this problem context).

The problem asks, ""How many grams of sodium hydroxide are dissolved in 200 milliliters of solution so that its concentration is semi-molar?""

## Step 2: Understand the concept of semi-molar concentration
A semi-molar solution is a solution with a concentration of 0.5 moles of solute per liter of solution. Since we are dealing with 200 milliliters (which is 0.2 liters), we need to calculate the amount of sodium hydroxide required to achieve this concentration in the given volume.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide needed for a semi-molar solution in 0.2 liters
For a semi-molar solution, the concentration is 0.5 moles per liter. So, in 0.2 liters, the number of moles needed is 0.5 moles/liter * 0.2 liters = 0.1 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the molar mass of sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
The molar mass of sodium hydroxide is approximately 40 grams per mole (Na = 23 g/mol, O = 16 g/mol, H = 1 g/mol, so NaOH = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol).

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of sodium hydroxide needed

The problem states that based on the principle of ball amplification, a hydraulic press is established where the diameter of the larger piston is 8 times that of the smaller piston. We need to find out how many times more force will be felt on the larger piston.

## Step 2: Recall the principle of hydraulic press.
The principle of a hydraulic press is based on Pascal's law, which states that the pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in every direction and acts with equal force on equal areas and at right angles to a container's walls.

## Step 3: Understand the relationship between force, pressure, and area.
The force (F) exerted on a piston is equal to the pressure (P) multiplied by the area (A) of the piston, given by the formula F = P * A. Since pressure is the same in both pistons (as per Pascal's law), the ratio of forces will be directly proportional to the ratio of areas.

## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of areas between the larger and smaller pistons.
Given that the diameter of the larger piston is 8 times that of the smaller piston, the radius of the larger piston is also 8 times that of the smaller piston. The area of a circle (such as the piston) is given by A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Thus, the area of the larger piston is (8r)^2 = 64r^2, compared to the area of the smaller piston which is r^2. This means the area of the larger piston is 64 times the area of the smaller piston.

## Step 5: Determine the ratio of forces on the larger piston compared to the smaller piston.
Since the pressure is constant and the area of the larger piston is 64 times that of the smaller piston, the force exerted on the larger piston will be 64 times the force exerted on the smaller piston.

## Step 2: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students who like at least one sport.
The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for two sets A and B, the size of the union of A and B is equal to the size of A plus the size of B minus the size of their intersection. In this case, the size of the set of students who like cricket (A) is 60, the size of the set of students who like football (B) is 40, and the size of their intersection (students who like both) is 25.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of students who like at least one sport using the inclusion-exclusion principle.
Total students who like at least one sport = (Number of students who like cricket) + (Number of students who like football) - (Number of students who like both sports) = 60 + 40 - 25 = 75.

Let's denote the larger angle as L and the smaller angle as S.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
We have two equations: L + S = 60 (the sum of the angles is 60 degrees) and L - S = 30 (the difference between the angles is 30 degrees).

We can solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute into the other. Let's solve the second equation for L: L = S + 30.

Substituting L = S + 30 into the equation L + S = 60 gives us (S + 30) + S = 60.

## Step 6: Simplify and solve for S.
Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 60. Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2S = 30. Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 15.

Oxygen molecule is represented as O2, meaning one molecule of oxygen contains 2 oxygen atoms. Water molecule is represented as H2O, meaning one molecule of water contains 1 oxygen atom.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of oxygen molecules.
One mole of any substance contains 6.022 x 10^23 molecules (Avogadro's number). Since one oxygen molecule (O2) contains 2 oxygen atoms, one mole of oxygen molecules contains 2 * 6.022 x 10^23 oxygen atoms.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of water molecules.
Similarly, one mole of water (H2O) contains 6.022 x 10^23 molecules. Since one water molecule contains 1 oxygen atom, one mole of water molecules contains 1 * 6.022 x 10^23 oxygen atoms.

## Step 5: Determine how many times the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of oxygen molecules is compared to one mole of water molecules.
To find this, we divide the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of oxygen by the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of water: (2 * 6.022 x 10^23) / (1 * 6.022 x 10^23).

## Step 6: Simplify the calculation.
The calculation simplifies to 2, since the Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23) cancels out. This means that the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of oxygen molecules is twice the number of oxygen atoms in one mole of water molecules.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the sphere
The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Given that the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 3 cm. So, the volume of the sphere is V = (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic cm.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. We know that the height of the cylinder is 4 cm. Since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder. So, we can set up the equation 36π = πr²(4).

When a small rod is placed between the jaws, it is observed that the zero mark on the Vernier scale crosses the 5.2 cm mark on the main scale. Furthermore, the 14th mark on the Vernier scale coincides with a mark on the main scale.

## Step 2: Determine the least count of the Vernier scale.
The least count of the Vernier scale can be calculated using the formula: Least count = 1 main scale division / number of Vernier scale divisions.

Given that the Vernier scale's zero mark crosses the 5.2 cm mark, we understand that the rod's length is slightly more than 5.2 cm because the Vernier zero is beyond the 5.2 cm mark on the main scale.

## Step 5: Calculate the additional length beyond 5.2 cm.
To find the additional length, we use the fact that the 14th mark on the Vernier scale coincides with a mark on the main scale. Since the least count of the Vernier scale is 1/20 of a main scale division, each Vernier scale division is 1/20 of a main scale division. The 14th mark means 14 * (1/20) = 14/20 = 0.7 of a main scale division is added to the 5.2 cm.

## Step 6: Determine the value of one main scale division to calculate the additional length.

The problem states that a 0.125 molar solution of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is prepared in 750 milliliters. We need to find out how many grams of potassium carbonate are present in the solution.

## Step 2: Determine the molar mass of potassium carbonate.
To find the mass of potassium carbonate in the solution, we first need to calculate its molar mass. The chemical formula for potassium carbonate is K2CO3. The atomic masses are approximately: Potassium (K) = 39.1 g/mol, Carbon (C) = 12.0 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol. The molar mass of K2CO3 = (2 * 39.1) + 12.0 + (3 * 16.0) = 78.2 + 12.0 + 48.0 = 138.2 g/mol.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of potassium carbonate in the solution.
Given that the solution is 0.125 molar and we have 750 milliliters (or 0.75 liters, since 1 liter = 1000 milliliters), we can calculate the number of moles of potassium carbonate. The formula to find the number of moles from molarity is: moles = molarity * volume (in liters). So, moles = 0.125 M * 0.75 L = 0.09375 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of potassium carbonate in the solution.
To find the mass of potassium carbonate, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass of potassium carbonate. Mass = moles * molar mass = 0.09375 moles * 138.2 g/mol.

## Step 5: Perform the final calculation.
Mass = 0.09375 * 138.2 = 12.96 grams (approximately).

The problem asks for the percentage of oxygen in magnesium nitrate.

## Step 2: Understanding the chemical formula of magnesium nitrate
Magnesium nitrate is chemically represented as Mg(NO3)2, which means one magnesium atom is combined with two nitrate ions (NO3).

## Step 3: Calculating the molar mass of magnesium nitrate
To find the percentage of oxygen, we first need to calculate the molar mass of Mg(NO3)2.
- The atomic mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.305 g/mol.
- The atomic mass of nitrogen (N) is approximately 14.007 g/mol.
- The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 15.999 g/mol.
The molar mass of Mg(NO3)2 = 24.305 (Mg) + 2*[14.007 (N) + 3*15.999 (O)].
This simplifies to 24.305 + 2*(14.007 + 47.997) = 24.305 + 2*62.004 = 24.305 + 124.008 = 148.313 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculating the mass of oxygen in magnesium nitrate
Since there are 6 oxygen atoms in Mg(NO3)2, the total mass of oxygen = 6 * 15.999 g/mol = 95.994 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculating the percentage of oxygen in magnesium nitrate
The percentage of oxygen = (mass of oxygen in the compound / molar mass of the compound) * 100.
So, the percentage of oxygen = (95.994 / 148.313) * 100.

## Step 6: Performing the calculation
Percentage of oxygen = (95.994 / 148.313) * 100 ≈ 64.67%.

The problem states: ""The main scale reading is 14 mm, the vernier constant is 0.1 mm, and the vernier scale reading is 3. What is the total reading in mm?""

## Step 2: Understand the concept of vernier scale and its calculation.
The vernier scale is a device used to measure small increments with greater precision. The total reading is calculated by adding the main scale reading to the vernier scale reading multiplied by the vernier constant.

## Step 3: Calculate the vernier scale contribution.
The vernier scale reading is 3, and the vernier constant is 0.1 mm. So, the contribution of the vernier scale to the total reading is 3 * 0.1 = 0.3 mm.

## Step 4: Calculate the total reading.
The main scale reading is 14 mm. Adding the vernier scale contribution to this gives the total reading: 14 + 0.3 = 14.3 mm.

However, to provide a more accurate translation considering the context of molecular weight and moles, it should be: ""Ethene has a molecular weight, what is the total weight of 7 moles of Ethene?""

## Step 2: Identify the molecular formula of Ethene.
Ethene, also known as Ethylene, has the molecular formula C2H4, which means each molecule consists of 2 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic weights of Carbon and Hydrogen.
The atomic weight of Carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol, and the atomic weight of Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of Ethene.
To find the molecular weight of Ethene (C2H4), we need to sum the atomic weights of its constituent atoms:
- For Carbon: 2 * 12.01 g/mol = 24.02 g/mol
- For Hydrogen: 4 * 1.008 g/mol = 4.032 g/mol
So, the molecular weight of Ethene = 24.02 g/mol + 4.032 g/mol = 28.052 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculate the total weight of 7 moles of Ethene.
To find the total weight of 7 moles of Ethene, we multiply the molecular weight of Ethene by the number of moles:
Total weight = Molecular weight of Ethene * Number of moles
Total weight = 28.052 g/mol * 7 mol = 196.364 g

The problem states: ""এক মিনিটে একটি দেওয়াল ঘড়ির সেকেন্ড কাঁটার সরণ কত মিটার?"", which translates to ""How much distance does the second hand of a wall clock cover in one minute?""

## Step 2: Understand the motion of the second hand of a clock.
The second hand of a clock moves in a circular motion, making a complete rotation every minute. This means it covers the entire circumference of the circle (or the clock face) in 60 seconds.

## Step 3: Determine the circumference of the clock face.
To find the distance covered by the second hand, we need to know the circumference of the clock face. However, the problem does not provide the radius or diameter of the clock. For a standard clock, let's assume a typical diameter, but since the problem does not specify, we'll use the general formula for circumference, which is C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the clock face.

## Step 4: Realize the problem's assumption or missing information.
Since the problem does not provide the specific diameter or radius of the clock and asks for the distance in meters, we must recognize that the question seems to imply a standard or typical clock size. However, clocks can vary greatly in size, from small wristwatches to large wall clocks. Without a specified radius or diameter, we cannot calculate an exact distance.

## Step 5: Consider a general approach to solve the problem with assumed values.
Given the lack of specificity, let's consider a hypothetical clock with a radius. For example, if we assume a clock with a radius of 10 cm (0.1 meters), the circumference would be C = 2 * π * 0.1 meters. Calculating this gives C = 2 * 3.14159 * 0.1 = 0.628318 meters. This is the distance the second hand would travel in one complete rotation.

## Step 6: Apply the given condition to find the solution.
Since the second hand makes one complete rotation every minute, the distance it travels in one minute is equal to the circumference of the clock face. Thus, for our assumed clock size, the second hand travels approximately 0"

Given parameters: mass (m) = 2 kg, initial velocity (v_i) = 5 m/s, final velocity (v_f) = 8 m/s, time (t) = 3 seconds. The unknown quantity is the force (F) applied to the object.

## Step 3: Recall Newton's second law of motion and the equation for force.
Newton's second law states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). Acceleration (a) can be calculated using the formula a = Δv / Δt, where Δv is the change in velocity and Δt is the change in time.

## Step 4: Calculate the change in velocity (Δv).
Δv = v_f - v_i = 8 m/s - 5 m/s = 3 m/s.

The reaction between sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented by the equation:
Na2CO3 + 2HCl -> 2NaCl + CO2 + H2O

## Step 3: Determine the number of moles of sodium carbonate
Given that the volume of sodium carbonate solution is 10 ml and its molarity is 0.2 M, we can calculate the number of moles of sodium carbonate:
Number of moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.2 M * (10 ml / 1000) = 0.2 * 0.01 = 0.002 moles

## Step 4: Determine the number of moles of hydrochloric acid required
From the chemical equation, we see that 1 mole of sodium carbonate reacts with 2 moles of hydrochloric acid. Therefore, the number of moles of hydrochloric acid required is:
Number of moles of HCl = 2 * Number of moles of Na2CO3 = 2 * 0.002 = 0.004 moles

## Step 5: Calculate the volume of decimolar hydrochloric acid required
Since the hydrochloric acid is decimolar (0.1 M), we can calculate the volume required:
Volume = Number of moles / Molarity = 0.004 moles / 0.1 M = 0.04 liters = 40 ml

## Step 6: Calculate the mass of hydrochloric acid required
The molar mass of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is approximately 36.46 g/mol. Since we have 0.004 moles of HCl, the mass required is:

## Step 2: Understand the principle of flotation.
According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyancy force (or upthrust) on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. For an object to float, it must displace a volume of fluid that weighs at least as much as the object itself.

## Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the densities of wood and water.
The density of wood is 0.40 x 10^3 kg/m^3, and the density of water is 1 x 10^3 kg/m^3. The ratio of the density of wood to the density of water is 0.40 / 1 = 0.4.

## Step 4: Determine the percentage of the wood that will be submerged.
Since the wood will displace a volume of water that weighs the same as the wood, and the density of the wood is 0.4 times that of water, the volume of water displaced by the wood will be 0.4 times the volume of the wood. This means 40% of the wood's volume will be submerged to displace water that weighs the same as the wood, allowing it to float.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen.
The reaction between hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2) produces ammonia (NH3). The balanced chemical equation is: N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3.

To find the limiting reactant, we need to calculate the number of moles of each reactant. The molar mass of H2 is 2 g/mol, and the molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol. The number of moles of H2 is 5 g / 2 g/mol = 2.5 mol. The number of moles of N2 is 30 g / 28 g/mol = 1.07 mol. From the balanced equation, 1 mole of N2 reacts with 3 moles of H2. Since 1.07 mol of N2 would require 3.21 mol of H2 to fully react (which is more than the 2.5 mol of H2 available), H2 is the limiting reactant.

Since H2 is the limiting reactant, we use the number of moles of H2 to calculate the mass of ammonia (NH3) produced. The molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol. From the balanced equation, 3 moles of H2 produce 2 moles of NH3. So, 2.5 mol of H2 will produce (2/3) * 2.5 = 1.67 mol of NH3. The mass of NH3 produced is 1.67 mol * 17 g/mol = 28.39 g.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of N2 left over.
Since N2 is in excess, some of it will be left over after the reaction. The number of moles of N2 that react with 2.5 mol of H2 is (1/3) * 2.5 = 0.83 mol (since 3 moles of H2 react with 1 mole of N2). The mass of N2 that reacts is 0.83 mol * 28"

The problem states: ""If one-fourth of the circumference of a circular path with a radius of 10 meters is covered, what will be the displacement in meters?""

## Step 2: Calculate the circumference of the circular path
The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by C = 2 * π * r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle. Substituting the given value of r = 10 meters into the formula, we get C = 2 * π * 10 = 20 * π meters.

## Step 3: Calculate one-fourth of the circumference
To find one-fourth of the circumference, we multiply the circumference by 1/4. So, one-fourth of the circumference = (1/4) * 20 * π = 5 * π meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the displacement
Since the displacement is equal to the distance traveled along the circular path, which in this case is one-fourth of the circumference, the displacement is 5 * π meters.

## Step 5: Approximate the value of π
The value of π is approximately 3.14159. We can use this approximation to calculate the numerical value of the displacement.

## Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the displacement
Substituting the value of π into the expression for displacement, we get displacement = 5 * 3.14159 ≈ 15.70795 meters.

The problem states that 10 grams of sodium hydroxide reacts with 5 grams of carbon dioxide to form a salt, and we need to determine the amount of salt produced.

## Step 2: Write the chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.
The reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be represented by the following chemical equation:
NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O

However, the correct balanced equation considering the formation of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) from sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide should actually be:
2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O

## Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.
The molar mass of NaOH = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol.
The molar mass of CO2 = 12 (C) + 2*16 (O) = 44 g/mol.

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant.
To find the limiting reactant, we calculate the number of moles of each reactant.
Moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol.
Moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2 = 5 g / 44 g/mol ≈ 0.114 mol.

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the moles of CO2 required to react with 0.25 mol of NaOH would be 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 mol. Since we have less than 0.125 mol of CO2 (approximately 0.114 mol), CO2 is the limiting reactant.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of sodium carbonate produced.
Since 1 mole of CO2 produces 1 mole of Na2CO3, and we have approximately 0.114 mol of CO2:
Moles of Na2CO3 produced = moles of CO2 = 0.114 mol.

The molar mass of Na2CO3 = 2*23 (Na) + 12 (C) + 3*16 ("

Glucose has the molecular formula C6H12O6, which means one molecule of glucose consists of 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic weights of the elements in glucose
The atomic weights are approximately: Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol, Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of one mole of glucose
To find the molecular weight of glucose, we sum the atomic weights of all the atoms in one molecule:
Molecular weight = (6 * 12.01) + (12 * 1.008) + (6 * 16.00)
Molecular weight = 72.06 + 12.096 + 96.00

The problem states: ""If the number of elements in a set is 5, then the number of its proper subsets is?""

## Step 2: Understand what a proper subset is.
A proper subset is a subset that is not equal to the set itself. For example, if we have a set {a, b, c}, then its proper subsets are {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of proper subsets for a set with 5 elements.
The formula to calculate the total number of subsets (including the empty set and the set itself) is 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. Since we are interested in proper subsets, we subtract 1 from this total to exclude the set itself. However, we must also consider the empty set, which is a subset of every set but not a proper subset in the context of excluding both the empty set and the set itself. The correct approach is to use the formula 2^n - 1, understanding that this subtraction removes the set itself, and recognizing that the empty set is indeed a proper subset in the general definition.

## Step 4: Apply the formula with n = 5.
Using the formula 2^n - 1, where n = 5, we calculate the number of proper subsets as 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31.

The problem states that a spherical ball with a radius of 4 cm fits perfectly inside a cylindrical box. We need to find the volume of the cylinder.

## Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the cylinder
Since the spherical ball fits perfectly inside the cylinder, the diameter of the ball is equal to the diameter of the cylinder's base. The diameter of the ball is twice its radius, which is 2 * 4 = 8 cm. Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder's base is also 8 cm, making its radius 4 cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the height of the cylinder
The height of the cylinder is equal to the diameter of the ball, as the ball touches the top and bottom of the cylinder. So, the height of the cylinder is also 8 cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the cylinder
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Plugging in the values, V = π * (4)^2 * 8 = π * 16 * 8 = 128π ≈ 402.12 cubic cm. However, for precision and following the format which implies a numerical answer without specifying if it should be an approximation or exact, we'll keep the formulaic representation which directly gives the exact volume as 128π cubic cm, but since the format demands a numerical answer, we calculate it directly.
