""I have a large chocolate. I cut the chocolate into 8 equal pieces. I gave 3 pieces to my sister, 2 pieces to my brother, and I ate the rest myself. I want to know what fraction of the chocolate I ate.""

Now, let's calculate the fraction of the chocolate that I ate. 
Since the chocolate was cut into 8 equal pieces, and I gave away 3 + 2 = 5 pieces, I ate 8 - 5 = 3 pieces.

To find the fraction of the chocolate I ate, we divide the number of pieces I ate by the total number of pieces.
Fraction = (Number of pieces I ate) / (Total number of pieces) = 3/8.

Therefore, I ate 3/8 of the chocolate.

""The one integer is double the other, and their sum is 96. Find the larger integer.""

Let's denote the smaller integer as x. According to the problem, the larger integer is double the smaller one, so it is 2x. The sum of these two integers is given as 96. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x = 96

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 96

Dividing both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 96 / 3
x = 32

Since the larger integer is 2x, we substitute the value of x into this equation:

Larger integer = 2 * 32
Larger integer = 64

Therefore, the larger integer is 64.

""From 651201, what is the smallest number that when subtracted, the difference will be a perfect square?""

Now, to find the solution, we need to consider perfect squares close to 651201 and determine which one, when subtracted from 651201, yields the smallest possible positive difference.

First, let's find the closest perfect square to 651201. 

To do this efficiently, we can start by finding the square root of 651201. The square root of 651201 is approximately 807.35.

The closest perfect squares would be 806^2 and 807^2.

806^2 = 649636, and 
807^2 = 652089.

Since we are looking for the smallest number to subtract from 651201 to get a perfect square, we should consider the closest lower perfect square, which is 806^2 = 649636.

The difference between 651201 and 649636 is 651201 - 649636 = 1565.

Therefore, the smallest number that can be subtracted from 651201 to get a perfect square (649636) is 1565.

""Find the smaller number whose sum with another is 147 and is 4 more than 0.375 times the other.""

Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. We have two equations based on the given conditions:

1. The sum of the two numbers is 147: x + y = 147
2. The smaller number is 4 more than 0.375 times the larger number: x = 0.375y + 4

We can solve these equations to find the values of x and y.

First, substitute the expression for x from the second equation into the first equation:

0.375y + 4 + y = 147

Combine like terms:

1.375y + 4 = 147

Subtract 4 from both sides:

1.375y = 143

Divide both sides by 1.375:

y = 143 / 1.375
y = 104

Now that we have y, we can find x using the equation x + y = 147:

x + 104 = 147

Subtract 104 from both sides:

x = 43

Therefore, the smaller number is 43.

Calculate the minimum number of saplings sent by the panchayat.""

Now, let's solve the problem. We are looking for the smallest number that is divisible by 20, 24, and 30, since the saplings can be evenly distributed in rows of these lengths.

To find this number, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 24, and 30.

- The prime factorization of 20 is: 2^2 * 5
- The prime factorization of 24 is: 2^3 * 3
- The prime factorization of 30 is: 2 * 3 * 5

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^3 (from 24)
- The highest power of 3 is 3 (from 24 and 30)
- The highest power of 5 is 5 (from 20 and 30)

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.

First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors or use the Euclidean algorithm directly:

1. Start with the two numbers: 9786 and 2796.
2. Divide the larger number by the smaller one: 9786 ÷ 2796 = 3 remainder 1098.
3. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder: 2796 and 1098.
4. Continue the process: 2796 ÷ 1098 = 2 remainder 600.
5. Continue: 1098 ÷ 600 = 1 remainder 498.
6. Continue: 600 ÷ 498 = 1 remainder 102.
7. Continue: 498 ÷ 102 = 4 remainder 90.
8. Continue: 102 ÷ 90 = 1 remainder 12.
9. Continue: 90 ÷ 12 = 7 remainder 6.
10. Continue: 12 ÷ 6 = 2 remainder 0.

When the remainder becomes 0, the divisor at this step is the GCD. Therefore, the GCD of 9786 and 2796 is 6.

The problem states there are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 kurtas (or jamas). 

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The problem is asking how many dhotis each family will receive if 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 kurtas are distributed evenly among some families.""

Now, to solve the problem:
We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1071, 595, and 357 to know how many families can receive an equal share of each item.

Calculating the GCD:
- The prime factorization of 1071 is 3 * 7 * 17 * 3.
- The prime factorization of 595 is 5 * 7 * 17.
- The prime factorization of 357 is 3 * 7 * 17.

The common factors are 7 and 17, and one 3 is common among them but since 595 does not have 3, we only consider 7 and 17 for GCD.
So, GCD = 7 * 17 = 119.

This means that the items can be evenly distributed among 119 families.

Now, to find out how many dhotis each family will get:
Total dhotis / Total families = 1071 / 119 = 9.

Therefore, each family will get 9 dhotis.

Now, let's denote the number of apple seeds Faiaz had as F and the number of apple seeds Ayaz had as A.

From the first statement, we can write the equation:
A + 10 = 3(F - 10)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
A + 10 = 3F - 30
A = 3F - 40

From the second statement, we can write the equation:
F + 20 = 2(A - 20)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
F + 20 = 2A - 40
F = 2A - 60

Now, we can substitute the expression for F from the second equation into the first equation:
A = 3(2A - 60) - 40
A = 6A - 180 - 40
A = 6A - 220

""The ratio of my textbooks to storybooks is 4:3; if I have 28 textbooks, how many books do I have in total?""

Given that the ratio of textbooks to storybooks is 4:3, we can denote the number of textbooks as 4x and the number of storybooks as 3x, where x is a common multiplier.

Since we are told that the number of textbooks is 28, we can set up the equation:
4x = 28

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

Now that we know x, we can find the number of storybooks:
Number of storybooks = 3x = 3 * 7 = 21

To find the total number of books, we add the number of textbooks to the number of storybooks:
Total number of books = Number of textbooks + Number of storybooks

First, we translate the given problem into English:
""The product of the first and second of three positive numbers is 24; the product of the second and third is 48; and the product of the first and third is 32. What will be the smallest number?""

Now, let's denote the three numbers as A, B, and C. We have the following equations:

1. A * B = 24
2. B * C = 48
3. A * C = 32

From equation 1, we can express A in terms of B: A = 24 / B.

From equation 3, we can express A in terms of C: A = 32 / C.

Equating the two expressions for A, we get: 24 / B = 32 / C.

Rearranging the equation, we get: C = (32 * B) / 24 = (4 * B) / 3.

Now, substitute this expression for C into equation 2: B * (4 * B) / 3 = 48.

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 4 * B^2 = 144.

Divide both sides by 4: B^2 = 36.

Take the square root of both sides: B = 6 (since B is a positive number).

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the values of A and C:

A = 24 / B = 24 / 6 = 4.

C = (4 * B) / 3 = (4 * 6) / 3 = 8.

So, the three numbers are 4, 6, and 8. The smallest number among them is 4.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The product of two positive numbers is 162, and their quotient is 2. What are the numbers, and what is the smaller one?""

2. Solve the problem:
Let the two numbers be x and y, where x > y. 
We are given that their product is 162, so we can write an equation:
xy = 162

We are also given that their quotient is 2, so we can write another equation:
x/y = 2

Now, we can solve for x and y by rearranging the second equation to get:
x = 2y

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:
(2y)y = 162
2y^2 = 162
y^2 = 81
y = 9 (since y is a positive number)

Now that we have found y, we can find x:
x = 2y
x = 2(9)
x = 18

So, the two numbers are 18 and 9.

The measurements given are in centimeters (cm) and millimeters (mm), with 1 cm = 10 mm.

1. Length = 15 cm 2.4 mm = (15 * 10 mm) + 2.4 mm = 150 mm + 2.4 mm = 152.4 mm
2. Width = 7 cm 6.2 mm = (7 * 10 mm) + 6.2 mm = 70 mm + 6.2 mm = 76.2 mm
3. Height = 5 cm 8 mm = (5 * 10 mm) + 8 mm = 50 mm + 8 mm = 58 mm

Now, convert these measurements back into centimeters for uniformity since the question asks for the volume in cubic centimeters (or cm³):
- Length = 152.4 mm / 10 = 15.24 cm
- Width = 76.2 mm / 10 = 7.62 cm
- Height = 58 mm / 10 = 5.8 cm

The volume \(V\) of a box is calculated by multiplying its length \(l\), width \(w\), and height \(h\): \(V = l \times w \times h\).

So, \(V = 15.24 \times 7.62 \times 5.8\).

Calculating the volume:
\(V = 15.24 \times 7.62 = 116.1568\)
\(V = 116.1568 \times 5.8 = 673.70944\)

The problem states that a businessman sells 18 kilograms 300 grams of rice and 5 kilograms 750 grams of salt on a particular day. We are asked to find out how many kilograms of salt he sells in a month.

2. **Understanding the Given Information:**
- The amount of salt sold on a particular day is 5 kilograms 750 grams.
- To convert grams into kilograms, we remember that 1 kilogram = 1000 grams.
- Therefore, 750 grams is 750 / 1000 = 0.75 kilograms.
- So, the total amount of salt sold on that day is 5 kilograms + 0.75 kilograms = 5.75 kilograms.

3. **Calculating Monthly Sales:**
- Assuming a month has approximately 30 days, we can calculate the total amount of salt sold in a month by multiplying the daily amount by 30.
- Daily salt sales = 5.75 kilograms.
- Monthly salt sales = 5.75 kilograms/day * 30 days = 172.5 kilograms.

Now, let's break down the information given:
- Let the total length of the stick be L meters.
- The part in the ground is 1/2 of L, which is (1/2)L.
- The part in the water is 1/3 of L, which is (1/3)L.
- The part above the water is given as 3 meters.

Since the entire stick is made up of these three parts, we can write the equation:
(1/2)L + (1/3)L + 3 = L

To solve for L, first find a common denominator for 1/2 and 1/3, which is 6. So, the equation becomes:
(3/6)L + (2/6)L + 3 = L
Combine like terms:
(5/6)L + 3 = L

Subtract (5/6)L from both sides to isolate the variable:
3 = L - (5/6)L
3 = (1/6)L

Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for L:
18 = L

So, the total length of the stick is 18 meters.

To find the length of the stick in the ground, we calculate (1/2)L:
(1/2) * 18 = 9

Therefore, the length of the stick in the ground is 9 meters.

The problem states that 360 bigha of land can be cultivated by 4 tractors in 20 days. We are asked to find out how many tractors are needed to cultivate 1800 bigha of land in 10 days.

2. **Solution:**
First, let's establish the rate at which the tractors can cultivate the land. If 4 tractors can cultivate 360 bigha in 20 days, then together they can cultivate:
\[ \frac{360 \, \text{bigha}}{20 \, \text{days}} = 18 \, \text{bigha/day} \]
This means that 4 tractors together can cultivate 18 bigha of land per day.

To find out how much land 1 tractor can cultivate per day, we divide the rate by the number of tractors:
\[ \frac{18 \, \text{bigha/day}}{4 \, \text{tractors}} = 4.5 \, \text{bigha/day/tractor} \]

Now, we need to calculate how many tractors are required to cultivate 1800 bigha of land in 10 days. The total rate required is:
\[ \frac{1800 \, \text{bigha}}{10 \, \text{days}} = 180 \, \text{bigha/day} \]

Given that 1 tractor can cultivate 4.5 bigha/day, to find out how many tractors are needed to cultivate 180 bigha/day, we divide the total rate required by the rate per tractor:

Translation of the problem:
""A part of the bank of the Ichamati river is embanked by 40 workers in 35 days. How many workers will it take to embank the same part in 28 days?""

Let's denote:
- \(W\) as the work done (which is constant in both scenarios),
- \(N_1 = 40\) workers as the number of workers in the first scenario,
- \(D_1 = 35\) days as the number of days in the first scenario,
- \(N_2\) as the number of workers needed in the second scenario (which we are trying to find),
- \(D_2 = 28\) days as the number of days in the second scenario.

The formula relating work, number of workers, and days is \(W = N \times D\). Since \(W\) is constant, we can set the two scenarios equal to each other:
\[N_1 \times D_1 = N_2 \times D_2\]

Substituting the given values:
\[40 \times 35 = N_2 \times 28\]

Solving for \(N_2\):
\[N_2 = \frac{40 \times 35}{28}\]

\[N_2 = \frac{1400}{28}\]

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. First, convert the side length of the cube to meters since the dimensions of the tank are in meters. The side length of the cube is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters).

2. The volume of the cube is calculated as side^3. So, the volume of the cube = 0.5^3 = 0.125 cubic meters.

3. The volume of the tank is calculated as length * width * height. So, the volume of the tank = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 cubic meters.

4. When the tank is filled with water and the cube is removed, the volume of water in the tank will be the volume of the tank minus the volume of the cube. So, the volume of water = 6 - 0.125 = 5.875 cubic meters.

5. The depth of the water can be found by dividing the volume of the water by the area of the base of the tank (since volume = area * depth). The area of the base of the tank is length * width = 3 * 2 = 6 square meters.

6. Therefore, the depth of the water = volume of water / area of the base = 5.875 / 6 = 0.979167 meters.

""The sum of two numbers is 55, and the larger number is equal to 5 times the smaller number and 6 times the smaller number. Find the larger number.""

Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. We can write two equations based on the given information:

i) x + y = 55 ... (Equation 1)
ii) y = 5x and y = 6x are not both true, the correct interpretation is that 5 times the smaller number equals 6 times the smaller number is not given, instead, the problem likely means: y = 6x - 5x is not the case, so we can write y = 5x or y = 6x, but that would be two separate conditions, the correct condition given is: the larger number (y) equals 5 times the smaller number (5x).

However, considering the correct logical interpretation of the problem statement: ""বড় সংখ্যাটির ৫ গুণ ছোট সংখ্যাটির ৬ গুণের সমান"" translates to ""5 times the larger number equals 6 times the smaller number"", we should write:
5y = 6x

Now we have two equations:
x + y = 55 ... (Equation 1)
5y = 6x ... (Equation 2)

From Equation 2, we can express x in terms of y:
6x = 5y
x = (5/6)y

Substitute x in Equation 1:
(5/6)y + y = 55
Combine like terms:
(11/6)y = 55
Multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fraction:
11y = 330
Divide both sides by 11:

We can solve these equations to find the values of x and y.

From equation (2), we have x = y + 20.

Substituting this value of x in equation (1), we get:
y + 20 + y = 100
Combine like terms:
2y + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
2y = 80
Divide by 2:
y = 40

Now that we have y, we can find x using the equation x = y + 20:
x = 40 + 20
x = 60

So, the two numbers are 60 and 40. The smaller number is 40.

""Ahana got a total of 176 numbers in English and math in an exam, and she got 10 more numbers in math than in English. How many numbers did she get in math?""

Let's denote the number of marks Ahona got in English as E and in math as M. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total marks Ahona got in both subjects is 176, so E + M = 176.
2. She got 10 more marks in math than in English, so M = E + 10.

We can substitute the value of M from the second equation into the first equation:
E + (E + 10) = 176

Combine like terms:
2E + 10 = 176

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2E = 166

Divide both sides by 2:
E = 83

Now that we know Ahona got 83 marks in English, we can find out how many marks she got in math using the equation M = E + 10:
M = 83 + 10
M = 93

Therefore, Ahona got 93 marks in math.

""The garden is 21 meters long and 15 meters wide. There is a 2-meter wide path all around the garden. At the rate of 2.75 rupees per square meter, what will be the total cost of laying grass on the path?""

Now, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. Calculate the area of the garden including the path:
   - Length (L) = 21m + 2m + 2m = 25m
   - Width (W) = 15m + 2m + 2m = 19m
   - Area of garden including path = L * W = 25m * 19m = 475m²

2. Calculate the area of the garden itself:
   - Length (L) = 21m
   - Width (W) = 15m
   - Area of the garden = L * W = 21m * 15m = 315m²

3. Calculate the area of the path alone:
   - Area of path = Area of garden including path - Area of the garden
   - Area of path = 475m² - 315m² = 160m²

4. Calculate the total cost of laying grass on the path at 2.75 rupees per square meter:
   - Total cost = Area of path * Cost per square meter
   - Total cost = 160m² * 2.75 rupees/m² = 440 rupees

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares because they are the squares of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

Given the problem in Bengali translates to English as: ""Find the smallest number that when added to 5320 results in a perfect square.""

First, let's find the square root of 5320 to see what the nearest perfect squares are. 

The square root of 5320 is approximately 72.99. 

This means the nearest perfect squares below and above 5320 are 72^2 = 5184 and 73^2 = 5329, respectively.

Since we're looking for the smallest number to add to 5320 to make it a perfect square, we see that adding 9 (which is 5329 - 5320) would make 5320 a perfect square (5329), as 73^2 = 5329.

Therefore, the smallest number that needs to be added to 5320 to make the sum a perfect square is 9.

Translation: In a certain garden, 1800 saplings are to be planted in a square pattern, but 36 more saplings are available. Determine the number of saplings in each row.

Now, let's solve the problem. We are given that the total number of saplings is 1800 + 36 = 1836. Since the saplings are planted in a square pattern, the number of saplings in each row will be the same as the number of rows. Let's assume the number of saplings in each row is 'x'. Then, the total number of saplings can be represented as x * x = x^2.

We know that x^2 = 1836. To find 'x', we need to find the square root of 1836. 

x = √1836 ≈ 42.86

However, since the number of saplings must be a whole number, we need to find the closest perfect square to 1836. 

The closest perfect square to 1836 is 42^2 = 1764 (which is less than 1836) and 43^2 = 1849 (which is more than 1836). 

Since 36 extra saplings are available, it means the actual number of saplings to be planted in the square pattern should be a perfect square. In this case, the number of saplings (including the extra ones) should be close to but more than 1800. 

The closest perfect square more than 1800 is 43^2 = 1849. However, we were given 1836 saplings in total, which is 13 less than 1849. This suggests the problem might be slightly misunderstood in calculations because we are looking for a square that fits 1800 saplings perfectly before adding the extra 36.

We need a number whose square is close to 1800, which would be 42 (since 42^2 = 1764) or 43 (since 43^2 = 1849). Given that 36 extra trees make the total not a perfect square for the original number of trees (1800), and considering we're trying to find a square pattern that accommodates 1800 trees before the extra 36 are counted, let's re-evaluate what we're looking for.

""Geeta, Rita, and Meeta together have 180 rupees. Geeta has 6 rupees less than Rita and 12 rupees more than Meeta. How much money does Meeta have?""

Let's denote the amount of money Geeta has as G, Rita has as R, and Meeta has as M. 

We are given the following information:
1. G + R + M = 180
2. G = R - 6
3. G = M + 12

From (2) and (3), we can express R and M in terms of G:
R = G + 6
M = G - 12

Substituting these expressions into the first equation:
G + (G + 6) + (G - 12) = 180

Combining like terms:
3G - 6 = 180

Adding 6 to both sides:
3G = 186

Dividing both sides by 3:
G = 62

Now, using G = M + 12 to find M:
62 = M + 12

Subtracting 12 from both sides:
M = 50

Now, let's solve the problem:

The area of the road can be found by calculating the difference between the total area of the larger rectangle (including the garden and the road) and the area of the garden itself.

First, calculate the dimensions of the larger rectangle:
- Length of the larger rectangle: 60 meters (garden) + 2 meters (road on one side) + 2 meters (road on the other side) = 64 meters
- Width of the larger rectangle: 40 meters (garden) + 2 meters (road on one side) + 2 meters (road on the other side) = 44 meters

Now, calculate the areas:
- Area of the larger rectangle = Length * Width = 64 meters * 44 meters = 2816 square meters
- Area of the garden = Length * Width = 60 meters * 40 meters = 2400 square meters

The area of the road = Area of the larger rectangle - Area of the garden = 2816 square meters - 2400 square meters = 416 square meters

A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400. 

The problem asks for the total number of leap years from the time India gained independence until 2014.

India gained independence in 1947. 

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The total number of leap years in India after independence until 2014.""

2. To find the number of leap years from 1947 to 2014, we will calculate the total number of years and then determine how many of those are leap years.

Total years from 1947 to 2014 = 2014 - 1947 + 1 = 68 years.

Now, let's calculate the number of leap years in this period. 

Leap years occur every 4 years. So, from 1947 to 2014, the leap years would be 1948, 1952, 1956, ..., 2012.

The first leap year after 1947 is 1948, and the last leap year before or in 2014 is 2012.

We can set up a series for these leap years: 1948, 1952, ..., 2012.

This is an arithmetic series with the first term a = 1948 and the common difference d = 4.

The last term (l) is 2012.

We use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, a + (n-1)d = l, where 'a' is the first term, 'd' is the common difference, and 'l' is the last term.

1948 + (n-1)*4 = 2012

Subtract 1948 from both sides:

(n-1)*4 = 2012 - 1948
(n-1)*4 = 64

Divide both sides by 4:

n-1 = 64 / 4
n-1 = 16

Add 1 to both sides to find 'n':

n = 16 + 1
n = 17

So, there are 17 leap years from 1948 to 2012, inclusive, after India's independence until 2014.

""Someone's actual profit after 3 years is 1578 rupees and after 5 years is 1830 rupees. Determine the principal amount.""

Now, we know that the simple interest formula is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

Given that the interest after 3 years is 1578 rupees and after 5 years is 1830 rupees, we can set up the equations as follows:

Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be R.

Interest after 3 years: 1578 = P * R * 3
Interest after 5 years: 1830 = P * R * 5

To find the principal amount, we need to find the difference in interest between 5 years and 3 years, which will give us the interest for 2 years.

Interest for 2 years = Interest after 5 years - Interest after 3 years
= 1830 - 1578
= 252 rupees

Now, we know that this interest is for 2 years, so we can find the interest per year and then the total principal amount.

Interest per year = 252 / 2
= 126 rupees

Now, using the interest after 3 years:
1578 = P * R * 3
We know that 126 = P * R * 1 (since 126 is the interest per year)

So, 1578 = 126 * 3 * (P / P)
1578 = 378 * (P / P)
1578 = 378 * 1 (since P/P is 1)
But this equation doesn't help us directly. Let's re-evaluate our approach considering the actual formula and given data.

The correct approach should involve using the formula for simple interest and recognizing that the difference in interests over different time periods can help us determine the rate or principal.

However, let's reassess the given data more accurately:

The interest earned in 5 years is 1830, and in 3 years is 1578. The difference in interest between 5 years and 3 years is the interest earned in 2 years, which we've already calculated as 252.

""The train 120 meters long will cross a bridge 330 meters long. If the speed of the train is 30 km/h, how much time (in seconds) will it take for the train to cross the bridge?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total distance the train will travel to cross the bridge. This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge:
Total distance = length of train + length of bridge
= 120 meters + 330 meters
= 450 meters

2. Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s):
Speed in km/h = 30 km/h
Speed in m/s = (30 * 1000) / 3600
= 30000 / 3600
= 8.33 m/s

3. Now, we can find the time taken by the train to cross the bridge using the formula:
Time = distance / speed
= 450 meters / 8.33 m/s
= 54 seconds

Therefore, the train will take 54 seconds to cross the bridge.

""The current population of a city is 6.4 million. If the population growth rate of the city is 25 people per thousand per year, what will be the population of the city after 2 years?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Current population = 6,400,000
2. Population growth rate = 25 people per thousand per year
3. To find the population after 2 years, we need to calculate the growth rate as a percentage: (25/1000) * 100 = 2.5% per year
4. Population after 1 year = 6,400,000 + (6,400,000 * 0.025) = 6,400,000 + 160,000 = 6,560,000
5. Population after 2 years = 6,560,000 + (6,560,000 * 0.025) = 6,560,000 + 164,000 = 6,724,000

The problem states that 1 deciliter (0.1 liters, since 1 deciliter = 0.1 liters) of paint is enough to color 3/4 of a square meter. 

First, let's find out how much area 1 liter of paint can cover. Since 1 deciliter (0.1 liters) covers 3/4 of a square meter, 1 liter (which is 10 deciliters) will cover 10 times that area.

So, 1 liter of paint covers 10 * (3/4) = 7.5 square meters.

Now, we are given 4 deciliters (0.4 liters) of paint, and we want to know how much area it can cover. 

Since 1 liter covers 7.5 square meters, 0.4 liters will cover 0.4 * 7.5 = 3 square meters.

Therefore, 4 deciliters (or 0.4 liters) of paint can color 3 square meters.

""The current population of a city is 26250. If the population increases at an annual rate of 4%, then calculate the population after two years.""

Now, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. First, we calculate the increase in population after the first year:
   - Annual increase rate = 4% = 0.04
   - Current population = 26250
   - Increase in the first year = 26250 * 0.04 = 1050
   - Population after the first year = 26250 + 1050 = 27300

2. Next, we calculate the increase in population after the second year:
   - Current population (after the first year) = 27300
   - Increase in the second year = 27300 * 0.04 = 1092
   - Population after the second year = 27300 + 1092 = 28392

Therefore, the population after two years will be 28392.

""Translation: One number is 9 less than double the other, and their sum is 42. What is the larger number?""

Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. y = 2x - 9 (since one number is 9 less than double the other)
2. x + y = 42 (since their sum is 42)

We can substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation:

x + (2x - 9) = 42

Combine like terms:

3x - 9 = 42

Add 9 to both sides:

3x = 51

Divide by 3:

x = 17

Now that we have x, we can find y using the first equation:

Let's see how much Rajdeep got.""

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Rajdeep's father received from selling the guavas:
Total money = Number of guavas * Price per guava
Total money = 125 * 2
Total money = 250 rupees

Next, calculate the total cost of the pens and notebooks:
Cost of pens = Number of pens * Price per pen
Cost of pens = 2 * 5
Cost of pens = 10 rupees
Cost of notebooks = Number of notebooks * Price per notebook
Cost of notebooks = 2 * 20
Cost of notebooks = 40 rupees
Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks
Total cost = 10 + 40
Total cost = 50 rupees

Now, calculate the remaining money after buying the pens and notebooks:
Remaining money = Total money - Total cost
Remaining money = 250 - 50
Remaining money = 200 rupees

Since the remaining money is divided equally between two siblings, including Rajdeep, we'll divide the remaining money by 2:

Let's denote the amount of money Linkon got as L. Since Dalim got twice the amount of Linkon, Dalim's share = 2L.

We also know that Sabuj got 3/5 of Dalim's share, so Sabuj's share = (3/5) * 2L = 6L/5.

T = (100 × SI) / (P × R)
T = (100 × 2520) / (4500 × 8)
T = 252000 / 36000

""The annual profit decreases from 10 percent to 8 percent, how much less will be the profit on 3000 taka for 3 years?""

Now, let's calculate the profit at the original rate of 10% per annum for 3 years on 3000 taka, and then at the reduced rate of 8% per annum for 3 years on 3000 taka, and find the difference.

1. Calculate profit at 10% per annum for 3 years:
   - First year: 3000 * 10% = 300 taka
   - Second year: (3000 + 300) * 10% = 330 taka, total = 630 taka
   - Third year: (3000 + 630) * 10% = 363 taka, total = 993 taka

Alternatively, using the formula for compound interest A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and n is the number of years:
   - Amount after 3 years at 10% = 3000 * (1 + 10/100)^3
   - Amount after 3 years at 10% = 3000 * (1.1)^3
   - Amount after 3 years at 10% = 3000 * 1.331 = 3993 taka
   - Profit at 10% for 3 years = 3993 - 3000 = 993 taka

2. Calculate profit at 8% per annum for 3 years:
   - Using the same formula A = P(1 + r/100)^n:
   - Amount after 3 years at 8% = 3000 * (1 + 8/100)^3

""Find the larger number of a two-digit number pair between 50 and 100 whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is 16 and the sum is 144.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We are looking for two numbers, x and y, where 50 < x < 100 and 50 < y < 100.
2. The GCD of x and y is 16, which means both x and y are multiples of 16.
3. The sum of x and y is 144.

Given the constraints and the fact that both numbers must be multiples of 16, we can start by listing the multiples of 16 between 50 and 100: 64, 80, and 96.

Now, we look for pairs of these multiples that sum up to 144:
- 64 + 80 = 144

So, the pair of numbers that satisfy both conditions (GCD of 16 and sum of 144) is 64 and 80.

Between these two numbers, the larger one is 80.

Now, let's calculate the total area of the doors and windows:

- Area of one door = length * width = 2 * 1.25 = 2.5 square meters
- Since there are 3 doors, total area of doors = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 square meters
- Area of one window = length * width = 1.25 * 1 = 1.25 square meters
- Since there are 6 windows, total area of windows = 6 * 1.25 = 7.5 square meters
- Total area for doors and windows = 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 square meters

Next, let's calculate the area of one plank:

- Area of one plank = length * width = 5 * 0.60 = 3 square meters

""Translation: If a certain capital grows at the same rate of interest, the compound interest after one year is Rs. 6,500 and after two years is Rs. 6,570, then what is the principal amount?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Let the principal amount be P, and the annual interest rate be r (in decimal form).

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years.

We are given that after 1 year, the amount is Rs. 6,500, so we can write:
6,500 = P(1 + r)^1
6,500 = P + Pr

We are also given that after 2 years, the amount is Rs. 6,570, so we can write:
6,570 = P(1 + r)^2
6,570 = P + 2Pr + Pr^2

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:
70 = Pr + Pr^2
70 = Pr(1 + r)

Since the interest rate is the same, we can divide the second equation by the first equation to get:
(6,570 / 6,500) = (P + 2Pr + Pr^2) / (P + Pr)
(1.0116) = (1 + 2r + r^2) / (1 + r)

Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:
1.0116 + 1.0116r = 1 + 2r + r^2
0.0116 = r^2 + 0.9884r
0.0116 = r(r + 0.9884)

Solving for r, we get:
r ≈ 0.01 (or 1%)

Now that we have the interest rate, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the principal amount:
6,500 = P + Pr
6,500 = P + 0.01P
6,500 = 1.01P
P = 6,500 / 1.01
P ≈ 6,435.64

However, since we need to find the principal amount that would yield Rs. 6,500 as the compound interest after one year, we can use the formula:

Now, let's solve the problem. The formula to calculate the amount after a certain period with compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest
P = the principal amount (initial investment)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = time the money is invested for in years

Since the interest is compounded annually, n = 1. Given P = 5000, r = 10% or 0.10, and t = 6 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 5000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*6)
A = 5000(1 + 0.10)^6
A = 5000(1.10)^6
A = 5000 * 1.771561
A = 8857.805

So, after 6 years, the total amount (principal + interest) will be approximately 8857.81 taka.

The increase in profit over 4 years due to this 2% increase can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Increase in Profit} = C \times \frac{2}{100} \times 4 \]

Given that this increase equals 128 rupees, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times \frac{2}{100} \times 4 = 128 \]

""Ruhel borrowed 1800 taka from a bank and returned 2340 taka after three years. What was the annual rate of interest in percentage?""

Now, let's solve the problem:

Let the annual rate of interest be r%.

We know that the amount returned after three years (A) is equal to the principal amount (P) plus the interest (I). 

Given: 
P = 1800 taka
A = 2340 taka

Since A = P + I, we can find the interest:
I = A - P = 2340 - 1800 = 540 taka

The interest is calculated using the formula: 
I = P * r * t / 100

where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time in years.

Rearranging the formula to solve for r:
r = (I * 100) / (P * t)

Given: 
I = 540 taka
P = 1800 taka
t = 3 years

Substituting these values into the formula:
r = (540 * 100) / (1800 * 3)
r = 54000 / 5400
r = 10

Therefore, the annual rate of interest is 10%.

Translation: At what annual percentage profit will Rs. 13,000 amount to double the investment after 5 years?

Now, let's solve the problem. 

Let the annual percentage profit be 'r'%. We are given that an amount of Rs. 13,000 will amount to double the investment after 5 years. This implies that the amount after 5 years will be Rs. 26,000 (double the initial investment).

Using the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount after 'n' years, P is the principal amount, 'r' is the rate of interest, and 'n' is the number of years.

Here, A = 26000, P = 13000, n = 5. We need to find 'r'.

26000 = 13000(1 + r/100)^5
2 = (1 + r/100)^5
(1 + r/100) = 2^(1/5)
(1 + r/100) = 1.148698355
r/100 = 1.148698355 - 1
r/100 = 0.148698355

Translation: What is the smallest number from which if we subtract 4000, the difference will be divisible by 7, 11, and 13?

Now, to find this number, we need to understand that for a number to be divisible by 7, 11, and 13, it must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of 7, 11, and 13 is 7 * 11 * 13 = 1001.

This means the difference (after subtracting 4000) must be a multiple of 1001. To find the smallest such number, we should find the smallest multiple of 1001 that is greater than 4000, because we are looking for the smallest original number.

The first few multiples of 1001 are:
- 1001 * 1 = 1001
- 1001 * 2 = 2002
- 1001 * 3 = 3003
- 1001 * 4 = 4004

Since 4004 is the smallest multiple of 1001 that is greater than 4000, the smallest number from which subtracting 4000 gives a result divisible by 7, 11, and 13 is 4004 itself, because 4004 - 4000 = 4, which is not our target. We actually need to consider the next multiple of 1001 after 4000, which is indeed 4004. So, we were looking for the smallest number such that when 4000 is subtracted from it, the result is divisible by 7, 11, and 13, which means the number itself should be 4004 (to achieve a difference of 4, which was a misunderstanding in the calculation process).

To correct the process and provide clarity: 
We seek the smallest number that when 4000 is subtracted from it, results in a number divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Since the LCM of 7, 11, and 13 is 1001, we look for the first instance where subtracting 4000 yields a number that aligns with this requirement. Thus, the first multiple of 1001 greater than 4000 is indeed 4004, indicating that to achieve divisibility by 7, 11, and 13 after subtraction, we must start with"

""The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 14.4 cm. Find the length of one side of this equilateral triangle in decimal numbers.""

2. **Solution:**
An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length. The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. For an equilateral triangle with each side of length 's', the perimeter (P) can be calculated as:
\[ P = s + s + s = 3s \]

Given that the perimeter (P) of the equilateral triangle is 14.4 cm, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3s = 14.4 \]

To find the length of one side (s), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ s = \frac{14.4}{3} \]

\[ s = 4.8 \]

Therefore, the length of one side of the equilateral triangle is 4.8 cm.

1. **Translation of the Problem:** The problem asks for the ratio of the three angles of an equilateral triangle.

2. **Solution:** Since an equilateral triangle has three equal angles, and the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, we can calculate the measure of each angle. The formula for the sum of angles in a triangle is:
   - Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees
   
   For an equilateral triangle, Angle A = Angle B = Angle C. Let's denote each angle as A. Therefore:
   - A + A + A = 180 degrees
   - 3A = 180 degrees
   - A = 180 / 3 = 60 degrees

   So, each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees. The ratio of the angles, therefore, is 1:1:1 or simply 60:60:60.

Let's assume the price of the notebook is 'x' taka and the price of the pen is 'y' taka. 

According to the problem, the total price of the notebook and the pen is 75 taka, so we can write the equation:

x = 2y + 9

Now, we can substitute the value of x from the second equation into the first equation:
(2y + 9) + y = 75
Combine like terms:
3y + 9 = 75
Subtract 9 from both sides:
3y = 66
Divide by 3:
y = 22

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x:
x + y = 75
x + 22 = 75
Subtract 22 from both sides:
x = 53

Therefore, the price of the notebook is 53 taka.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem asks for the percentage profit or loss when 20 meters of cloth are sold at the cost price of 25 meters of cloth.

2. **Solution:**
Let's assume the cost price per meter of cloth is $1. Therefore, the cost price of 25 meters of cloth would be $25.

Given that the selling price of 20 meters of cloth is the same as the cost price of 25 meters of cloth, the selling price of 20 meters of cloth is $25.

Now, to find the cost price of 20 meters of cloth (since the cost price per meter is $1), it would be $20.

The formula for calculating profit percentage is: 
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{SP} - \text{CP}}{\text{CP}} \right) \times 100 \]

Given SP = $25 and CP = $20 for 20 meters of cloth:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{25 - 20}{20} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{5}{20} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Since the result is positive, it indicates a profit.

""Translation: In a park, there is a banyan tree and a pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the two trees was 2961 years. Currently, the age of the pine tree is 1432 years. What will be the current age of the banyan tree?""

Now, let's solve the problem:

Let the current age of the banyan tree be x.

150 years ago, the age of the pine tree was 1432 - 150 = 1282 years.

150 years ago, the age of the banyan tree was x - 150.

The sum of their ages 150 years ago was 2961, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 150) + 1282 = 2961

Combine like terms:

x - 150 + 1282 = 2961

x + 1132 = 2961

Subtract 1132 from both sides:

x = 1829

So, the current age of the banyan tree is 1829 years.

""Annual percentage at what rate will any principal amount be doubled in 8 years, i.e., the interest earned will be equal to the principal amount, which is Rs 18,850?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step. 

Given that the interest (I) earned is equal to the principal amount (P), we can say I = P. The formula for simple interest is:
I = (P * R * T) / 100

where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period in years.

Since I = P, we can rewrite the formula as:
P = (P * R * T) / 100

Given T = 8 years and I = P = 18,850, we substitute these values into the formula:
18,850 = (18,850 * R * 8) / 100

To find R, we simplify the equation:
18,850 = (18,850 * 8 * R) / 100
18,850 * 100 = 18,850 * 8 * R
1,885,000 = 150,800 * R
R = 1,885,000 / 150,800
R ≈ 12.5

Therefore, the annual percentage rate at which any principal amount will double in 8 years, given that the interest earned equals the principal amount of Rs 18,850, is approximately 12.5%.

Now, let's proceed with the solution. 
First, we need to find out how much money was left after giving 10,620,000 rupees to his wife.
Total money = 35,629,850 rupees
Money given to wife = 10,620,000 rupees
So, the remaining money = Total money - Money given to wife
= 35,629,850 - 10,620,000
= 25,009,850 rupees

Then, he divided 13,050,000 rupees equally among his three children. 
To find out how much each child received, we'll divide the total amount given to the children by the number of children:
Money given to each child = Total money given to children / Number of children
= 13,050,000 / 3
= 4,350,000 rupees

Now, let's calculate the amount donated to the village school:
Total remaining money = 25,009,850 rupees
Money given to children = 13,050,000 rupees
Money donated to school = Total remaining money - Money given to children
However, this information is not required to solve the problem, as we are asked to find the amount given to each child.

Therefore, the amount given to each child is 4,350,000 rupees.

1. **Translation of the Problem**: The problem states that the GCD and LCM of two numbers are 12 and 720, respectively. We need to find how many such pairs of numbers are possible.

2. **Understanding GCD and LCM Relationship**: For any two numbers, the product of the GCD and LCM equals the product of the two numbers themselves. Mathematically, this can be represented as:
   - GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b

Given GCD = 12 and LCM = 720, we have:
- 12 * 720 = a * b
- 8640 = a * b

This means the two numbers (a and b) must be factors of 8640 that when multiplied give 8640.

3. **Finding Factors**: To find pairs of numbers whose product is 8640 and have a GCD of 12, we can list factors of 8640. However, a more efficient approach is to use the fact that both numbers must be multiples of the GCD (12) since the GCD is a factor of both numbers.

4. **Breaking Down 8640**: 
- Prime factorization of 8640 is 2^7 * 3^3 * 5.
- Since GCD is 12 (2^2 * 3), both numbers must include at least these primes to their respective powers.

5. **Constructing Pairs**:
- Given the LCM is 720 (2^4 * 3^2 * 5), and knowing the GCD, we can see the LCM directly provides insight into the powers of primes that the larger number must have.
- The smaller number, then, must be constructed from the remaining powers of primes not included in the GCD but present in the LCM or from the product of the numbers (8640).

6. **Determining Possible Pairs**:
- Since the GCD contains 2^2 and 3, and the LCM contains up to 2^4, 3^2, and 5, we consider combinations that satisfy both conditions.
- The smaller number could be 12 (minimum to satisfy GCD), and the larger would be 720 (to satisfy LCM directly), or other combinations where factors are"

""The length of a room is three times its width. At a rate of 7.50 per square meter, the total cost to carpet the floor is 1102.50. Determine the length of the room.""

Let's denote the width of the room as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is three times the width, so L = 3W.

The area of the room (which needs to be carpeted) is given by the formula Area = Length * Width. We know the cost per square meter is 7.50, and the total cost is 1102.50. We can set up the equation for the total cost as follows: 

Total Cost = Area * Cost per Square Meter
1102.50 = (L * W) * 7.50

Since L = 3W, we substitute L in the equation:

1102.50 = (3W * W) * 7.50
1102.50 = (3W^2) * 7.50
1102.50 = 22.5W^2

To find W, we divide both sides by 22.5:

W^2 = 1102.50 / 22.5
W^2 = 49
W = sqrt(49)
W = 7

Since the length is three times the width (L = 3W), we find the length:

L = 3 * 7
L = 21

Therefore, the length of the room is 21 meters.

There are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 shirts in stock. These items are to be distributed evenly among some families. How many shirts will each family get?

To solve this, we find the GCD of 1071, 595! But actually, we should find the GCD of 1071, 595, and 357 to ensure that the distribution can be perfectly equal for all items. 

Finding the GCD of 1071, 595, and 357:

1. Factors of 1071: 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 33, 77, 99, 161, 231, 357, 1071
2. Factors of 595: 1, 5, 7, 17, 35, 85, 119, 595
3. Factors of 357: 1, 3, 7, 17, 21, 51, 119, 357

The greatest common factor among these numbers is 7 and 17, but since 7 is the highest common factor that appears in all three, it's not the correct approach as we missed considering the common factor that can actually divide all three without a remainder which seems to be 7 and then we should look into the items to see if it can be divided further. However, upon closer inspection, we see that 17 and 7 are common in two of the items and among all three, the number 7 is indeed the common divisor but we actually look for the highest number that can divide through the number of shirts as that is what is being queried.

Upon inspecting again for accuracy, we see that:
- The GCD of 1071 and 595 is 7 (as 595 = 7 * 85 and 1071 = 7 * 153).
- For 357, it is directly divisible by 7 (357 = 7 * 51).

So, each family gets 357 / 7 = 51 shirts.

Let's denote the distance between the two stations as D km. The time taken to travel this distance at 30 km/h is D/30 hours. At 25 km/h, the time taken would be D/25 hours.

The problem states that traveling at 25 km/h takes 10 minutes more than traveling at 30 km/h. We need to convert 10 minutes into hours, which is 10/60 = 1/6 hours.

So, we can set up the equation:
D/25 - D/30 = 1/6

To solve for D, we can find a common denominator, which is 150. Multiplying the entire equation by 150 to clear the denominators gives us:

D = 25

Therefore, the distance between the two stations is 25 kilometers.

Given that the ratio of girls to boys is 2:3, this means that out of every 5 people, 2 are girls and 3 are boys. The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 3 = 5 parts.

Since we have a total of 10 people and the ratio has 5 parts, we divide the total number of people by the total parts of the ratio to find out how many people each part represents:
10 people / 5 parts = 2 people per part.

Since girls constitute 2 parts of the ratio, we multiply the number of people per part by the number of parts that represent girls:
2 parts * 2 people per part = 4 girls.

Translation: The ratio of my age to Sutapa's age is 5:6; if my age is 10 years, then calculate Sutapa's age.

Given that the ratio of my age to Sutapa's age is 5:6, we can represent my age as 5x and Sutapa's age as 6x, where x is a constant.

We are told that my age is 10 years, which means 5x = 10. To find x, we divide both sides by 5:

5x = 10
x = 10 / 5
x = 2

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Sutapa's age by substituting x into the expression for Sutapa's age (6x):

Sutapa's age = 6x
Sutapa's age = 6 * 2
Sutapa's age = 12

Therefore, Sutapa's age is 12 years.

Translation: A rectangular field's length is three times its width. Walking around it once covers a distance of 1 kilometer. We need to find the width of the rectangular field.

Let's denote the width of the rectangular field as ""w"" and the length as ""3w"" since the length is three times the width.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width).

Given that walking around the field once (which is the perimeter) covers a distance of 1 kilometer (1000 meters), we can set up the equation:

2(3w + w) = 1000

Simplifying the equation:

2(4w) = 1000

8w = 1000

Dividing both sides by 8 to solve for w:

w = 1000 / 8

w = 125

Therefore, the width of the rectangular field is 125 meters.

Given that Lamia's hair is initially 8 inches long, if she cuts off 3 inches, we subtract the cut length from the initial length to find the final length.

Final length = Initial length - Cut length
             = 8 inches - 3 inches

""At a certain time, the profit-capital is 5600 rupees, and the profit is 2/5 of the capital. The profit is annual at an 8% rate. Determine the time.""

Now, let's break down the information given:

1. Profit (P) = 2/5 * Capital (C)
2. P = 5600 rupees
3. Annual rate of profit = 8%

From the first point, we can express the capital in terms of the profit:
C = (5/2) * P

Given that P = 5600, we substitute it into the equation:
C = (5/2) * 5600 = 14000 rupees

The formula for simple interest (which applies here as the profit is directly proportional to the principal, rate, and time) is:
P = (C * R * T) / 100

where P is the profit, C is the capital, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

Substituting the known values:
5600 = (14000 * 8 * T) / 100

To solve for T, we rearrange the equation:
T = (5600 * 100) / (14000 * 8)

Calculating T:
T = 560000 / 112000
T = 5

""The length of a rectangular field is 1.5 times its width. At a rate of 1.90 per square meter, it costs 10260.00 to lay grass. At a rate of 2.50 per meter, how much will it cost to fence around the field?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given that the length of the rectangular field is 1.5 times its width, we can express the length (L) in terms of the width (W):
L = 1.5W

The area of the rectangular field is given by the formula:
Area = Length * Width
We know that the cost of laying grass is 10260.00 at a rate of 1.90 per square meter. So, we can calculate the area as follows:
Area = Total Cost / Rate per square meter
= 10260.00 / 1.90
= 5400 square meters

Now, we can substitute L = 1.5W into the area formula:
5400 = 1.5W * W
5400 = 1.5W^2
W^2 = 5400 / 1.5
W^2 = 3600
W = √3600
W = 60 meters

Now that we have the width, we can find the length:
L = 1.5W
= 1.5 * 60
= 90 meters

The perimeter of the rectangular field, which is the distance around the field, can be calculated as follows:
Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
= 2(90 + 60)
= 2 * 150
= 300 meters

Finally, the cost of fencing around the field at a rate of 2.50 per meter can be calculated as follows:
Cost = Perimeter * Rate per meter
= 300 * 2.50
= 750.00

214,৯৭৮৬ কিগ্রা. ও ২৭৯৬ কিগ্রা. -এর ল.সা.গু এর মান খুঁজি।,১৯৫৭২,"To find the solution, first, we need to translate the given problem into English for clarity.

The problem states: ""9786 kg and 2796 kg - find the LCM of these two numbers.""

Now, to solve this, we will find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 9786 and 2796.

To find the LCM, we first need to find the prime factorization of both numbers:

1. For 9786:
   - 9786 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 7 * 7 * 7 (or \(2 * 3^2 * 7^3\))

2. For 2796:
   - 2796 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 13 (or \(2^2 * 3^3 * 13\))

Now, to find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
- For 2, the highest power between the two numbers is \(2^2\).
- For 3, the highest power is \(3^3\).
- For 7, since it only appears in 9786, we take \(7^3\).
- For 13, since it only appears in 2796, we take \(13^1\).

So, the LCM = \(2^2 * 3^3 * 7^3 * 13^1\) = \(4 * 27 * 343 * 13\).

Calculating this gives:
LCM = \(4 * 27 * 343 * 13\) = \(4 * 27 * 4469\) = \(108 * 4469\) = \(482892\).

Therefore, the LCM of 9786 and 2796 is 482892.

""Find the smallest non-zero perfect square number that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60.""

Now, to solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 25, 40, and 60, since the perfect square number must be divisible by all three numbers.

The prime factorizations of 25, 40, and 60 are:
25 = 5^2
40 = 2^3 * 5
60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:
LCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2 = 8 * 3 * 25 = 600

Now, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 600. To do this, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of the square of the highest power of each prime factor in the LCM. Since 600 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 4 * 9 * 25 = 900, but since we had 2^3, we actually need to consider 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 to ensure it's a perfect square when multiplied by the remaining 2 from 2^3, thus we actually consider 2^2 * 2 * 3^2 * 5^2 for our LCM to be a perfect square, so:
LCM_to_be_perfect_square = 2^2 * 2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 4 * 2 * 9 * 25 = 1800

However, the 2^3 in the LCM will require us to ensure the power of 2 is even to achieve a perfect square. So, for the powers of primes in 600 (2^3 * 3 * 5^2) to form a perfect square, we'll adjust it considering we need at least one more 2 to make 2^4 (so it becomes 2^4"

Given that a 5% compound interest is applicable on the entire loan, how much interest will Monowara Begum have to pay after 2 years?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's assume Monowara Begum took x amount at 6% interest rate and (56,000 - x) amount at 4% interest rate.

The total interest paid is 2,840 Tk. We can set up the equation:

0.06x + 0.04(56,000 - x) = 2,840

Simplifying the equation:

0.06x + 2,240 - 0.04x = 2,840

Combine like terms:

0.02x = 600

Divide by 0.02:

x = 30,000

So, Monowara Begum took 30,000 Tk at 6% interest rate and 26,000 Tk at 4% interest rate.

Now, let's calculate the total amount after 2 years with 5% compound interest:

Total loan = 56,000 Tk

Interest rate = 5%

Time = 2 years

Amount after 2 years = 56,000 * (1 + 0.05)^2
= 56,000 * (1.05)^2
= 56,000 * 1.1025
= 61,700

Interest after 2 years = 61,700 - 56,000
= 5,700

Therefore, Monowara Begum will have to pay 5,700 Tk as interest after 2 years.

""Two numbers have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 and a product of 30. Write the smaller number.""

Given that the GCD of the two numbers is 1, it implies that the two numbers are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1). The product of the two numbers is given as 30.

We can start by listing the factors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. Since the GCD of the two numbers is 1, the pairs of numbers must be such that they have no common factor other than 1.

Possible pairs of numbers with a product of 30 are:
- 1 and 30
- 2 and 15
- 3 and 10
- 5 and 6

Among these pairs, we need to find the one where both numbers are coprime (GCD = 1). 

Examining each pair:
- 1 and 30: GCD = 1
- 2 and 15: GCD = 1
- 3 and 10: GCD = 1
- 5 and 6: GCD = 1

All pairs have a GCD of 1, but we are looking for the smallest number among these pairs. The smallest number from these pairs is 1 (from the pair 1 and 30), 2 (from the pair 2 and 15), 3 (from the pair 3 and 10), and 5 (from the pair 5 and 6).

Therefore, the smallest number among these options is 1, but considering the context might imply looking for a pair where both numbers are greater than 1 and still coprime, the next smallest number would be 2.

""Two positive perfect square numbers have a product of 1576 and a ratio of 9/7. What is the larger number?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- The product of the two numbers is 1576.
- The ratio of the two numbers is 9/7.

Let's assume the smaller number is 7x and the larger number is 9x, where x is a common factor.

Since both numbers are perfect squares, we can write them as:
- Smaller number: 7x = a^2
- Larger number: 9x = b^2

The product of the two numbers is given as:
(7x) * (9x) = 1576
63x^2 = 1576

Now, let's find x:
x^2 = 1576 / 63
x^2 = 25
x = 5 (since x is positive)

Now that we have x, we can find the two numbers:
- Smaller number: 7x = 7 * 5 = 35
- Larger number: 9x = 9 * 5 = 45

However, 35 and 45 are not perfect squares. We made a mistake in assuming that 7x and 9x are perfect squares. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The ratio of the two numbers is 9/7, so we can write:
Larger number / Smaller number = 9/7

Let's assume the smaller number is 7a^2 and the larger number is 9a^2, where a is a common factor.

The product of the two numbers is given as:
(7a^2) * (9a^2) = 1576
63a^4 = 1576

Now, let's find a:
a^4 = 1576 / 63
a^4 = 25
a^2 = 5 (since a is positive)

Now that we have a^2, we can find the two numbers:

- Interest accrued = 5000 * 8% = 5000 * 0.08 = 400 rupees
- Total amount due = 5000 + 400 = 5400 rupees
- Repayment made = 2000 rupees
- Remaining balance = 5400 - 2000 = 3400 rupees

After the 2nd year:
- Interest accrued on the remaining balance = 3400 * 8% = 3400 * 0.08 = 272 rupees
- Total amount due = 3400 + 272 = 3672 rupees
- Repayment made = 2000 rupees
- Remaining balance = 3672 - 2000 = 1672 rupees

Therefore, after paying the 2nd installment, the person will still have 1672 rupees of loan left.

Answer: **1672**"
211,"হিসাব করে দেখি চার অঙ্কের কোন ক্ষুদ্রতম সংখ্যা ১২, ১৫, ২০ ও ৩৫ দিয়ে বিভাজ্য।",১২৬০,"To find the smallest four!-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35, we first need to translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:

""Calculate and find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

To find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

The prime factorizations of the given numbers are:
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 20 = 2^2 * 5
- 35 = 5 * 7

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors involved:
- LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420

Since we are looking for the smallest four-digit number, we need to find the smallest multiple of 420 that is greater than or equal to 1000.

Dividing 1000 by 420 gives us 2 with a remainder, so we need the third multiple of 420:
- 420 * 2 = 840
- 420 * 3 = 1260

Therefore, the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35 is 1260.

631,"দুইটি সংখ্যার যোগফল ১৬০ এবং একটি অপরটির তিনগুণ হলে,  বড় সংখ্যাটি নির্ণয় কর।",১২০,"To solve the given problem, let's first translate it into English for clarity:

""Two numbers have a sum of 160, and one number is three times the other. Find the larger number.""

Let's denote the smaller number as x. According to the problem, the larger number is three times the smaller number, so it is 3x. The sum of these two numbers is 160, which gives us the equation:

x + 3x = 160

Combine like terms:

4x = 160

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 160 / 4
x = 40

So, the smaller number is 40. The larger number, which is three times the smaller number, is:

3x = 3 * 40
= 120

Therefore, the larger number is 120.

448,৭৫ টাকায় ১৫ টি বলপেন কিনে ৯০ টাকায় বিক্রয় করলে শতকরা কত ভাগ লাভ হবে ?,২০,"To solve the problem, we first need to translate it into English for clarity:

""75 taka for 15 ballpens are bought and sold for 90 taka, what percentage of profit will be made?""

Now, let's calculate the cost price and selling price per ballpen:

Cost price for 15 ballpens = 75 taka
Cost price per ballpen = 75 / 15 = 5 taka

Selling price for 15 ballpens = 90 taka
Selling price per ballpen = 90 / 15 = 6 taka

Profit per ballpen = Selling price per ballpen - Cost price per ballpen = 6 - 5 = 1 taka

Percentage of profit = (Profit per ballpen / Cost price per ballpen) * 100
= (1 / 5) * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of profit made is 20%.

Answer: **20**"
