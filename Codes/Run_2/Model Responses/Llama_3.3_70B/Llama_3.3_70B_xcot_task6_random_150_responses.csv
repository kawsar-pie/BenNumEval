The problem states: ""Find the smaller number whose sum with another number is 147 and is 4 more than 0.375 times the other number.""

## Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the other number as y.

## Step 3: Formulate the equations based on the given conditions
From the problem, we have two equations:
1. x + y = 147 (The sum of the two numbers is 147)
2. x = 0.375y + 4 (The smaller number is 4 more than 0.375 times the other number)

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations
We can substitute the expression for x from the second equation into the first equation:
0.375y + 4 + y = 147

## Step 5: Combine like terms and solve for y
Combine y terms: 1.375y + 4 = 147
Subtract 4 from both sides: 1.375y = 143
Divide by 1.375: y = 143 / 1.375
y = 104

## Step 6: Find the value of x using the value of y
Now that we have y, we can find x using the equation x = 0.375y + 4
x = 0.375 * 104 + 4
x = 39 + 4
x = 43

## Step 7: Verify that x is indeed the smaller number
Since x (43) is less than y (104), x is the smaller number.

The problem states that the difference between the current ages of a father and his son is 15 years. We need to find the difference in their ages 30 years later.

## Step 2: Define the current ages of the father and the son.
Let's denote the current age of the son as S and the current age of the father as F. According to the problem, F - S = 15.

## Step 3: Express the ages of the father and the son 30 years later.
30 years later, the son's age will be S + 30, and the father's age will be F + 30.

## Step 4: Calculate the difference in their ages 30 years later.
The difference in their ages 30 years later will be (F + 30) - (S + 30). Simplifying this, we get F - S, which is the same as their current age difference because the 30 years added to both ages cancels out when subtracted.

## Step 5: Determine the final numerical answer.
Since the difference in their ages remains constant regardless of the years passed (because both ages increase by the same amount), the difference 30 years later will still be 15 years.

The final answer is: **15**"

The problem states that there are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 jackets in stock. These items are to be divided equally among some families. We need to find out how many dhotis each family will receive.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of items that need to be divided.
To find the number of dhotis each family will receive, we first need to identify the total number of items. However, the problem specifically asks for the distribution of dhotis, so we focus on the 1071 dhotis.

## Step 3: Identify the common divisor for the items to be divided equally.
Since the items are to be divided equally among families, we look for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the total number of each item type that can represent the number of families. However, the problem does not require us to find the GCD of all items, but rather to divide the dhotis equally, implying we need to find a factor of 1071 that could represent the number of families.

## Step 4: Find the factors of 1071 to determine possible family group sizes.
To divide the dhotis equally, we need to find the factors of 1071. 1071 can be factored into its prime factors to find all possible combinations.

## Step 5: Factorize 1071 into its prime factors.
1071 = 3 * 7 * 3 * 17 (or \(3^2 * 7 * 17\)), which gives us the prime factors.

## Step 6: Determine the number of dhotis per family based on the factors.
Given the prime factorization, we can see that 1071 has several factors, but without knowing the exact number of families, we look for the largest factor that could realistically represent the number of families and thus the smallest number of dhotis per family. However, the problem implies a direct division without specifying the number of families, suggesting we might be looking for a factor that directly answers how many dhotis each family gets if we consider the items are divided into equal groups without remainder.

## Step 7: Consider the implications of the problem statement.
Since the problem asks for the number of dhotis per family without specifying the number of families or any other divisor, and given that we cannot divide the dhotis into fractions, we look for a straightforward"

The problem states that the total cost of 2 cows and 3 goats is 45080 rupees. Additionally, it's given that the cost of one goat is 4560 rupees. We need to find the cost of one cow.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the goats.
First, we calculate the total cost of the 3 goats. Since one goat costs 4560 rupees, the total cost for 3 goats is 3 * 4560 = 13680 rupees.

## Step 3: Determine the total cost of the cows.
The total cost of 2 cows and 3 goats together is 45080 rupees. Since we found that the total cost of the 3 goats is 13680 rupees, we subtract this from the total cost to find the cost of the 2 cows. So, the cost of 2 cows is 45080 - 13680 = 31400 rupees.

## Step 4: Calculate the cost of one cow.
To find the cost of one cow, we divide the total cost of the 2 cows by 2. Therefore, the cost of one cow is 31400 / 2 = 15700 rupees.

The problem states that Faiz and Ayaz had some apple cores. If Faiz gave 10 apple cores to Ayaz, Ayaz would have three times the number of apple cores as Faiz. Additionally, if Ayaz gave 20 apple cores to Faiz, Faiz would have twice the number of apple cores as Ayaz.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the initial number of apple cores Faiz has as F and the initial number of apple cores Ayaz has as A.

## Step 3: Formulate the equations based on the given conditions.
From the first condition, we have: A + 10 = 3(F - 10).
From the second condition, we have: F + 20 = 2(A - 20).

## Step 4: Simplify the equations.
Simplifying the first equation: A + 10 = 3F - 30, which gives A = 3F - 40.
Simplifying the second equation: F + 20 = 2A - 40, which gives F = 2A - 60.

## Step 5: Solve the system of equations.
Substitute the expression for F from the second equation into the first equation: A = 3(2A - 60) - 40.
Expanding the equation: A = 6A - 180 - 40, which simplifies to A = 6A - 220.
Rearranging the equation: 220 = 6A - A, which gives 220 = 5A.
Solving for A: A = 220 / 5 = 44.

The problem states that Rajib, Debangana, Masum, and Tajmira together can complete 150 units of work in 6 days. We need to find out how many days it will take for Rajib and Tajmira to complete 250 units of work, assuming each person works at the same rate every day.

## Step 2: Calculate the total work done per day by all four individuals.
First, we determine the total work done per day by all four individuals. Since they complete 150 units of work in 6 days, their combined work rate per day is 150 / 6 = 25 units per day.

## Step 3: Calculate the work done per day by Rajib and Tajmira.
Since there are four individuals working at the same rate, we assume that each person's contribution to the total work per day is equal. Thus, the work done per day by one person is 25 / 4 = 6.25 units. Therefore, the combined work rate of Rajib and Tajmira per day is 6.25 * 2 = 12.5 units.

## Step 4: Determine the number of days required for Rajib and Tajmira to complete 250 units of work.
To find out how many days it will take for Rajib and Tajmira to complete 250 units of work at their combined rate of 12.5 units per day, we divide the total work by their daily work rate: 250 / 12.5 = 20 days.

The problem states that the current population of a city is 26250 people. It asks us to calculate the population for the next year, given that the population increases at an annual rate of 4%.

## Step 2: Calculate the increase in population.
To find the increase in population, we need to calculate 4% of the current population. This can be done by multiplying the current population by 0.04 (which is the decimal equivalent of 4%).

## Step 3: Apply the calculation.
Increase in population = Current population * 0.04
Increase in population = 26250 * 0.04
Increase in population = 1050

## Step 4: Calculate the population for the next year.
To find the population for the next year, we add the increase in population to the current population.
Population for the next year = Current population + Increase in population
Population for the next year = 26250 + 1050
Population for the next year = 27300

The problem states that we have a triangular field with a base of 24 meters and a height of 15 meters 50 centimeters, and we need to find its area.

## Step 2: Convert the height to a single unit
First, we need to convert the height from meters and centimeters to just meters. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 50 centimeters is equal to 0.5 meters. So, the height is 15 meters + 0.5 meters = 15.5 meters.

## Step 3: Apply the formula for the area of a triangle
The formula for the area of a triangle is given by: Area = (base * height) / 2. Plugging in the given values, we get Area = (24 * 15.5) / 2.

## Step 4: Calculate the area
Now, we perform the multiplication first: 24 * 15.5 = 372. Then, we divide the result by 2 to get the area: 372 / 2 = 186.

The problem states that Mr. Ray, a government official, is going to India for a pilgrimage. Given that 1 Bangladeshi Taka is equal to 0.63 Indian Rupees, we need to find out how many Bangladeshi Takas are required to exchange for 3000 Indian Rupees.

## Step 2: Determine the exchange rate from Indian Rupees to Bangladeshi Takas.
To find the exchange rate from Indian Rupees to Bangladeshi Takas, we take the reciprocal of the given exchange rate. Since 1 Taka = 0.63 Rupees, the exchange rate from Rupees to Takas is 1 Rupee = 1 / 0.63 Takas.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of Bangladeshi Takas equivalent to 3000 Indian Rupees.
Using the exchange rate calculated in Step 2, we multiply 3000 Indian Rupees by the exchange rate to find the equivalent amount in Bangladeshi Takas. This can be calculated as 3000 * (1 / 0.63).

## Step 4: Perform the calculation to find the equivalent amount in Bangladeshi Takas.
3000 * (1 / 0.63) = 3000 / 0.63 = 4761.905 (approximately).

## Step 2: Recall the relationship between GCD, LCM, and the two numbers.
The product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCD and LCM. This relationship can be expressed as:
GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b, where a and b are the two numbers.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula.

The problem states that a businessman sells 18 kg 300 grams of rice and 5 kg 750 grams of salt on a certain day. We need to calculate how many kilograms of salt he sells in a month.

## Step 2: Convert the given weights into a standard unit for easier calculation.
First, let's convert the weights into grams for uniformity. 18 kg 300 grams of rice is equivalent to 18300 grams, and 5 kg 750 grams of salt is equivalent to 5750 grams.

## Step 3: Determine the ratio or proportion of salt sold compared to rice.
The problem mentions the sale of both rice and salt but asks specifically about the salt. However, to find out how much salt is sold in a month based on a single day's sales, we first need to establish if there's a direct relationship or ratio between the sales of rice and salt that we can apply. Since the problem does not explicitly provide a ratio or comparison that affects the monthly sales calculation directly, we will proceed with the information given about the salt.

## Step 4: Calculate the daily sale of salt in kilograms.
To find out how much salt is sold in a day in kilograms, we convert 5750 grams to kilograms. Since 1 kg = 1000 grams, 5750 grams is equal to 5.75 kg.

## Step 5: Calculate the monthly sale of salt.
Assuming a month has approximately 30 days, we can estimate the monthly sales of salt by multiplying the daily sales by 30. Monthly salt sales = 5.75 kg/day * 30 days.

## Step 6: Perform the multiplication to get! the monthly sales figure.
Monthly salt sales = 5.75 kg/day * 30 days = 172.5 kg.

The problem states that 1/2 of a stick is in the ground, 1/3 of the stick is in water, and the remaining part is above the water. The length of the part above the water is 3 meters.

## Step 2: Determine the total length of the stick
Let's denote the total length of the stick as L. The portion above the water is given as 3 meters. We know that the stick is divided into three parts: in the ground (1/2*L), in the water (1/3*L), and above the water. Since these parts together make up the whole stick, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

## Step 3: Set up the equation to find the total length of the stick
Since 1/2 of the stick is in the ground and 1/3 is in the water, the remaining portion above the water can be represented as 1 - (1/2 + 1/3) = 1 - (3/6 + 2/6) = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6 of the stick. We are given that this portion (1/6 of the stick) is equal to 3 meters. So, we can write the equation as 1/6 * L = 3.

## Step 4: Solve for the total length of the stick (L)
To find L, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6: L = 3 * 6 = 18 meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the length of the stick in the ground
Since 1/2 of the stick is in the ground, we calculate this portion by multiplying the total length of the stick by 1/2: 1/2 * 18 = 9 meters.

The problem states that a portion of the Ichamati riverbank takes 40 workers 35 days to complete. We need to calculate how many workers would be required to complete the same portion in 28 days.

## Step 2: Identify the inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time required to complete the task.
The problem involves an inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time needed to complete the task. This means that as the number of workers increases, the time required decreases, and vice versa, assuming the work rate remains constant.

## Step 3: Establish the formula based on the inverse relationship.
The formula for inverse relationship is W1 * T1 = W2 * T2, where W1 and T1 are the initial number of workers and time, and W2 and T2 are the final number of workers and time. We can rearrange this formula to solve for W2, the number of workers needed for the new time frame: W2 = (W1 * T1) / T2.

## Step 4: Plug in the given values into the formula to find W2.
Given that W1 = 40 workers, T1 = 35 days, and T2 = 28 days, we can substitute these values into the formula: W2 = (40 * 35) / 28.

## Step 5: Calculate W2.

A perfect square number is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect square numbers because they are the squares of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

## Step 3: Determine the closest perfect square to 9585.
To find the closest perfect square to 9585, we first need to find the square root of 9585. The square root of 9585 is approximately 97.74.

## Step 4: Identify the perfect square numbers just below and above 9585.
Since the square root of 9585 is approximately 97.74, the perfect square number just below 9585 is 97^2 = 9409, and the perfect square number just above 9585 is 98^2 = 9604.

## Step 5: Calculate the difference between 9585 and the nearest perfect square below it.
To find the smallest number to subtract from 9585 to get a perfect square, we calculate the difference between 9585 and the perfect square below it, which is 9585 - 9409 = 176.

## Step 6: Verify if subtracting this difference results in a perfect square.
If we subtract 176 from 9585, we get 9585 - 176 = 9409, which is indeed a perfect square (97^2).

## Step 7: Conclude the smallest number to subtract.
Therefore, the smallest number that needs to be subtracted from 9585 to result in a perfect square is 176.

The final answer is: **176**"

The problem states: ""I have 150 taka. I bought a notebook with 0.3 parts of my money and a storybook with 0.4 parts of my money. Now, let's calculate how much money I have left.""

## Step 2: Calculate the amount of money spent on the notebook.
To find out how much money was spent on the notebook, we multiply the total amount of money by 0.3. So, the amount spent on the notebook is 150 * 0.3 = 45 taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the amount of money spent on the storybook.
To find out how much money was spent on the storybook, we multiply the total amount of money by 0.4. So, the amount spent on the storybook is 150 * 0.4 = 60 taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money spent.
The total amount of money spent is the sum of the money spent on the notebook and the storybook, which is 45 + 60 = 105 taka.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of money left.
To find out how much money is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money. So, the amount of money left is 150 - 105 = 45 taka.

The problem states that there is an empty tank with a length of 3 meters, a width of 2 meters, and a height of 1 meter. Inside this tank, a solid metallic cube with a side length of 50 cm (or 0.5 meters) is placed. After filling the tank with water and then removing the cube, we need to find the depth of the water.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the tank.
To find the volume of the tank, we multiply its length, width, and height. So, the volume of the tank = length * width * height = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 cubic meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cube.
The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = side^3, where ""side"" is the length of a side of the cube. Given the side length of the cube is 0.5 meters, the volume of the cube = 0.5^3 = 0.125 cubic meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of water in the tank after the cube is removed.
When the tank is filled with water and the cube is removed, the volume of water that remains is equal to the volume of the tank minus the volume of the cube. So, the volume of water = volume of the tank - volume of the cube = 6 - 0.125 = 5.875 cubic meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the depth of the water after the cube is removed.
Since the cube is removed, the water occupies the entire base area of the tank. The base area of the tank = length * width = 3 * 2 = 6 square meters. To find the depth of the water, we divide the volume of the water by the base area of the tank. So, the depth of the water = volume of water / base area = 5.875 / 6.

## Step 6: Perform the division to find the depth of the water.
Depth of the water = 5.875 / 6 = 0.97917 meters.

The problem states that the sum of two numbers is 55, and the larger number is equal to 5 times the smaller number, while the smaller number is equal to 6 times the larger number is not correct, it should be the larger number is 5 times the smaller number and the smaller number is 6 times another relationship but based on the translation error, we understand the sum and the relation between the two numbers as: two numbers whose sum is 55 and the larger number is 5 times the smaller one.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the two numbers
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. According to the problem, we have two equations: x + y = 55 and y = 5x.

## Step 3: Substitute y in the first equation with 5x from the second equation
Substituting y = 5x into the equation x + y = 55 gives x + 5x = 55, which simplifies to 6x = 55.

## Step 4: Solve for x
Divide both sides by 6 to solve for x: x = 55 / 6.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of x
Perform the division to find the value of x: x = 9.16666667. Since x must be a whole number as per the usual context of such problems, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the translation or initial setup. The correct relationship should be directly derived from the problem statement without assuming an incorrect relationship. Given the correct understanding that one number is 5 times the other and their sum is 55, we proceed with the corrected step.

## Step 6: Correct the equation based on the proper understanding of the problem
Given that the larger number (y) is 5 times the smaller number (x), we have y = 5x. And since their sum is 55, x + y = 55. Substituting y = 5x into the sum equation gives x + 5x = 55, simplifying to 6x = 55.

## Step 7: Correctly solve for x with proper rounding if necessary
However, recognizing the error in assuming a decimal solution for what is typically an integer problem, we revisit our equations. The mistake was in the interpretation of the relationship and not solving with integers in mind from the start.

The problem states that the sum of two numbers is 100 and their difference is 20. We need to find the smaller number.

## Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the larger number as L and the smaller number as S.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information
We have two equations:
1. L + S = 100 (sum of the two numbers is 100)
2. L - S = 20 (difference between the two numbers is 20)

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations
We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of L and S.

## Step 5: Add the two equations to eliminate S
(L + S) + (L - S) = 100 + 20
This simplifies to 2L = 120.

## Step 6: Solve for L
Divide both sides by 2 to find L:
L = 120 / 2
L = 60

## Step 7: Substitute L back into one of the original equations to solve for S
Using L + S = 100 and substituting L = 60:
60 + S = 100

## Step 8: Solve for S
Subtract 60 from both sides:
S = 100 - 60
S = 40

## Step 9: Identify the smaller number
S is the smaller number, which we found to be 40.

The problem states that Ahona received a total of 176 marks in English and Mathematics combined, with 10 more marks in Mathematics than in English. We need to find out how many marks she received in Mathematics.

## Step 2: Define variables for the marks received in English and Mathematics
Let's denote the marks received in English as E and the marks received in Mathematics as M. We know that M = E + 10.

## Step 3: Write an equation representing the total marks received
The total marks received in both subjects is 176, so we can write the equation E + M = 176. Substituting M = E + 10 into this equation gives us E + (E + 10) = 176.

## Step 4: Solve the equation to find the marks received in English
Combining like terms, we get 2E + 10 = 176. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 2E = 166. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us E = 83.

## Step 5: Find the marks received in Mathematics
Now that we know E = 83, we can find M by using the relationship M = E + 10. So, M = 83 + 10 = 93.

The problem states that there is a garden with a length of 21 meters and a width of 15 meters. Surrounding the garden on all four sides is a path that is 2 meters wide. The task is to calculate the total cost of laying grass on this path at a rate of 2.75 rupees per square meter.

## Step 2: Calculate the total area of the garden including the path.
To find the area of the garden including the path, we first need to calculate the outer dimensions of the garden and the path. The length including the path is 21 + 2 + 2 = 25 meters, and the width including the path is 15 + 2 + 2 = 19 meters. The total area including the path is 25 * 19 = 475 square meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the garden itself.
The area of the garden without the path is 21 * 15 = 315 square meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the path alone.
To find the area of the path, we subtract the area of the garden from the total area including the path: 475 - 315 = 160 square meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the total cost of laying grass on the path.
Given the cost per square meter is 2.75 rupees, the total cost for the path is 160 * 2.75 = 440 rupees.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the amount of money Geeta has as G, Rita has as R, and Mita has as M.

## Step 3: Establish the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. G + R + M = 180 (Combined total of their money)
2. G = R - 6 (Geeta has 6 rupees less than Rita)
3. G = M + 12 (Geeta has 12 rupees more than Mita)

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can start by expressing R and M in terms of G using equations 2 and 3.
From equation 2, we have R = G + 6.
From equation 3, we have M = G - 12.

## Step 5: Substitute the expressions for R and M into the first equation.
Substituting R = G + 6 and M = G - 12 into G + R + M = 180, we get:
G + (G + 6) + (G - 12) = 180

## Step 6: Solve for G.
Combining like terms, we have:
3G - 6 = 180
Adding 6 to both sides gives:
3G = 186
Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
G = 62

## Step 7: Find the value of M using G.
Now that we know G = 62, we can find M using the equation M = G - 12:
M = 62 - 12

## Step 2: Calculate the total area of the garden.
To find the area of the road, we first need to calculate the total area of the garden. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length times width. So, the total area of the garden is 60 meters * 40 meters = 2400 square meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the garden excluding the road.
The road is 2 meters wide, so we subtract 2 meters from both the length and the width of the garden to find the dimensions of the garden excluding the road. The new length is 60 - 2 - 2 = 56 meters, and the new width is 40 - 2 - 2 = 36 meters. The area of the garden excluding the road is 56 meters * 36 meters = 2016 square meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the road.
The area of the road can be found by subtracting the area of the garden excluding the road from the total area of the garden. So, the area of the road is 2400 square meters - 2016 square meters = 384 square meters.

## Step 2: Determine the starting year
India gained independence in 1947. We need to consider the years from 1948 to 2014 to determine the number of leap years.

## Step 3: Identify the leap years
Leap years occur every 4 years. We start with 1948, which is a leap year, and then every 4 years thereafter (1952, 1956, 1960, ... , 2012).

## Step 4: Calculate the number of leap years
To calculate the number of leap years from 1948 to 2014, we can use the formula: ((last year - first year) / 4) + 1, considering that both the first and last years are leap years if they are divisible by 4.

## Step 5: Apply the formula
First year = 1948, Last year = 2012 (since 2014 is not a leap year and we are looking for leap years up to 2014).
((2012 - 1948) / 4) + 1 = (64 / 4) + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17

The problem states that a certain principal amount yields a profit of 1578 rupees in 3 years and a profit of 1830 rupees in 5 years. We need to find the principal amount.

## Step 2: Define the variables and the formula for simple interest.
Let's denote the principal amount as P and the annual interest rate as r. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest earned and t is the time in years.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
We can set up two equations using the given information:
- For 3 years: 1578 = P * r * 3
- For 5 years: 1830 = P * r * 5

## Step 4: Simplify the equations to find the relationship between them.
We can simplify these equations to find the relationship between the principal and the interest rate. However, we can also notice that the difference in interest earned between 5 years and 3 years can help us find the annual interest and then solve for the principal.

## Step 5: Calculate the difference in interest earned between 5 years and 3 years.
The difference in interest earned is 1830 - 1578 = 252 rupees over 2 years. This means the annual interest is 252 / 2 = 126 rupees.

## Step 6: Use the annual interest to find the principal amount.
Now, knowing the annual interest, we can use the equation for 3 years to solve for P: 1578 = P * 126 * 3. Simplifying, we get 1578 = P * 378.

## Step 7: Solve for the principal amount P.
Divide both sides of the equation by 378 to solve for P: P = 1578 / 378.

## Step 8: Calculate the value of P.
Perform the division to find the value of P.

The problem states that a wholesaler makes a 20% profit and a retailer makes a 20% profit from selling a product. If the retail selling price of the product is 576 rupees, we need to find the cost price for the wholesaler.

## Step 2: Calculate the cost price for the retailer.
Let's assume the cost price for the retailer is x rupees. Since the retailer makes a 20% profit, the selling price (which is the retail selling price) will be x + 20% of x. We know this selling price is 576 rupees. So, we can write the equation as x + 0.20x = 576.

## Step 3: Solve the equation for the retailer's cost price.
Combine like terms to get 1.20x = 576. To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 1.20. Thus, x = 576 / 1.20.

## Step 4: Calculate the value of x.
Perform the division to find x. x = 480 rupees. This is the cost price for the retailer.

## Step 5: Calculate the cost price for the wholesaler.
Since the retailer buys from the wholesaler, the cost price for the retailer (480 rupees) is the selling price for the wholesaler. The wholesaler makes a 20% profit, so if we let the cost price for the wholesaler be y, then y + 20% of y = 480.

## Step 6: Solve the equation for the wholesaler's cost price.
This equation simplifies to y + 0.20y = 480, which further simplifies to 1.20y = 480. To solve for y, divide both sides by 1.20.

## Step 7: Calculate the value of y.
Perform the division to find y. y = 480 / 1.20.

## Step 8: Calculate the final value.
Do the math to find the cost price for the wholesaler. y = 400 rupees.

The problem states that the product of two positive numbers is 147, and the larger number is three times the smaller number. We need to find the larger number.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the smaller number as x. Since the larger number is three times the smaller number, the larger number can be denoted as 3x.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
The product of the two numbers is 147, so we can write the equation as x * 3x = 147. This simplifies to 3x^2 = 147.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
To find x, we need to solve the equation 3x^2 = 147. First, divide both sides by 3 to get x^2 = 49.

## Step 5: Find the value of x.
Taking the square root of both sides of the equation x^2 = 49 gives us x = 7.

## Step 6: Find the larger number.
Since the larger number is 3x and x = 7, the larger number is 3 * 7 = 21.

The problem states that Pooja borrowed some money from a bank at an annual interest rate of 12% and after one year, she paid an interest of 1680 rupees. We need to find out the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed).

## Step 2: Understand the formula for simple interest.
The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal (P) * Rate (R) * Time (T)) / 100. Here, we know SI = 1680, R = 12%, and T = 1 year. We need to find P.

## Step 3: Apply the simple interest formula to solve for the principal amount.
Using the formula SI = (P * R * T) / 100, we can rearrange it to solve for P: P = (SI * 100) / (R * T). Substituting the given values, we get P = (1680 * 100) / (12 * 1).

## Step 4: Calculate the principal amount.
Now, we calculate the principal amount using the values we have: P = (1680 * 100) / 12 = 168000 / 12 = 14000.

The problem states that the sum of two numbers is 55, and the larger number is equal to 6 times the smaller number, which can also be expressed as 5 times the smaller number being equal to the larger number. We need to find the smaller number.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem
Let's denote the smaller number as 'x' and the larger number as 'y'. According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. x + y = 55 (The sum of the two numbers is 55)
2. y = 6x (The larger number is 6 times the smaller number, or alternatively, 5x = y, but this will be adjusted in the next step for clarity and correctness in representing the relationship given)

## Step 3: Correct the second equation based on the problem statement
The correct interpretation of ""বড় সংখ্যাটির ৫ গুণ ছোট সংখ্যাটির ৬ গুণের সমান"" translates to ""5 times the larger number is equal to 6 times the smaller number"". Thus, the correct equation should be 5y = 6x.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations
From Step 2, we have:
1. x + y = 55
And from Step 3, we corrected the relationship to:
2. 5y = 6x

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's express y in terms of x from the second equation:
y = (6/5)x

## Step 5: Substitute y in the first equation
Substituting y = (6/5)x into the equation x + y = 55 gives:
x + (6/5)x = 55
Combining like terms:
(5x + 6x)/5 = 55
11x/5 = 55

## Step 6: Solve for x
Multiplying both sides by 5 to solve for x:
11x = 55 * 5
11x = 275
x = 275 / 11

## Step 7: Calculate x
x = 25

The problem states that Monowara Begum took a loan at 6% interest rate for some amount and at 4% interest rate for another amount for her family's needs. She took a total loan of 56,000 takas and paid 2,840 takas as interest at the end. We need to find the annual interest if 5% interest is applicable on the entire loan.

## Step 2: Define variables for the amounts taken at different interest rates
Let's denote the amount taken at 6% interest rate as 'x' and the amount taken at 4% interest rate as 'y'. We know that x + y = 56,000.

## Step 3: Calculate the interest paid on each amount
The interest paid on 'x' at 6% interest rate is 0.06x, and the interest paid on 'y' at 4% interest rate is 0.04y. The total interest paid is 2,840 takas, so 0.06x + 0.04y = 2,840.

## Step 4: Use the information from step 2 and step 3 to form equations
From step 2, we have: x + y = 56,000.
From step 3, we have: 0.06x + 0.04y = 2,840.

## Step 5: Solve the equations to find the values of x and y
We can solve these equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method for simplicity.

First, multiply the first equation by 0.04 to align the coefficients of y: 0.04x + 0.04y = 2,240.

Now, subtract this equation from the interest equation (0.06x + 0.04y = 2,840) to eliminate y:
(0.06x + 0.04y) - (0.04x + 0.04y) = 2,840 - 2,240,
which simplifies to 0.02x = 600.

Solving for x gives: x = 600 / 0.02 = 30,000.

## Step 6: Find the value of y
Now that we have x, we can find y using the equation x + y = 56,000.
So, 30,000 + y = "

The problem states that a 120-meter-long train will cross a 330-meter-long bridge. The speed of the train is given as 30 km/h, and we need to find out how long it will take for the train to cross the bridge in seconds.

## Step 2: Convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s.
To convert the speed from km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 m/3600 s = 5/18 m/s. Therefore, the speed of the train in m/s is 30 * (5/18) = 8.33 m/s.

## Step 3: Calculate the total distance the train needs to cover to cross the bridge.
The total distance the train needs to cover is the sum of its own length and the length of the bridge: 120 m (train length) + 330 m (bridge length) = 450 m.

## Step 4: Use the formula distance = speed * time to find the time taken by the train to cross the bridge.
We can rearrange the formula to solve for time: time = distance / speed. Plugging in the values, we get time = 450 m / 8.33 m/s.

The problem states that the current population of a city is 6.4 million (64 lakh) and the population growth rate is 25 people per thousand. We need to find the population of the city after 2 years.

## Step 2: Calculate the annual population growth rate as a decimal.
First, we convert the growth rate to a decimal: 25 people per thousand is equivalent to 0.025 (since 25/1000 = 0.025).

## Step 3: Apply the population growth formula to calculate the population after 1 year.
The formula for population growth is P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in years. For the first year, the population will be 6,400,000 * (1 + 0.025) = 6,400,000 * 1.025.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation for the population after 1 year.
Population after 1 year = 6,400,000 * 1.025 = 6,560,000.

## Step 5: Apply the population growth formula again to calculate the population after the second year.
Using the same formula, for the second year, the population will grow from 6,560,000 by the same rate: 6,560,000 * (1 + 0.025) = 6,560,000 * 1.025.

1. y = 2x - 9 (since one number is 9 less than twice the other)
2. x + y = 42 (since their sum is 42)

## Step 4: Substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation
Substituting y = 2x - 9 into the equation x + y = 42 gives us:
x + (2x - 9) = 42

## Step 5: Solve the equation for x
Combining like terms, we get:
3x - 9 = 42
Adding 9 to both sides gives us:
3x = 51
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
x = 17

## Step 6: Find the value of y using the value of x
Now that we know x = 17, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find y. Using y = 2x - 9:
y = 2(17) - 9
y = 34 - 9
y = 25

## Step 7: Identify the larger number
Since y = 25 and x = 17, y is the larger number.

The final answer is: **25**"

The problem states that there is a square field with one side measuring 300 meters, and around it, there is a 4-meter-wide road. We need to find the area of this road.

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the larger square including the road
To find the area of the road, we first need to calculate the area of the larger square that includes the road. Since the road is 4 meters wide, we add 4 meters to each side of the square field. So, the side length of the larger square is 300 + 4 + 4 = 308 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the larger square
The area of the larger square is the square of its side length, which is 308 * 308 = 94864 square meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the square field
The area of the square field itself is the square of its side length, which is 300 * 300 = 90000 square meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the area of the road
The area of the road is the difference between the area of the larger square and the area of the square field, which is 94864 - 90000 = 4864 square meters.

## Step 2: Define the variables for each brother's share.
Let's denote the amount of money Lincoln receives as L. According to the problem, Dalim receives twice as much as Lincoln, so Dalim's share is 2L. Sabuj receives 3/5 of what Dalim gets, which means Sabuj's share is (3/5) * 2L = 6L/5.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the total amount distributed.
The total amount distributed among the brothers is 6300 rupees. So, the sum of their shares equals 6300: L + 2L + 6L/5 = 6300.

## Step 4: Solve the equation to find the value of L.
First, we find a common denominator to combine the terms: (5L + 10L + 6L) / 5 = 6300. This simplifies to 21L / 5 = 6300. Multiply both sides by 5 to get 21L = 31500. Then, divide both sides by 21 to solve for L: L = 31500 / 21 = 1500.

## Step 5: Calculate Dalim's share using the value of L.

The problem asks to find a two-digit number between 50 and 100 whose greatest common divisor (GCD) with 16 is 2, and when added to another two-digit number, the sum equals 144. We need to find the larger of these two numbers.

## Step 2: Determine the conditions for the numbers.
The GCD with 16 being 2 implies that the number must be even but not divisible by 4, 8, or 16, as those would have a GCD greater than 2 with 16.

## Step 3: List possible numbers between 50 and 100 that meet the GCD condition.
Numbers between 50 and 100 that are even but not divisible by 4 are: 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 70, 74, 78, 82, 86, 90, 94, 98. However, we need to ensure they are not divisible by 8 or 16 as well. Thus, excluding those divisible by 4 (which also includes those divisible by 8 and 16), we focus on numbers like 50, 58, 62, 70, 74, 82, 86, 94, 98.

## Step 4: Find pairs of numbers that sum to 144.
We are looking for pairs of numbers (x, y) where x + y = 144, and one of the numbers must be from the list generated in step 3.

## Step 5: Examine each possible number to find a pair that sums to 144.
- For 50: 50 + 94 = 144
- Other numbers do not form a pair with another two-digit number between 50 and 100 that sums exactly to 144, given the constraints.

## Step 6: Identify the larger number of the pair that meets all conditions.
The pair (50, 94) meets the condition, and the larger number is 94.

The problem states that a certain principal amount, when subjected to compound interest at a certain rate for one year, grows to Rs. 6500, and when subjected to the same rate of compound interest for two years, it grows to Rs. 6570. We need to find the original principal amount.

## Step 2: Define the variables and the formula for compound interest.
Let's denote the principal amount as P and the annual interest rate as r (in decimal form). The formula for the amount A after n years at compound interest is given by A = P(1 + r)^n.

## Step 3: Apply the compound interest formula for one year and two years.
For one year, the amount is Rs. 6500, so we have 6500 = P(1 + r)^1.
For two years, the amount is Rs. 6570, so we have 6570 = P(1 + r)^2.

## Step 4: Solve the equations to find the relationship between the amounts after one and two years.
Dividing the equation for two years by the equation for one year gives 6570/6500 = (1 + r)^2 / (1 + r)^1.
Simplifying, we get 6570/6500 = 1 + r.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of (1 + r) from the given amounts.
6570/6500 = 1.01077 (approximately), which means 1 + r = 1.01077.

## Step 6: Find the value of r.
r = 1.01077 - 1 = 0.01077 or approximately 1.077%.

## Step 7: Use the value of r to find the principal amount P using the one-year equation.
Substituting r back into the one-year equation: 6500 = P(1 + 0.01077).
So, P = 6500 / (1 + 0.01077).

## Step 8: Calculate the principal amount P.
P = 6500 / 1.01077 ≈ 6435.57.

The problem states that Mr. Ramiz deposited 5000 taka into a bank and decided not to withdraw any money for the next 6 years. The bank's annual interest rate is 10%. We need to calculate the total amount of principal and interest after 6 years.

## Step 2: Calculate the interest earned each year.
To find the interest earned each year, we multiply the principal amount by the interest rate. In the first year, the interest earned is 5000 * 0.10 = 500 taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the total amount after the first year.
The total amount after the first year is the principal plus the interest earned, which is 5000 + 500 = 5500 taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the interest earned in the subsequent years.
In the second year, the interest earned is 5500 * 0.10 = 550 taka. The total amount after the second year is 5500 + 550 = 6050 taka. We repeat this process for the remaining 4 years.

## Step 5: Calculate the interest earned in the remaining years.
Year 3: Interest = 6050 * 0.10 = 605 taka, Total = 6050 + 605 = 6655 taka.
Year 4: Interest = 6655 * 0.10 = 665.5 taka, Total = 6655 + 665.5 = 7320.5 taka.
Year 5: Interest = 7320.5 * 0.10 = 732.05 taka, Total = 7320.5 + 732.05 = 8052.55 taka.

The problem states that due to an increase in annual profit from 8% to 10%, Tisha Marma's income increased by 128 rupees over 4 years. We need to find out her initial capital.

## Step 2: Calculate the difference in profit percentage.
The difference in profit percentage is 10% - 8% = 2%.

## Step 3: Determine the increase in income due to the 2% increase in profit.
Let's assume Tisha's initial capital is x rupees. The increase in income over 4 years due to the 2% increase in profit is given by the formula: increase = (2/100) * x * 4.

## Step 4: Set up an equation to represent the situation.
We know that the increase in income is 128 rupees, so we can set up the equation: (2/100) * x * 4 = 128.

## Step 5: Solve the equation to find the initial capital.
To solve for x, we can simplify the equation: (2/100) * 4x = 128, which becomes (8/100)x = 128. Multiplying both sides by 100/8, we get x = 128 * (100/8).

The problem states that Tanvir's farm has 50 horses and 60 cows. Each cow gives birth to 2 calves per year. We need to find out the total number of animals on the farm after one year.

## Step 2: Calculate the initial total number of animals on the farm.
Initially, the farm has 50 horses and 60 cows, making a total of 50 + 60 = 110 animals.

## Step 3: Determine the number of calves born in a year.
Since each cow gives birth to 2 calves per year and there are 60 cows, the total number of calves born in a year will be 60 * 2 = 120 calves.

The problem states that out of 30 oranges in a box, we measured the weight of 3 oranges and found them to be 235 grams, 120 grams, and 365 grams respectively. We need to determine the total weight of the 30 oranges in kilograms based on the average weight.

## Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the 3 measured oranges
To find the average weight, first, we need to calculate the total weight of the 3 oranges that were measured. Total weight = 235 grams + 120 grams + 365 grams = 720 grams.

## Step 3: Calculate the average weight of the 3 measured oranges
The average weight of the 3 oranges is calculated by dividing the total weight by the number of oranges. Average weight = Total weight / Number of oranges = 720 grams / 3 = 240 grams.

## Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the 30 oranges
Since we are assuming that the average weight of the 3 measured oranges is representative of the average weight of all 30 oranges, we can calculate the total weight of the 30 oranges by multiplying the average weight by the total number of oranges. Total weight of 30 oranges = Average weight * Total number of oranges = 240 grams * 30 = 7200 grams.

## Step 5: Convert the total weight from grams to kilograms
To convert the total weight from grams to kilograms, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams). Total weight in kilograms = 7200 grams / 1000 = 7.2 kilograms.

The final answer is: **7.2**"

The problem states that Ruheel borrowed 1800 taka from a bank and returned 2340 taka after three years. We need to find the annual interest rate as a percentage.

## Step 2: Determine the total interest paid
To find the interest rate, we first need to calculate the total interest paid over the three years. The total interest paid can be found by subtracting the initial borrowed amount from the final returned amount: Total Interest = Returned Amount - Borrowed Amount = 2340 - 1800 = 540 taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the annual interest
Since the interest is compounded annually, we can use the formula for simple interest to estimate the annual interest rate, given that the problem does not specify compounding. The formula for simple interest is: Total Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. Here, Principal = 1800 taka, Total Interest = 540 taka, and Time = 3 years.

## Step 4: Apply the simple interest formula to find the rate
Rearranging the simple interest formula to solve for Rate gives us: Rate = Total Interest / (Principal * Time) = 540 / (1800 * 3).

## Step 5: Perform the calculation
Calculate the rate: Rate = 540 / 5400 = 0.1 or 10% when expressed as a percentage.

The problem states: ""What is the annual percentage profit, if an amount of 13000 becomes double of the principal and profit in 5 years?""

## Step 2: Understand the given information
We have the principal amount (P) = 13000, time period (t) = 5 years, and the amount after 5 years (A) is twice the principal, so A = 2P = 26000.

## Step 3: Determine the profit
The profit is the difference between the amount after 5 years and the principal, so profit = A - P = 26000 - 13000 = 13000.

## Step 4: Use the formula for simple interest to find the rate of interest
The formula for simple interest is: I = (P * r * t) / 100, where I is the interest (or profit in this case), P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period in years. We are given I = 13000, P = 13000, and t = 5. We need to solve for r.

## Step 5: Rearrange the formula to solve for r
Rearranging the formula I = (P * r * t) / 100 to solve for r, we get: r = (I * 100) / (P * t).

## Step 6: Calculate the rate of interest
Substitute the given values into the rearranged formula: r = (13000 * 100) / (13000 * 5).

The problem states that the combined salary of Farida and Fatema is 19950 Takas, and Fatema earns 2450 Takas more than Farida. We need to find Farida's salary.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the salaries of Farida and Fatema.
Let's denote Farida's salary as F and Fatema's salary as T.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total salary of Farida and Fatema is 19950 Takas, so F + T = 19950.
2. Fatema earns 2450 Takas more than Farida, so T = F + 2450.

## Step 4: Substitute the expression for T from the second equation into the first equation to solve for F.
Substituting T = F + 2450 into the equation F + T = 19950 gives us F + (F + 2450) = 19950.

## Step 5: Simplify and solve the equation for F.
Combining like terms, we get 2F + 2450 = 19950. Subtracting 2450 from both sides gives 2F = 19950 - 2450, which simplifies to 2F = 17500. Dividing both sides by 2 gives F = 17500 / 2 = 8750.

The problem translates to: ""What will be the difference between the simple interest and compound interest on a sum of 5000 taka for 3 years at an annual interest rate of 10%?""

## Step 2: Calculate the simple interest.
To calculate the simple interest, we use the formula: Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100. Here, Principal = 5000 taka, Rate = 10%, and Time = 3 years. So, SI = (5000 * 10 * 3) / 100.

## Step 3: Perform the simple interest calculation.
SI = (5000 * 10 * 3) / 100 = 1500 taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the compound interest.
To calculate the compound interest, we use the formula: Amount = Principal * (1 + (Rate/100))^Time. Then, Compound Interest (CI) = Amount - Principal. For the first year, the amount is 5000 * (1 + 10/100) = 5000 * 1.1 = 5500 taka. For the second year, it becomes 5500 * 1.1 = 6050 taka. For the third year, it becomes 6050 * 1.1 = 6655 taka.

## Step 5: Calculate the compound interest.
CI = Amount - Principal = 6655 - 5000 = 1655 taka.

## Step 6: Find the difference between the compound interest and simple interest.
Difference = Compound Interest - Simple Interest = 1655 - 1500.

## Step 7: Calculate the difference.
Difference = 1655 - 1500 = 155 taka.

The problem statement translates to: ""What is the smallest number from which if 4000 is subtracted, the result is divisible by 7, 11, and 13?""

## Step 2: Understand the requirements for divisibility
To be divisible by 7, 11, and 13, the number must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 7, 11, and 13. Since 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: 7 * 11 * 13 = 1001.

## Step 3: Determine the condition for the difference to be divisible by 1001
For the difference (the original number minus 4000) to be divisible by 1001, the original number minus 4000 must be a multiple of 1001. This means the original number itself must be 4000 more than a multiple of 1001.

## Step 4: Find the smallest number that satisfies the condition
To find the smallest such number, we start with the smallest multiple of 1001 and add 4000. The smallest multiple of 1001 is 1001 itself. However, since we're looking for the smallest number from which subtracting 4000 results in a number divisible by 1001, we should consider the first few multiples of 1001 to ensure we've found the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions.

## Step 5: Calculate the smallest number
Starting with 1001, if we subtract 4000, we get a negative number. We need to find the smallest multiple of 1001 such that when 4000 is subtracted, the result is still positive and divisible by 1001. The first multiple to consider is 1001 * 1 = 1001, but 1001 - 4000 is negative. The next is 1001 * 2 = 2002, but 2002 - 4000 is also negative. We continue until we find a suitable multiple. For 1001 * 3 = 3003, 3003 - 4000 is still negative. For 1001 * 4 = 4004, 4004 - 4000 = 4, which is positive but not a multiple of 1001. For 1001 * 5 = 5005, 5005 -"

The problem states that the total cost of a notebook and a pen is 75 rupees. If the cost of the notebook is 5 rupees less and the cost of the pen is 2 rupees more, then the cost of the notebook would be twice the cost of the pen. We need to find the cost of the notebook.

## Step 2: Define variables for the cost of the notebook and the pen.
Let's denote the cost of the notebook as N and the cost of the pen as P.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
The total cost of the notebook and the pen is 75 rupees, so we can write the equation: N + P = 75.

## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the modified costs.
If the cost of the notebook is 5 rupees less (N - 5) and the cost of the pen is 2 rupees more (P + 2), then the cost of the notebook would be twice the cost of the pen, so we can write the equation: N - 5 = 2(P + 2).

## Step 5: Simplify the second equation.
Simplifying the equation N - 5 = 2(P + 2), we get N - 5 = 2P + 4. Rearranging terms, we get N = 2P + 9.

## Step 6: Substitute the expression for N from Step 5 into the equation from Step 3.
Substituting N = 2P + 9 into the equation N + P = 75, we get (2P + 9) + P = 75.

## Step 7: Solve for P.
Combining like terms, we get 3P + 9 = 75. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3P = 66. Dividing both sides by 3, we get P = 22.

## Step 8: Find the cost of the notebook using the value of P.
Now that we know P = 22, we can substitute this value back into the equation N + P = 75 to find N. So, N + 22 = 75. Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get N = 53.

The problem states: ""If 25 meters of cloth are bought at the same price at which 20 meters of cloth are sold, what percentage of profit or loss will occur?""

## Step 2: Determine the cost and selling price relationship.
To find the percentage of profit or loss, we first need to establish the relationship between the cost price (CP) and the selling price (SP). Since 25 meters of cloth are bought at the same price as 20 meters are sold, we can consider the cost of 25 meters as the cost price and the selling price of 20 meters as the selling price for our calculation.

## Step 3: Calculate the cost price per meter and the selling price per meter.
Let's assume the total cost for 25 meters of cloth is $C. Therefore, the cost price per meter is $C/25. When selling 20 meters at the same total cost, the selling price per meter is $C/20.

## Step 4: Establish the formula for percentage profit or loss.
The formula for percentage profit is ((SP - CP) / CP) * 100, and for percentage loss is ((CP - SP) / CP) * 100. Here, since we are dealing with the cost and selling price per meter, we compare the cost price per meter of 25 meters to the selling price per meter of 20 meters.

## Step 5: Apply the formula to calculate the percentage profit or loss.
We calculate the cost price per meter as $C/25 and the selling price per meter as $C/20. To find the profit or loss percentage: ((($C/20) - ($C/25)) / ($C/25)) * 100.

## Step 6: Simplify the formula.
First, find a common denominator for $C/20 and $C/25, which is 100. This gives us (($5C/100) - ($4C/100)) / ($4C/100) * 100. Simplifying further: (($5C - $4C) / $4C) * 100 = ($C / $4C) * 100 = (1/4) * 100.

## Step 7: Calculate the final percentage.
(1/4) * 100 = 25%. This calculation indicates the percentage profit since the selling price per meter is higher than the cost price per meter.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the ages of the trees 150 years ago.
Let's denote the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago as B and the age of the Pine tree 150 years ago as P.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the information given about the ages 150 years ago.
We know that 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the two trees was 2961 years. So, we can write the equation: B + P = 2961.

## Step 4: Determine the age of the Pine tree 150 years ago.

The problem translates to: ""At what annual percentage of profit will a certain principal amount become Rs. 18850 in 8 years, with the interest being compounded annually?""

## Step 2: Understand the formula for compound interest.
The formula for compound interest is given by A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and n is the number of years.

## Step 3: Identify the variables given in the problem.
We are given A = 18850, n = 8 years, and we need to find the rate of interest (r). However, the principal amount (P) is not directly provided.

## Step 4: Recognize the relationship between the principal, interest, and amount.
The amount A is the sum of the principal P and the interest I. Thus, A = P + I. Given A = 18850, we can deduce that the interest earned I = A - P = 18850 - P.

## Step 5: Use the compound interest formula to express the amount after 8 years.
Since the interest is compounded annually, we use the formula A = P(1 + r/100)^n. Given A = 18850 and n = 8, we have 18850 = P(1 + r/100)^8.

## Step 6: Realize that the problem does not directly provide the principal amount P.
To find 'r', we typically need 'P'. However, we can rearrange the formula to solve for 'r' if we express 'P' in terms of 'A' and 'r'.

## Step 7: Solve for 'r' using the formula and given conditions.
We aim to find 'r' such that 18850 = P(1 + r/100)^8. Without the exact principal, we must recognize this as a problem of finding 'r' given the final amount and time, assuming the principal is part of the information not directly provided but implied in the question's context.

## Step 8: Consider an alternative approach since direct calculation seems challenging without the principal amount.
Given the nature of the problem, it seems we might have misunderstood the direct application of the formula without the principal amount. The key information we missed is recognizing the problem might be asking for the rate at which a principal becomes a certain amount after a"

## Step 6: Determine the amount each child received
Since 13,050,000 rupees were distributed equally among the three children, we divide this amount by 3 to find out how much each child received.
Amount each child received = Total amount distributed among children / Number of children
Amount each child received = 13,050,000 / 3

## Step 7: Perform the division
Amount each child received = 4,350,000

The final answer is: **4350000**"

The problem states that the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers are 12 and 720, respectively. We need to find out how many pairs of numbers can have these properties.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between GCD, LCM, and the product of two numbers.
For any two numbers, a and b, the product of their GCD and LCM equals the product of a and b. This relationship is expressed as: GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b.

## Step 3: Apply the relationship to find the product of the two numbers.
Given GCD = 12 and LCM = 720, we can find the product of the two numbers: 12 * 720 = 8640. This means that the product of the two numbers must be 8640.

## Step 4: Determine the factors of 8640 that satisfy the GCD condition.
To satisfy the GCD condition of 12, both numbers must be multiples of 12. We need to list all the factor pairs of 8640 where both factors are multiples of 12.

## Step 5: List factor pairs of 8640 that are multiples of 12.
The factors of 8640 that are multiples of 12 are: (12, 720), (24, 360), (36, 240), (48, 180), (60, 144), and (72, 120), (84, 102.86), (96, 90). However, since both numbers in a pair must be integers and the GCD and LCM conditions must be satisfied exactly, we only consider pairs where both numbers are integers and multiples of 12.

## Step 6: Identify the valid pairs based on the conditions.
From the listed factors, we identify the valid pairs: (12, 720), (24, 360), (36, 240), (48, 180), (60, 144), and (72, 120), and (96, 90).

## Step 7: Consider the symmetry and duplicates.
Each pair has a symmetric counterpart (e.g., (12, 720) and (720, 12)), but these represent the same pair of numbers. Thus, we do not need to double count them.

The problem states that each chocolate is bought for 8 units of currency and sold for 8.50 units of currency, resulting in a profit of 25 units of currency. We need to find out how many chocolates were bought.

## Step 2: Determine the profit made from selling one chocolate.
To find the profit made from selling one chocolate, we subtract the cost price from the selling price. So, the profit per chocolate = selling price - cost price = 8.50 - 8 = 0.50 units of currency.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of chocolates bought.
We know that the total profit made is 25 units of currency. Since the profit per chocolate is 0.50 units of currency, we can find the total number of chocolates by dividing the total profit by the profit per chocolate. Total number of chocolates = total profit / profit per chocolate = 25 / 0.50.

## Step 4: Perform the division to find the total number of chocolates.
Total number of chocolates = 25 / 0.50 = 50.

The problem states that the area of a triangular piece of land is 216 square meters, with a base of 18 meters, and asks us to find the height.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle.
The formula for the area of a triangle is given by: Area = (base * height) / 2.

## Step 3: Apply the formula to find the height of the triangle.
Given the area (216 square meters) and the base (18 meters), we can plug these values into the formula: 216 = (18 * height) / 2.

The problem states that the length of a room is three times its width. The total cost to carpet the floor of the room is 1102.50 taka at a rate of 7.50 taka per square meter. We need to find the length of the room.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the dimensions of the room.
Let's denote the width of the room as W and the length as L. According to the problem, L = 3W.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the room.
The area of the room (A) can be calculated using the formula A = L * W. Substituting L = 3W into the formula gives A = 3W * W = 3W^2.

## Step 4: Use the cost to find the area of the room.
The cost per square meter is 7.50 taka, and the total cost is 1102.50 taka. Therefore, the area of the room can be found by dividing the total cost by the cost per square meter: A = 1102.50 / 7.50.

## Step 5: Calculate the area of the room using the given costs.
Performing the division gives A = 1102.50 / 7.50 = 147.

## Step 6: Solve for the width of the room using the area.
Since A = 3W^2, substituting A = 147 gives 147 = 3W^2. Solving for W^2 gives W^2 = 147 / 3 = 49. Therefore, W = sqrt(49) = 7.

The problem states that there are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 shirts in stock. These items are to be distributed evenly among some families. We need to find out how many shirts each family will receive.

## Step 2: Identify the key information given in the problem.
The key information provided is the quantity of each item: 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 shirts.

## Step 3: Determine the common factor that can divide all the given quantities without a remainder.
To distribute the items evenly, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1071, 595, and 357.

## Step 4: Calculate the GCD of the given quantities.
First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors:
- 1071 = 3 * 7 * 3 * 17
- 595 = 5 * 7 * 17
- 357 = 3 * 7 * 17

## Step 5: Identify the common prime factors among the quantities.
The common prime factors are 7 and 17, and one factor of 3 is common among 1071 and 357 but not in 595. However, for distributing evenly among families, we consider the common factors that appear in all, which are 7 and 17.

## Step 6: Calculate the GCD using the common prime factors.
GCD = 7 * 17 = 119

## Step 7: Determine how many shirts each family will receive based on the GCD.
Since the GCD represents the number of items each family can receive without splitting any item, and we are specifically asked about shirts, we divide the total number of shirts by the GCD to find how many families can be formed and then realize that this step actually tells us how many groups can be made, not directly how many shirts per family. However, since each group (or family) should ideally get an equal share of shirts, and the GCD itself doesn't directly give us the number of shirts per family but rather the divisor, we recognize that the actual question aims at understanding distribution based on common divisors. Given the mistake in directly applying GCD to find shirts per family without considering the distribution mechanism, the proper step should involve recognizing that the GCD helps in determining the possible even distribution but the real task is to find out how many"

The problem states that Sakir has 450 yellow buttons and tries to arrange them in a square shape. After arranging, 9 buttons are left over. We need to find out how many buttons are in each row of Sakir's arrangement.

## Step 2: Understand the mathematical concept involved.
The problem involves finding the largest square number that is less than or equal to 450, since the leftover buttons indicate that the total number of buttons is not a perfect square.

## Step 3: Calculate the largest square number less than or equal to 450.
To find the largest square number, we start by finding the square root of 450. The square root of 450 is approximately 21.213. This means the largest perfect square less than 450 is 21^2 = 441.

## Step 4: Determine the number of buttons in each row.
Since 441 is the largest perfect square less than 450, and we know that 9 buttons were left over, the arrangement must be a square with 21 buttons in each row, because 21 * 21 = 441.

## Step 5: Confirm that this arrangement leaves 9 buttons leftover.
If Sakir arranged the buttons in a 21x21 square, he would have used 441 buttons. Since he started with 450 buttons, 450 - 441 = 9 buttons would indeed be leftover.

The problem states that a train travels from Kamalapur station to Narayanganj station at a speed of 30 km/h. It is given that if the speed were 25 km/h, it would take 10 minutes more to cover the same distance.

## Step 2: Define the variables and establish the relationship between speed, time, and distance.
Let's denote the distance between the two stations as \(D\) km. The time taken to travel at 30 km/h is \(T_1 = \frac{D}{30}\) hours, and the time taken to travel at 25 km/h is \(T_2 = \frac{D}{25}\) hours.

## Step 3: Express the time difference in terms of the distance.
The time difference between traveling at 25 km/h and 30 km/h is given as 10 minutes, which is \(\frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6}\) hours. Therefore, we have \(T_2 - T_1 = \frac{D}{25} - \frac{D}{30} = \frac{1}{6}\).

## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the time difference.
To find \(D\), we set up the equation: \(\frac{D}{25} - \frac{D}{30} = \frac{1}{6}\).

## Step 5: Solve the equation for \(D\).
First, find a common denominator for \(\frac{D}{25}\) and \(\frac{D}{30}\), which is 150. Thus, the equation becomes \(\frac{6D}{150} - \frac{5D}{150} = \frac{1}{6}\).

Simplifying, we get \(\frac{D}{150} = \frac{1}{6}\).

Multiplying both sides by 150 to solve for \(D\), we get \(D = 150 \times \frac{1}{6} = 25\).

The problem states that the sum of two numbers is 18. Additionally, it mentions that if the smaller number is doubled, it is 6 more than the larger number. We need to find the value of the smaller number.

## Step 2: Define variables for the two numbers.
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y.

## Step 3: Set up equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The sum of the two numbers is 18, which gives us the equation: x + y = 18.
2. The smaller number doubled is 6 more than the larger number, leading to the equation: 2x = y + 6.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:
From the second equation, we can express y in terms of x: y = 2x - 6.
Now, substitute this expression for y into the first equation: x + (2x - 6) = 18.

## Step 5: Solve for x.
Simplifying the equation: x + 2x - 6 = 18, which gives us 3x - 6 = 18.
Adding 6 to both sides: 3x = 24.
Dividing both sides by 3: x = 8.

## Step 6: Verify the solution (optional but recommended for accuracy).
Substitute x = 8 back into one of the original equations to find y and verify that both conditions are met.
Using x + y = 18 and substituting x = 8: 8 + y = 18, which gives y = 10.
Then, check if 2x = y + 6 holds true: 2*8 = 10 + 6, which simplifies to 16 = 16. This verifies our solution.

The problem states: ""At a certain time, the profit-capital is 5600 rupees, and the profit is 2/5 of the capital. If the annual interest rate is 8%, determine the time period.""

## Step 2: Define the variables and given information
Let's denote the capital as C, the profit as P, and the time period as T (in years). We are given that P = 2/5 * C, P + C = 5600, and the annual interest rate is 8%.

## Step 3: Express the profit in terms of the capital and time period
We know that the simple interest formula is I = (P * R * T) / 100, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount (or capital), R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period. Here, the interest earned is the profit (P). So, we can write P = (C * 8 * T) / 100.

## Step 4: Use the given relationship between profit and capital to express capital in terms of profit
From the given information, P = 2/5 * C. Rearranging this equation gives C = (5/2) * P.

## Step 5: Substitute the expression for capital from step 4 into the equation from step 2
Substituting C = (5/2) * P into P + C = 5600 gives P + (5/2) * P = 5600. Simplifying, we get (7/2) * P = 5600.

## Step 6: Solve for profit
Solving the equation (7/2) * P = 5600 for P gives P = 5600 * (2/7) = 1600.

## Step 7: Find the capital using the profit
Now that we know P = 1600, we can find C using C = (5/2) * P = (5/2) * 1600 = 4000.

## Step 8: Use the interest formula to solve for the time period
Substituting the known values into the interest formula P = (C * 8 * T) / 100 gives 1600 = (4000 * 8 * T) / 100. Simplifying, we get 1600 = 320 * T.

The problem states that the length of a rectangular field is 1.5 times its width. The cost of laying grass on the field at a rate of 1.90 rupees per square meter is 10,260.00 rupees. We need to find the cost of fencing around the field at a rate of 2.50 rupees per meter.

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the field.
To find the area, we first need to determine the length and width of the field. Let's denote the width as W and the length as 1.5W. The area of the field is given by the formula: Area = length * width. We know that the cost of laying grass is 10,260.00 rupees at a rate of 1.90 rupees per square meter. So, we can calculate the area using the formula: Area = Total Cost / Rate per square meter.

## Step 3: Calculate the area using the given cost and rate.
Area = Total Cost / Rate per square meter = 10,260.00 / 1.90 = 5400 square meters.

## Step 4: Express the area in terms of width and length, and solve for the width.
We know that Area = length * width, and length = 1.5W. So, 5400 = 1.5W * W. This simplifies to 5400 = 1.5W^2.

## Step 5: Solve for the width (W).
To solve for W, we divide both sides by 1.5: W^2 = 5400 / 1.5 = 3600. Then, taking the square root of both sides gives us W = sqrt(3600) = 60 meters.

## Step 6: Calculate the length of the field.
Since the length is 1.5 times the width, Length = 1.5 * 60 = 90 meters.

## Step 7: Calculate the perimeter of the field.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Substituting the values, Perimeter = 2 * (90 + 60) = 2 * 150 = 300 meters.

## Step 8: Calculate the cost of fencing around the field.
The cost of fencing is given by the formula: Cost = Perimeter *"

The problem asks us to find the smallest perfect square number, excluding zero, that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60.

## Step 2: Find the prime factorization of the given numbers
To find the smallest perfect square number that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60, we first need to find the prime factorization of these numbers.
- 25 = 5^2
- 40 = 2^3 * 5
- 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5

## Step 3: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the given numbers
To ensure divisibility by 25, 40, and 60, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.
- The LCM of 25, 40, and 60 must include 2^3 (from 40), 3 (from 60), and 5^2 (from 25) to cover all prime factors.
- Thus, the LCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2 = 8 * 3 * 25 = 600.

## Step 4: Find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of the LCM
Since the LCM (600) itself may not be a perfect square, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 600.
- Prime factorization of 600 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2.
- To make it a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent. Therefore, we need to adjust the factors to have even exponents.
- Adjusted factorization for a perfect square = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 (to ensure even exponents for all prime factors).

## Step 5: Calculate the smallest perfect square number
Now, calculate the value of the adjusted factorization.
- Smallest perfect square = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 16 * 9 * 25 = 3600.

Monowara Begum borrowed some money at 6% interest rate and some money at 4% interest rate for her family needs. She borrowed a total of 56,000 rupees and eventually paid 2,840 rupees as interest. If 5% compound interest is applied on the entire loan, how much interest will Monowara Begum have to pay after 2 years?

## Step 2: Let's assume the amount borrowed at 6% interest rate is x and the amount borrowed at 4% interest rate is (56,000 - x).
We need to find the values of x and (56,000 - x) to calculate the interest paid.

## Step 3: Calculate the interest paid on the amount borrowed at 6% and 4% interest rates.
Interest paid on x at 6% = 0.06x, Interest paid on (56,000 - x) at 4% = 0.04(56,000 - x).

## Step 4: The total interest paid is 2,840 rupees, so we can set up the equation 0.06x + 0.04(56,000 - x) = 2,840.
Solving this equation will give us the value of x.

## Step 5: Expand the equation 0.06x + 0.04(56,000 - x) = 2,840.
0.06x + 2,240 - 0.04x = 2,840.

## Step 6: Combine like terms and solve for x.
0.02x = 2,840 - 2,240, 0.02x = 600, x = 600 / 0.02, x = 30,000.

## Step 7: Calculate the amount borrowed at 4% interest rate.
Amount borrowed at 4% = 56,000 - x = 56,000 - 30,000 = 26,000.

## Step 8: Calculate the interest paid after 2 years with 5% compound interest on the entire loan of 56,000 rupees.
Interest after 2 years = 56,000 * (1 + 0.05)^2 - 56,000.

The problem states that we have two positive perfect square numbers, and their product is 1576, while their quotient (or ratio) is 9/7. We need to find the larger number.

## Step 2: Express the problem mathematically.
Let's denote the two perfect square numbers as x^2 and y^2, where x^2 > y^2. According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. x^2 * y^2 = 1576
2. x^2 / y^2 = 9/7

## Step 3: Solve the equations to find x and y.
From the second equation, we can express x^2 in terms of y^2: x^2 = (9/7) * y^2.

## Step 4: Substitute x^2 from Step 3 into the first equation to find y^2.
Substituting x^2 = (9/7) * y^2 into the equation x^2 * y^2 = 1576 gives us: (9/7) * y^2 * y^2 = 1576. Simplifying this, we get (9/7) * y^4 = 1576.

## Step 5: Solve for y^4.
Multiplying both sides by 7/9 to isolate y^4 gives us y^4 = 1576 * (7/9).

## Step 6: Calculate y^4.
y^4 = 1576 * (7/9) = 1228.444... However, since we are dealing with perfect squares and the result must be a perfect fourth power, we revisit our calculation approach for accuracy.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate our approach for solving the equations.
Let's reconsider our method: given x^2 * y^2 = 1576 and x^2 / y^2 = 9/7, we should directly address the relationship between the two numbers through their factors.

## Step 8: Factor 1576 to understand its prime factors.
1576 can be factored into its prime factors to see if it helps in identifying the squares. 1576 = 2^4 * 7^2, indicating that 1576 is indeed a product of two perfect squares, since it can be expressed as a product of prime factors each raised to an even power.

The problem asks us to find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35.

## Step 2: Identify the least common multiple (LCM) of the given numbers.
To find the smallest four-digit number divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. The LCM of 12, 15, 20, and 35 will give us the smallest number that is divisible by all these numbers.

## Step 3: Calculate the LCM of 12, 15, 20, and 35.
First, let's break down each number into its prime factors:
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 20 = 2^2 * 5
- 35 = 5 * 7

## Step 4: Determine the LCM using the prime factors.
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number from the prime factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^2 (from 12 and 20).
- The highest power of 3 is 3 (from 12 and 15).
- The highest power of 5 is 5 (from 15, 20, and 35).
- The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 35).

## Step 5: Calculate the LCM.
LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420.

## Step 6: Find the smallest four-digit number divisible by the LCM.
The LCM (420) is less than 1000, so we need to find the smallest multiple of 420 that is a four-digit number. We divide 1000 by 420 to see how many times 420 goes into 1000 and then add 1 to find the next multiple:
1000 / 420 ≈ 2.38, so the next whole multiple of 420 after 1000 is 420 * 3 = 1260.

The final answer is: **1260**"

The problem states that the sum of two numbers is 160, and one number is three times the other. We need to find the larger number.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the two numbers.
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
Since one number is three times the other, we can write the equation as y = 3x.
Also, the sum of the two numbers is 160, so we can write another equation as x + y = 160.

## Step 4: Substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation.
Substituting y = 3x into the equation x + y = 160, we get x + 3x = 160, which simplifies to 4x = 160.

## Step 5: Solve for x.
Dividing both sides of the equation 4x = 160 by 4, we find x = 160 / 4 = 40.

## Step 6: Find the value of y using the relationship y = 3x.
Since y = 3x and x = 40, we can calculate y as y = 3 * 40 = 120.

## Step 7: Identify the larger number.
From the calculation, y = 120 is the larger number.

The final answer is: **120**"
448,৭৫ টাকায় ১৫ টি বলপেন কিনে ৯০ টাকায় বিক্রয় করলে শতকরা কত ভাগ লাভ হবে ?,২০,"## Step 1: Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity.
The problem translates to: ""If 15 ball pens are bought for 75 taka and sold for 90 taka, what percentage of profit will be made?""

## Step 2: Determine the cost price (CP) and selling price (SP) of the ball pens.
The cost price for 15 ball pens is 75 taka, so the cost price per ball pen is 75 / 15 = 5 taka. The selling price for 15 ball pens is 90 taka, so the selling price per ball pen is 90 / 15 = 6 taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the profit made per ball pen.
Profit per ball pen = Selling Price per ball pen - Cost Price per ball pen = 6 - 5 = 1 taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the total profit made from selling 15 ball pens.
Total profit = Profit per ball pen * Number of ball pens = 1 * 15 = 15 taka.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage profit.
Percentage profit = (Total profit / Total cost price) * 100 = (15 / 75) * 100 = 20%.

The final answer is: **20**"
