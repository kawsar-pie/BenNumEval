""A movie theater charges 7.50 for adults and 4.50 for children. The receipt for a movie show was 540. If 80 tickets were sold, then _____ adult tickets were sold.""

Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as A and the number of children tickets sold as C. We have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of tickets sold: A + C = 80
2. The total amount of money earned: 7.50A + 4.50C = 540

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of A.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 4.50 to help eliminate C when we subtract it from the second equation:
4.50(A + C) = 4.50 * 80
4.50A + 4.50C = 360

Now, subtract this equation from the second equation to solve for A:
(7.50A + 4.50C) - (4.50A + 4.50C) = 540 - 360
3.00A = 180

Divide both sides by 3.00 to solve for A:
A = 180 / 3.00
A = 60

Therefore, the number of adult tickets sold is 60.

The problem states that 12 generators run for 6 hours a day will consume the fuel reserve in 7 days. We can set up an equation to represent the fuel consumption rate:

12 generators * 6 hours/day * 7 days = Total fuel reserve consumption

Now, if the generators are run for 4 hours a day, we want to find out how many generators can be run for 9 days on the same fuel reserve. Let's denote the number of generators as ""G"". The equation representing this scenario is:

G generators * 4 hours/day * 9 days = Total fuel reserve consumption

Since the total fuel reserve consumption remains constant, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

12 * 6 * 7 = G * 4 * 9

Simplifying both sides:

504 = 36G

Now, divide both sides by 36 to solve for G:

G = 504 / 36
G = 14

Therefore, if the generators are run for 4 hours a day, 14 generators can be run!

Translation: A 55-meter long bamboo has 11 meters submerged in mud and water. What percentage of the bamboo is above the mud and water?

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the bamboo that is above the mud and water.

Total length of the bamboo = 55 meters
Length of the bamboo submerged in mud and water = 11 meters
Length of the bamboo above the mud and water = Total length - Submerged length
= 55 meters - 11 meters
= 44 meters

Percentage of the bamboo above the mud and water = (Length above the mud and water / Total length) * 100
= (44 meters / 55 meters) * 100
= 80%

Therefore, the percentage of the bamboo that is above the mud and water is 80%.

""An rectangular room has a perimeter equal to a square room. The length of the rectangular room is 3 times its width. At a rate of 75 taka per square meter, it costs 11025 taka to carpet the floor of the room. What is the length of the rectangular room in meters?""

Let's denote the width of the rectangular room as W and its length as L. Since the length is 3 times the width, we have L = 3W.

The perimeter of the rectangular room is 2L + 2W, and it's given that this is equal to the perimeter of a square room. However, to use the information about the cost and the rate per square meter, we need to consider the area of the room, not just the perimeter. The area of the room, which is the same as the area that needs to be carpeted, is given by L * W.

The cost of carpeting is 75 taka per square meter, and the total cost is 11025 taka. This allows us to set up an equation based on the area:

75 * (L * W) = 11025

Since we know L = 3W, we can substitute this into the equation:

75 * (3W * W) = 11025
75 * 3W^2 = 11025
225W^2 = 11025

Now, divide both sides by 225:

W^2 = 11025 / 225
W^2 = 49

Taking the square root of both sides gives us:

W = 7

Since L = 3W, we substitute W = 7 into this equation:

L = 3 * 7
L = 21

Therefore, the length of the rectangular room is 21 meters.

What is the minimum number of saplings sent by the Panchayat?""

Now, let's solve this problem:

To have an equal number of saplings in each row when planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30, the total number of saplings must be divisible by 20, 24, and 30. 

The least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 24, and 30 can be calculated as follows:
- The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5.
- The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3.
- The prime factorization of 30 is 2 * 3 * 5.

Combining the highest powers of all prime numbers from these factorizations, we get:
LCM(20, 24, 30) = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120.

So, the minimum number of saplings sent by the Panchayat is 120.

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""I have 22 meters of yellow ribbon, 24.75 meters of orange ribbon, and 16.50 meters of green ribbon. I want to cut the largest possible pieces from each of these three ribbons so that I get the same number of pieces from each ribbon, and no ribbon is wasted. The length of each piece will be _____ meters.""

Now, let's find the GCD of the lengths:
- Yellow ribbon: 22 meters
- Green ribbon: 24.75 meters
- Orange ribbon: 16.50 meters

To find the GCD, we can break down the numbers into their factors or use the Euclidean algorithm. However, given the numbers, it might be easier to look for common factors directly, especially considering that we're dealing with meters and potentially looking for a straightforward measurement that can be easily divided from each ribbon.

Breaking down the numbers:
- 22 = 2 * 11
- 24.75 = 24 3/4 = (99/4) = 3 * 3 * 11 / 4
- 16.50 = 16 1/2 = (33/2) = 3 * 11 / 2

Looking at these, 11 is a common factor among all three, which could potentially be our GCD in terms of whole numbers, given that both 24.75 and 16.50 can be divided into parts that include 11 as a factor when considering their fractional forms.

To simplify, we are looking for the highest number that divides all three lengths without a remainder. Given the presence of 11 as a factor in all, let's see how it applies:
- 22 meters / 11 = 2
- 24.75 meters / 11 = 2.25 (since we can have fractions of a meter, this works)
- 16.50 meters / 11 = 1.5 (again, fractions of a meter are possible)

However, to ensure no ribbon is wasted and we get whole pieces from each, we need a length that can be evenly divided from each ribbon. Given that 11 is the common factor that appears directly or indirectly in each, we check if"

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
Mr. Ray, a government official, will go to India for a pilgrimage. If 1 Bangladeshi Taka is equal to 0.63 Indian Rupees, then how many Bangladeshi Taka will be needed for 3000 Indian Rupees?

2. To find out how many Bangladeshi Taka are equivalent to 3000 Indian Rupees, we need to use the exchange rate.

Given exchange rate: 1 BDT = 0.63 INR

We need to find how many BDT = 3000 INR

To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.63 to find out how many BDT equals 1 INR:
1 BDT = 0.63 INR
1 INR = 1 / 0.63 BDT
1 INR ≈ 1.5873 BDT

Now, to find out how many BDT are equivalent to 3000 INR, we multiply 3000 by the number of BDT per INR:
3000 INR * 1.5873 BDT/INR ≈ 4761.9 BDT

1. The conversion factor between inches and centimeters is given as 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters.
2. The conversion factor between acres and square yards is given as 1 acre = 4840 square yards.

First, we need to convert square yards into square meters because we are asked to find out how many square meters are in one acre. To do this, we need to know that 1 yard = 3 feet and 1 foot = 12 inches. 

Given that 1 inch = 2.54 cm, we can calculate that:
- 1 foot = 12 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 30.48 cm
- Since 1 meter = 100 cm, 1 foot = 30.48 cm = 0.3048 meters
- Therefore, 1 yard = 3 feet * 0.3048 meters/foot = 0.9144 meters

Now, to find the area in square meters:
- 1 square yard = (0.9144 meters)^2 = 0.83612736 square meters

Given that 1 acre = 4840 square yards, we can convert acres to square meters:
- 1 acre = 4840 square yards * 0.83612736 square meters/square yard ≈ 4046.8564224 square meters

Rounding this off for practical purposes, we can approximate the number of square meters in one acre.

The translation of the problem is: ""If we subtract a certain amount from half of 150, we will have 30 left.""

Now, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, find half of 150: 150 / 2 = 75.
2. The problem states that if we subtract a certain amount from this half (75), we will have 30 left.
3. So, we set up the equation: 75 - x = 30, where x is the amount we are trying to find.
4. To find x, we rearrange the equation: x = 75 - 30.

"" Fifteen trees are planted at equal distances along a 24-meter long road, including both ends of the road. The distance between two consecutive trees is _____ meters.""

Now, let's solve the problem. Since there are 15 trees and the distance between them is equal, we can divide the total length of the road by the number of gaps between the trees. There are 14 gaps between 15 trees. 

So, the distance between two consecutive trees = total length of the road / number of gaps between the trees
= 24 meters / 14
= 1.7143 meters (approximately)

However, the question asks for an exact numerical value. Given the information and usual context, the calculation should result in a whole number or a simple fraction, considering the original problem might imply a simpler, integer-based solution. If we re-evaluate the approach, recognizing that the trees are at the ends and in between, dividing the road into equal parts for 15 trees (thus 14 intervals) should indeed directly give us the distance between each tree without needing an approximation for this step.

The final calculation should directly utilize the division of the total length by the number of intervals, which is:
24 meters / 14 = 1.7142857 meters, but for simplicity and assuming the answer seeks a whole number or is rounding to a nearest whole number as typically found in such problems, it might have been anticipated to result in a simpler fraction or whole number. However, the precise calculation yields 24/14, which simplifies to 12/7 meters.

Thus, the distance between two consecutive trees, maintaining the precision of the calculation, is exactly 12/7 meters.

Now, let's solve the problem:

150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the two trees was 2961 years. Let's denote the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago as x. Then, the age of the Pine tree 150 years ago would be 2961 - x.

Since the current age of the Pine tree is 1432 years, 150 years ago, it was 1432 - 150 = 1282 years old. 

So, we can set up the equation:
x + 1282 = 2961

Solving for x:
x = 2961 - 1282
x = 1679

This means that 150 years ago, the Banyan tree was 1679 years old. Now, to find its current age:
Current age of Banyan tree = 1679 + 150 = 1829 years

Now, we can find the current sum of the ages of the two trees:
Current sum = Current age of Banyan tree + Current age of Pine tree
= 1829 + 1432
= 3261

Therefore, the current sum of the ages of the two trees is 3261 years.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a fish seller buys hilsa fish for 1600 Taka each and sells them for 350 Taka each. We are asked to find the percentage of profit or loss.

2. **Solution:**
- **Cost Price (CP) per fish:** 1600 Taka
- **Selling Price (SP) per fish:** 350 Taka

Since the Selling Price (350 Taka) is less than the Cost Price (1600 Taka), there is a loss.

The loss per fish can be calculated as:
Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price = 1600 - 350 = 1250 Taka

To find the percentage loss, we use the formula:
Percentage Loss = (Loss / Cost Price) * 100
= (1250 / 1600) * 100
= 0.78125 * 100
= 78.125%

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states that there is a rectangular garden with a length of 80 meters and a width of 60 meters. Inside this garden, there is a path that is 4 meters wide surrounding the garden on all sides. We need to find the cost of paving this path at a rate of 7.25 rupees per square meter.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Calculate the area of the larger rectangle (including the path):
Length (L1) = 80 + 2*4 = 88 meters
Width (W1) = 60 + 2*4 = 68 meters
Area of the larger rectangle = L1 * W1 = 88 * 68 = 5994 square meters

2. Calculate the area of the garden (excluding the path):
Length (L2) = 80 meters
Width (W2) = 60 meters
Area of the garden = L2 * W2 = 80 * 60 = 4800 square meters

3. Calculate the area of the path:
Area of the path = Area of the larger rectangle - Area of the garden
= 5994 - 4800
= 1194 square meters

4. Calculate the cost of paving the path:
Cost per square meter = 7.25 rupees
Total cost = Area of the path * Cost per square meter
= 1194 * 7.25
= 8655 rupees

Therefore, the cost of paving the path around the garden is:

1. Translation of the problem:
The problem states that on a certain day, 20 kg and 850 grams of mustard were produced on a piece of land. We need to find out how much mustard would be produced on seven similar pieces of land.

2. Solution:
First, we convert the total amount of mustard produced on one piece of land into kilograms. Since 1 kg = 1000 grams, 850 grams is 0.85 kg. 
So, the total mustard produced on one piece of land = 20 kg + 0.85 kg = 20.85 kg.

Now, we calculate the total amount of mustard produced on seven similar pieces of land:
Total production = 20.85 kg * 7 = 146.95 kg.

Therefore, the total amount of mustard produced on seven pieces of land would be approximately 146.95 kg.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Convert the width of the field into meters: 32 meters 80 centimeters = 32 + (80/100) meters = 32.8 meters.

2. Calculate the total area of the field including the road:
   - Length of the field including the road = 48 meters + 2 * 3 meters = 54 meters.
   - Width of the field including the road = 32.8 meters + 2 * 3 meters = 38.8 meters.
   - Area of the field including the road = 54 meters * 38.8 meters = 2095.2 square meters.

3. Calculate the area of the field itself:
   - Area of the field = 48 meters * 32.8 meters = 1574.4 square meters.

4. Calculate the area of the road:
   - Area of the road = Area of the field including the road - Area of the field = 2095.2 square meters - 1574.4 square meters = 520.8 square meters.

Therefore, the area of the road is 520.8 square meters.

""At the rate of interest at which Rs. 6500 amounts to Rs. 8840 in 4 years, at the same rate of interest, what amount will amount to Rs. 10200 in 4 years?""

Now, to find the rate of interest or to solve for the unknown principal amount that will yield Rs. 10200 in 4 years at the same interest rate, we first determine the interest earned on Rs. 6500 over 4 years. 

Interest = Amount - Principal = 8840 - 6500 = Rs. 2340

Since this interest is earned over 4 years, we can find the annual interest:
Annual Interest = Total Interest / Number of Years = 2340 / 4 = Rs. 585

Now, to find the rate of interest (r), we use the formula for simple interest:
Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

Rearranging for Rate gives us:
Rate = (100 * Interest) / (Principal * Time)

Substituting the known values for the first scenario:
Rate = (100 * 2340) / (6500 * 4) = 234000 / 26000 = 9

So, the rate of interest is 9%.

Now, we are asked to find the principal amount that will yield Rs. 10200 in 4 years at the same 9% interest rate. 

Let P be the principal amount we are solving for. The total interest earned in this case would be:
Interest = Amount - Principal = 10200 - P

We know that over 4 years at 9% interest, the interest earned is:
Interest = (P * 9 * 4) / 100

Since the amount is Rs. 10200 after 4 years, we set up the equation:
P + (P * 9 * 4 / 100) = 10200

Simplifying, we get:
P + 0.36P = 10200
1.36P = 10200

Dividing both sides by 1.36 gives:
P = 10200 / 1.36
P = 7500

Therefore, the principal amount that will yield Rs. 10200 in 4 years at the same interest rate is Rs. 7500.

Now, let's calculate the reduction in sugar consumption. 
4% of 625 grams = (4/100) * 625 = 25 grams.

So, the reduction in sugar consumption will be 25 grams per day. 
To find out how much sugar will be used per day after the reduction, subtract the reduction from the current consumption:
625 grams - 25 grams = 600 grams.

Therefore, after the reduction, we will use 600 grams of sugar per day.

""15 vans can haul 75 quintals of vegetables in 40 minutes. 20 vans will take _____ time to haul 100 quintals of vegetables.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the rate at which 15 vans can haul vegetables:
   - 15 vans haul 75 quintals in 40 minutes.
   - So, the rate per van can be found by dividing the total quintals by the number of vans and then by the time taken: 
   - Rate per van = 75 quintals / (15 vans * 40 minutes) = 75 / 600 = 0.125 quintals per van per minute.

2. Calculate the combined rate of 20 vans:
   - Combined rate of 20 vans = 0.125 quintals per van per minute * 20 vans = 2.5 quintals per minute.

3. Find the time it takes for 20 vans to haul 100 quintals:
   - Time = Total quintals / Combined rate = 100 quintals / 2.5 quintals per minute = 40 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 20 vans the same amount of time to haul 100 quintals as it took 15 vans to haul 75 quintals, given the proportional increase in both the number of vans and the amount of vegetables.

""10 years ago, the ratio of the father's and son's ages was 4:1. 10 years later, the ratio of the father's and son's ages will be 2:1. The father's current age is _____ years.""

Let's denote the current age of the father as F and the current age of the son as S.

10 years ago, their ages were F - 10 and S - 10, respectively. According to the given ratio, we have:
(F - 10) / (S - 10) = 4 / 1
F - 10 = 4(S - 10)
F - 10 = 4S - 40
F = 4S - 30  ... (Equation 1)

10 years later, their ages will be F + 10 and S + 10, respectively. According to the given ratio, we have:
(F + 10) / (S + 10) = 2 / 1
F + 10 = 2(S + 10)
F + 10 = 2S + 20
F = 2S + 10  ... (Equation 2)

Now, we can equate Equation 1 and Equation 2 to solve for S:
4S - 30 = 2S + 10
2S = 40
S = 20

Now that we know the son's current age, we can find the father's current age by substituting S into either Equation 1 or Equation 2:
F = 4S - 30
F = 4(20) - 30
F = 80 - 30
F = 50

Alternatively, using Equation 2:
F = 2S + 10
F = 2(20) + 10
F = 40 + 10
F = 50

Therefore, the father's current age is 50 years.

A perfect square number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself. For a number to be a perfect square, all the prime factors' exponents must be even.

The prime factorization of 17 is simply 17, as it is a prime number. For 17 to be a factor of a perfect square, it must appear in a pair (since its exponent needs to be even for the number to be a perfect square).

Thus, the smallest perfect square number that includes 17 as a factor would be \(17 \times 17 = 289\), because this ensures that 17 appears with an even exponent.

Therefore, the smallest perfect square number with 17 as a factor is 289.

""A rectangular room has a perimeter equal to that of a square room. The length of the rectangular room is three times its width. At a rate of 75 taka per square meter, it costs 11,025 taka to carpet the floor of the room. How many 40 square centimeter tiles will be needed to cover the floor of the square room?""

Now, let's denote the width of the rectangular room as W and the side length of the square room as S.

Given that the length of the rectangular room is three times its width, the length = 3W.

The perimeter of the rectangular room is 2(length + width) = 2(3W + W) = 8W.

The perimeter of the square room is 4S.

Since the perimeters are equal, we have:
8W = 4S
S = 2W

The area of the rectangular room is length * width = 3W * W = 3W^2.

The cost of carpeting the floor is 11,025 taka at a rate of 75 taka per square meter. So, the area of the floor is:
11,025 / 75 = 147 square meters

Since 1 square meter = 10,000 square centimeters, the area in square centimeters is:
147 * 10,000 = 1,470,000 square centimeters

Now, we equate this to 3W^2:
3W^2 = 1,470,000
W^2 = 490,000
W = sqrt(490,000) = 700 (since we are dealing with lengths, we take the positive root)

Now, we find S:
S = 2W = 2 * 700 = 1400

The area of the square room is S^2 = 1400^2 = 1,960,000 square centimeters

Each tile covers 40 square centimeters. To find the number of tiles needed:
1,960,000 / 40 = 49,000

Therefore, the number of tiles needed to cover the floor of the square room is 49,000.

""The sum of the ages of the mother and son is 60 years. The mother's age is three times the son's age. Then, the mother's age is _____ years.""

Let's denote the son's age as S and the mother's age as M. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The sum of their ages is 60 years, so we have: M + S = 60.
2. The mother's age is three times the son's age, so we have: M = 3S.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for S:
3S + S = 60
4S = 60
S = 60 / 4
S = 15

Now that we know the son's age, we can find the mother's age by substituting S back into one of the equations:
M = 3S
M = 3 * 15
M = 45

Therefore, the mother's age is 45 years.

1. Translation of the problem into English: 
""A board of 3/4 square meters can be colored with 1 deci liter of paint. How many square meters can be colored with 4 deci liters of paint?""

2. Solution:
Given that 1 deci liter (0.1 liters, but for the context of the question, we'll stick with the proportion given) of paint covers 3/4 square meters, we can establish a ratio to find out how much area 4 deci liters of paint will cover.

The given ratio is 1 deci liter : 3/4 square meters.

To find the area covered by 4 deci liters, we multiply both sides of the ratio by 4:
4 deci liters : (3/4) * 4 square meters.

Simplifying, we get:
4 deci liters : 3 square meters.

Therefore, 4 deci liters of paint can cover 3 square meters.

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The total monthly expense for food in our family is 4750 taka, and other expenses are 5900 taka. If the food expense increases by 10% and other expenses decrease by 16%, then the total monthly expense will decrease by _____ taka.""

Now, let's calculate the changes:
- Increase in food expense: 10% of 4750 = 0.1 * 4750 = 475 taka
- New! food expense: 4750 + 475 = 5225 taka
- Decrease in other expenses: 16% of 5900 = 0.16 * 5900 = 944 taka
- New other expenses: 5900 - 944 = 4956 taka

Original total monthly expense: 4750 + 5900 = 10650 taka
New total monthly expense: 5225 + 4956 = 10181 taka

Decrease in total monthly expense: 10650 - 10181 = 469 taka

""The sum of three numbers is 5452. Two of the numbers are 2563 and 1245. What is the third number?""

Now, let's solve the problem. We know that the sum of the three numbers is 5452, and two of the numbers are 2563 and 1245. To find the third number, we subtract the sum of the two known numbers from the total sum.

Sum of the two known numbers = 2563 + 1245 = 3808

Now, let's subtract this sum from the total sum to find the third number:
Third number = Total sum - Sum of the two known numbers
Third number = 5452 - 3808
Third number = 1644

Therefore, the third number is 1644.

""Shyamal Chakma took a loan of 4500 taka from a bank. An annual interest of 8% is applied to the principal amount. After 10 years, he will have to repay a total of _____ taka.""

Now, to find the total amount Shyamal needs to repay, we can use the formula for simple interest:
Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) * Rate (R) * Time (T)

Here, 
P = 4500 taka
R = 8% = 0.08
T = 10 years

SI = 4500 * 0.08 * 10
SI = 3600

The total amount to be repaid is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:
Total Amount = P + SI
Total Amount = 4500 + 3600
Total Amount = 8100

Therefore, Shyamal will have to repay a total of 8100 taka after 10 years.

First, let's translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""Habiba and Halima can do a job together in 20 days. After Habiba and Halima worked together for 8 days, Habiba left. Halima finished the remaining work in 21 days. The whole work Habiba could have done in ______ days.""

Now, let's break down the solution:

Let's assume the total work is 1 unit. 
Habiba and Halima's combined work rate is 1/20 units per day, since they can finish the work together in 20 days.

In 8 days, Habiba and Halima completed 8 * (1/20) = 2/5 units of work together.

So, the remaining work is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5 units.

Halima finished the remaining 3/5 units of work in 21 days. 
Therefore, Halima's work rate is (3/5) / 21 = 3/105 = 1/35 units per day.

Now, let's find Habiba's work rate. 
We know that Habiba and Halima's combined work rate is 1/20 units per day, and Halima's work rate is 1/35 units per day.

So, Habiba's work rate is (1/20) - (1/35) = (7-4)/140 = 3/140 units per day.

Since Habiba's work rate is 3/140 units per day, she can finish the whole work (1 unit) in 1/(3/140) = 140/3 days.

Therefore, Habiba could have done the whole work in 140/3 days.

Translation: At a percent annual profit of 8 1/2 percent, the profit on _____ rupees for 6 years will be 2550 rupees.

Now, let's solve the problem. The formula for simple interest (which seems to be what's implied here, though the term ""profit"" is used) is:

Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
- Rate = 8 1/2 percent = 8.5% = 0.085 (in decimal form)
- Time = 6 years
- Simple Interest = 2550 rupees

We need to find the Principal (P).

Rearranging the formula to solve for Principal:
Principal = Simple Interest / (Rate * Time)

Substituting the given values:
Principal = 2550 / (0.085 * 6)

First, calculate the denominator:
0.085 * 6 = 0.51

Then, calculate the Principal:
Principal = 2550 / 0.51

Performing the division:
Principal = 5000

Therefore, the amount of money that, with an annual profit of 8 1/2 percent, yields a profit of 2550 rupees over 6 years is 5000 rupees.

- Seven crore = 7,000,000 (7 * 10^6)
- Ninety-nine lakh = 99,00,000 (99 * 10^5)
- Thirty-three thousand = 33,000
- One hundred = 100

Total amount in taka = 7,000,000 + 99,00,000 + 33,000 + 100
Total amount in taka = 7,990,333,100 taka (since 7 crore = 70,000,000 and when adding it to 99 lakh which is 9,900,000 and then the rest, we get 79,933,100 but given the context and usual representation of such large numbers in Bengal or Indian numbering system, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in translation. Typically, ""seven crore ninety-nine lakh thirty-three thousand one hundred"" directly translates to 7,99,33,100. Therefore, correcting the calculation based on standard numerical representation in this context:
Total amount in taka = 7,99,33,100

Since 1 dollar = 100 taka,
The total amount in dollars = Total amount in taka / 100

If they stand inside the square, it will no longer be a square. Today, 40 people are present in our class. In each row of this square arrangement, _____ people are standing.""

Now, let's solve the problem. We know that the total number of people present is 40, and after forming the square, 4 people are left outside. This means that the number of people inside the square is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since the people are standing in a square shape, the number of people in each row must be the same, and the total number of people inside the square must be a perfect square. The closest perfect square to 36 is 36 itself, which is 6^2.

Therefore, the number of people in each row of the square arrangement is 6.

""A train travels from Kamalapur Station to Narayanganj Station at a speed of 30 km/h. If the speed were 25 km/h, it would take 10 minutes more. What is the distance between the two stations?""

Now, let's denote the distance between the two stations as D km. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

At 30 km/h, the time taken to cover the distance D is D / 30 hours.

At 25 km/h, the time taken to cover the distance D is D / 25 hours.

The problem states that at 25 km/h, it would take 10 minutes more, which is equivalent to 10/60 = 1/6 hours.

So, we can set up the equation:

D / 25 - D / 30 = 1/6

To solve for D, we can find a common denominator (150) and simplify:

(6D - 5D) / 150 = 1/6

D / 150 = 1/6

D = 150 * (1/6)

D = 25

Translation: Some of their friends joined them in the garden work. Now, the total number of people, each contributing an amount equal to the number of people times 5 taka, collected a total of 720 taka. By calculating, we find that they collected the contribution with a total of _____ friends.

Let's denote the total number of friends as 'x'. Since each friend contributes an amount equal to the number of friends times 5 taka, the total contribution can be represented as x * (x * 5) = 720.

This equation simplifies to 5x^2 = 720.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5, resulting in x^2 = 144.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = √144, which equals 12.

Therefore, the total number of friends who collected the contribution is 12.

A perfect square has all its prime factors raised to even powers.

The prime factorization of 7 is simply 7, since 7 is a prime number. To make the product a perfect square, we need to ensure that the prime factor 7 is raised to an even power. Currently, it's raised to the power of 1. Therefore, we need another factor of 7 to make it 7^2, which is a perfect square.

Thus, the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 7, results in a perfect square is 7 itself, because 7 * 7 = 49, and 49 is a perfect square (7^2).

""An orange seller buys oranges at 1000 taka per hundred and sells them at 1200 taka per hundred. His profit is _____ taka.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

The seller buys 100 oranges for 1000 taka, so the cost price per orange is 1000 / 100 = 10 taka.

He sells 100 oranges for 1200 taka, so the selling price per orange is 1200 / 100 = 12 taka.

The profit per orange is the selling price per orange minus the cost price per orange, which is 12 - 10 = 2 taka.

Since he bought and sold 100 oranges, his total profit is 2 taka per orange * 100 oranges = 200 taka.

Therefore, the seller's profit is 200 taka.

""Which is the smallest perfect square number divisible by 9, 15, and 25. The number is _______.""

Now, let's break down the problem. To find the smallest perfect square number that is divisible by 9, 15, and 25, we need to consider the prime factorization of these numbers:

- 9 = 3^2
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 25 = 5^2

For a number to be divisible by 9, 15, and 25, it must include their highest powers of prime factors. Thus, it needs to have 3^2 (from 9), 3 (from 15), and 5^2 (from 25) in its factorization. However, since we are looking for the smallest perfect square, we need to ensure that all prime factors are raised to even powers. The factor 3 appears as 3^2 from 9, which is already an even power. The factor 5 appears as 5^2 from 25, which is also an even power. Since 15 contributes a single factor of 3 and a single factor of 5, and the 3 is already accounted for in an even power from the factor 9, we just need to ensure that the factor of 5 from 15 is complemented to make it an even power, but 25 already provides 5^2.

Thus, combining these, the smallest perfect square number divisible by 9, 15, and 25 must include at least 3^2 * 5^2 in its prime factorization, which equals 9 * 25 = 225.

Therefore, the smallest perfect square number divisible by 9, 15, and 25 is indeed 225, since 225 = 15^2, fulfilling the condition of being a perfect square.

""Two-digit number whose sum of digits is 10 and difference of digits is 4, the largest possible number of this kind will be _____.""

Now, let's denote the tens digit as x and the units digit as y. We have two equations based on the given conditions:

1. x + y = 10 (sum of digits is 10)
2. x - y = 4 (difference of digits is 4)

We can solve these equations to find the values of x and y.

From equation 2, we can express x as x = y + 4.

Substituting x in equation 1, we get:
y + 4 + y = 10
Combine like terms:
2y + 4 = 10
Subtract 4 from both sides:
2y = 6
Divide by 2:
y = 3

Now, substitute y = 3 back into x = y + 4:
x = 3 + 4
x = 7

So, the tens digit x is 7 and the units digit y is 3, making the two-digit number 73.

Therefore, the largest possible number of this kind is 73.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that the interest earned on 500 Taka at a 6% annual interest rate for 4 years is equal to the interest earned on a certain amount at a 5% annual interest rate for 2 years and 6 months. We are asked to find this certain amount.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem:**
- First, calculate the interest earned on 500 Taka at 6% per annum for 4 years.
- Then, use this interest amount to find out the principal amount that would yield the same interest at 5% per annum for 2 years and 6 months.

3. **Calculating Interest for the First Scenario:**
\[ \text{Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]
Where:
- \( P = 500 \) Taka,
- \( R = 6\% \),
- \( T = 4 \) years.

\[ \text{Interest} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} = \frac{12000}{100} = 120 \text{ Taka} \]

4. **Finding the Principal for the Second Scenario:**
Given that the interest is 120 Taka, the rate \( R = 5\% \), and the time \( T = 2 \) years and 6 months (which is \( 2.5 \) years), we can rearrange the interest formula to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{\text{Interest} \times 100}{R \times T} \]

\[ P = \frac{120 \times 100}{5 \times 2.5} \]

\[ P = \frac{12000}{12.5} \]

\[ P = 960 \text{ Taka} \]

So, the amount that would yield 120 Taka interest at 5% per annum for 2 years and 6 months is 960 Taka.

""Smallest perfect square number which is divisible by 10, 15, 20, and 30 excluding zero is _____.""

Next, let's find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 10, 15, 20, and 30 since the number must be divisible by all these.

- The prime factorization of these numbers is as follows:
  - 10 = 2 * 5
  - 15 = 3 * 5
  - 20 = 2^2 * 5
  - 30 = 2 * 3 * 5

- To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
  - LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60

So, the smallest perfect square that is divisible by 10, 15, 20, and 30 must include at least the prime factors of 60. However, for it to be a perfect square, each prime factor must appear an even number of times. 

- Since 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, we need one more 3 and one more 5 to make each prime factor appear an even number of times:
  - Thus, the smallest perfect square divisible by 10, 15, 20, and 30 is (2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2) = 4 * 9 * 25 = 900.

Therefore, the final answer is:

""If 5 is added to the numerator of a fraction, its value becomes 2. Again, if 1 is subtracted from the denominator, its value becomes 1. What is the fraction?""

Let's denote the numerator of the fraction as 'x' and the denominator as 'y'. The original fraction is x/y.

According to the given conditions:
1. When 5 is added to the numerator, the fraction becomes (x+5)/y = 2.
2. When 1 is subtracted from the denominator, the fraction becomes x/(y-1) = 1.

From the first equation, we have:
(x+5)/y = 2
x + 5 = 2y
x = 2y - 5  ... (Equation 1)

From the second equation, we have:
x/(y-1) = 1
x = y - 1  ... (Equation 2)

Equating Equation 1 and Equation 2:
2y - 5 = y - 1
2y - y = -1 + 5
y = 4

Substituting y = 4 into Equation 2:
x = y - 1
x = 4 - 1
x = 3

So, the fraction is 3/4.

The current population of a city is 80 lakhs (8 million). The population growth rate of the city is 30 per thousand. We need to find the population of the city after 3 years.

2. **Solution:**
First, let's convert the growth rate into a percentage. The growth rate is 30 per thousand, which means 3% (since 30 per 1000 is the same as 3 per 100).

The formula to calculate the future population based on the current population and growth rate is:
\[ \text{Future Population} = \text{Current Population} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Current Population = 80 lakhs = 8,000,000
- Growth Rate = 3% or 0.03 (as a decimal)
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging the values into the formula:
\[ \text{Future Population} = 8,000,000 \times (1 + 0.03)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Population} = 8,000,000 \times (1.03)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Population} = 8,000,000 \times 1.092727 \]
\[ \text{Future Population} \approx 8,741,816 \]

Therefore, after 3 years, the population of the city will be approximately 8,741,816.

Translation: At an annual interest rate of 8.50 percent compounded annually, the compound interest on Rs. 10,000 for 2 years is _____ rupees.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 10,000
Annual interest rate (r) = 8.50%
Time (n) = 2 years

The formula for compound interest is:
A = P(1 + r/100)^n

Where A is the amount after n years, including interest.

Plugging the given values into the formula:
A = 10000(1 + 8.50/100)^2
A = 10000(1 + 0.085)^2
A = 10000(1.085)^2
A = 10000 * 1.177225
A = 11772.25

Now, to find the compound interest (CI), we subtract the principal from the amount:
CI = A - P
CI = 11772.25 - 10000
CI = 1772.25

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Total road to be built: 371/15 km
2. Total days allocated: 33 days
3. Work done in 25 days: 11/15 km/day * 25 days = (11/15) * 25 km = 181/15 km (approximately 12.07 km) but to keep the fractions, let's continue with the fraction form.
4. Remaining road to be built: 371/15 km - 181/15 km = 190/15 km
5. Remaining days: 33 days - 25 days = 8 days

Now, to find out how much road they need to build per day for the remaining days, we divide the remaining road by the remaining days:
190/15 km / 8 days = (190/15) / 8 km/day = 190/120 km/day = 19/12 km/day

When a boat moves upstream (against the current), its effective speed decreases due to the opposition from the water flow. The formula to calculate the effective speed of the boat when moving upstream is: effective speed = speed of the boat - speed of the current.

Given that the boat travels 77 km in 11 hours upstream, we can calculate its effective speed upstream as follows:
Effective speed upstream = Total distance / Total time = 77 km / 11 hours = 7 km/h.

We are also given that the speed of the boat in still water is 9 km/h. Using the formula mentioned above, we can set up the equation:
9 km/h (speed of the boat) - x km/h (speed of the current) = 7 km/h (effective speed upstream).

Solving for x, we get:
9 - x = 7
x = 9 - 7
x = 2 km/h.

Therefore, the speed of the current is 2 km/h.

""Annual percentage _____ rupees profit, some principal in 8 years will be 18850 rupees in profit-interest.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we need to understand that the profit-interest (or simple interest) is calculated using the formula:
I = PRT

where:
I = interest (or profit)
P = principal (initial amount)
R = annual interest rate (in decimal form, so 5% becomes 0.05)
T = time the money is invested for (in years)

We are given:
I = 18850 rupees
T = 8 years
We need to find R (the annual percentage).

However, we also need the principal (P) to calculate R. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't directly give us P, but we can rearrange the formula to express P in terms of I, R, and T:
P = I / (R * T)

But without a direct value for either P or R, we seem stuck. Yet, considering the nature of the question, which is asking for the rate (R) that would make the given condition true, and given no other information about P, we might need to approach this differently.

Let's assume the principal is P. The formula for simple interest is:
I = P * R * T

Given I = 18850 and T = 8, we have:
18850 = P * R * 8

Without the principal, we cannot solve for R directly. However, we can express R in terms of P:
R = 18850 / (P * 8)

Since we're looking for a percentage and we don't have the principal's value, let's consider how the question might be approached with typical values or assumptions. 

In problems like these, if we're missing a piece of information (like the principal), we might be expected to recognize a common or simple relationship, or there might be an assumption we're supposed to make that isn't directly stated. 

Given we can't solve for R without more information (like P), and no standard or easy-to-spot relationship jumps out without more context (like a common interest rate or principal amount that's implied but not stated), we're at a bit of a standstill for providing a numerical answer based on the information provided.

However, let's consider an approach where we might use a bit of algebra to frame an answer,"

Now, to find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost price and subtract it from the selling price.

The cost price of the motorcycle = 70,000 rupees
Registration cost = 1,500 rupees
Repair cost = 800 rupees
Total cost price = Cost price of the motorcycle + Registration cost + Repair cost
= 70,000 + 1,500 + 800

""A wholesale seller and a retail seller both make a 20% profit on the sale of a product. If the retail selling price of the product is 576 rupees, then what is the wholesale seller's cost price?""

Let's denote the cost price of the product for the wholesale seller as x.

Since the wholesale seller makes a 20% profit, the selling price for the wholesale seller will be x + 20% of x = x + 0.2x = 1.2x.

This selling price becomes the cost price for the retail seller. The retail seller also makes a 20% profit, so the selling price for the retail seller will be 1.2x + 20% of 1.2x = 1.2x + 0.24x = 1.44x.

Given that the retail selling price is 576 rupees, we can equate this to 1.44x and solve for x:

1.44x = 576

Divide both sides by 1.44:

x = 576 / 1.44

x = 400

Therefore, the wholesale seller's cost price is 400 rupees.

Translation: The product of two positive perfect square numbers is 1576, and the ratio of the larger number to the smaller number is 9/7. What is the smaller number?

Now, let's denote the two perfect square numbers as x^2 and y^2, where x^2 is the smaller number and y^2 is the larger number. According to the problem:

1. The product of the two numbers is 1576: x^2 * y^2 = 1576
2. The ratio of the larger number to the smaller number is 9/7: y^2 / x^2 = 9/7

From the second equation, we can express y^2 in terms of x^2: y^2 = (9/7)x^2.

Substituting this expression for y^2 into the first equation, we get:
x^2 * (9/7)x^2 = 1576
(9/7)(x^4) = 1576

Multiplying both sides by 7/9 to solve for x^4:
x^4 = 1576 * (7/9)
x^4 = 1228
x^2 = sqrt(1228)

Since 1228 is not a perfect square, we need to find the factors of 1576 that are perfect squares and fit the ratio 9/7.

Let's factor 1576 into its prime factors to see if we can find perfect square factors:
1576 = 2^4 * 7^2

Now, looking at the factors, we can try to find two perfect square numbers whose product is 1576 and whose ratio is 9/7.

We notice that 4^2 * 7^2 = 16 * 49 = 784, and 2^2 * 7^2 = 4 * 49 = 196, but these don't fit our ratio or product. However, considering our ratio and the need for perfect squares, let's directly apply the ratio to find the squares:

Given y^2 / x^2 = 9/7, and knowing that both x^2 and y^2 must be factors of 1576, let's look for a combination that fits. We have 1576 = 2^4 * 7^2. To fit the ratio 9/7"

- Common factor 2 appears with the lowest power of 2^1 (since 2 is common but with varying powers across the numbers, we take the smallest power it appears with, which is 2^1 from 342).
- Common factor 3 appears with the lowest power of 3^1 (since 3 is common but with varying powers, we take the smallest power it appears with, which is 3^1 from 228 and 456).
- Common factor 19 appears with the power of 19^1 (since 19 appears in all numbers with the same power).

Thus, the GCD = 2^1 * 3^1 * 19^1 = 2 * 3 * 19 = 114.

""The length of a pond is 32 meters, the width is 20 meters, and the depth of the water in the pond is 3 meters. A machine is being used to drain the pond, which can pump out 0.1 cubic meters of water per second. How long will it take to drain the pond?""

2. Calculate the volume of water in the pond:
The volume of water in the pond can be calculated using the formula: Volume = Length * Width * Depth.
Volume = 32 meters * 20 meters * 3 meters = 1920 cubic meters.

3. Calculate the time it takes to drain the pond:
The machine pumps out 0.1 cubic meters of water per second. To find the time it takes to drain the pond, we need to divide the total volume of water by the rate at which the machine pumps out water.
Time (in seconds) = Total Volume / Rate = 1920 cubic meters / 0.1 cubic meters/second = 19200 seconds.

4. Convert the time from seconds to minutes:
Time (in minutes) = Time (in seconds) / 60 = 19200 seconds / 60 = 320 minutes.

""A orange seller buys 5 dozen oranges at 60 taka per dozen and sells them at 50 taka per dozen. How much loss does he incur?""

Now, let's solve the problem:

The seller buys 5 dozen oranges at 60 taka per dozen, so the total cost price is:
5 dozen * 60 taka/dozen = 5 * 60 = 300 taka

Since 1 dozen = 12, the seller buys a total of 5 * 12 = 60 oranges.

Now, he sells the oranges at 50 taka per dozen. So, the total selling price is:
5 dozen * 50 taka/dozen = 5 * 50 = 250 taka

To find the loss, we subtract the selling price from the cost price:
Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price
= 300 taka - 250 taka
= 50 taka

Therefore, the seller incurs a loss of 50 taka.

""Mr. Ramiz deposited 5000 taka in the bank and decided that he would not withdraw money from the bank for the next 6 years. If the bank's annual profit is 10%, then after 6 years, he will get _____ taka as profit.""

Now, let's solve the problem. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (initial investment).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is 5000 taka, the annual interest rate (r) is 10% or 0.10 as a decimal, the interest is compounded annually (n = 1), and the time (t) is 6 years, we can calculate the amount after 6 years.

A = 5000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*6)
A = 5000(1 + 0.10)^6
A = 5000(1.10)^6
A = 5000 * 1.771561
A = 8857.805

The profit is the amount after 6 years minus the principal amount.
Profit = A - P
Profit = 8857.805 - 5000
Profit = 3857.805

Rounding to the nearest whole number, since we're dealing with money and the question seems to imply a whole number answer:
Profit ≈ 3858

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""Gita, Rita, and Mita together have 180 rupees. Gita has 6 rupees less than Rita and 12 rupees more than Mita. How many rupees does Gita have?""

Now, let's denote the amount of money Gita has as G, Rita has as R, and Mita has as M.

From the problem, we know:
1. G + R + M = 180
2. G = R - 6
3. G = M + 12

We can rewrite equation (3) as M = G - 12 and substitute it into equation (1):
G + R + (G - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:
2G + R - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:
2G + R = 192

Now, substitute equation (2) into the above equation:
2G + (G + 6) = 192

Combine like terms:
3G + 6 = 192

Subtract 6 from both sides:
3G = 186

Divide by 3:
G = 62

So, Gita has 62 rupees.

1. **Translation of the problem into English:**
The price of rice was 1080 Tk per quintal before the harvest. The price of rice increased by 15% during the monsoon. If a farmer sold 12 quintals of rice before the harvest, how much more money would he have received if he had sold the same amount of rice during the monsoon?

2. **Solution:**
- The initial price of rice per quintal is 1080 Tk.
- The price increase during the monsoon is 15% of 1080 Tk = 0.15 * 1080 = 162 Tk.
- Therefore, the price per quintal during the monsoon = 1080 + 162 = 1242 Tk.
- The farmer sold 12 quintals of rice.
- Before the harvest, he would have received 12 * 1080 = 12960 Tk.
- During the monsoon, he would have received 12 * 1242 = 14904 Tk.
- The difference in the amount received = 14904 - 12960 = 1944 Tk.

1. The students were arranged in rows of 12, 15, and 20 at different times. 
2. They were also arranged in a perfect square formation.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, and 20 gives us the smallest number of students that can be arranged into these different row configurations without any leftovers. 

- The prime factorizations are:
  - 12 = 2^2 * 3
  - 15 = 3 * 5
  - 20 = 2^2 * 5

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^2.
- The highest power of 3 is 3^1.
- The highest power of 5 is 5^1.

So, LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60.

This means that the minimum number of students that can be arranged into rows of 12, 15, and 20 is 60. However, since they were also arranged in a perfect square, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60.

The smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60 can be found by first finding the LCM and then checking the squares of multiples of the LCM until we find a perfect square.

Since 60 itself is not a perfect square, we look for the smallest square number that is a multiple of 60. 

60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, so to make it a perfect square, we need each prime factor to appear an even number of times. Thus, we multiply 60 by the smallest set of primes that makes each prime's exponent even:
- For 2, which is already 2^2, we don't need more.
- For 3, we need another 3 to make 3^2.
- For 5, we need another 5 to make 5^2.

Thus, the smallest number that makes 60 into a perfect square is 60 * 3 * 5 = 900. 

And indeed, 900 is a perfect square (30^2).

The problem states that a person has 5000 rupees and divides it between two people such that the first person gets four times the amount of the second person. Later, when the first person gives 1500 rupees to the second person, both have an equal amount of money. We need to find the initial amount of money the second person had.

## Step 2: Assign variables to represent the amounts of money the first and second persons initially have.
Let's denote the initial amount of money the first person has as ""x"" rupees and the initial amount of money the second person has as ""y"" rupees.

## Step 3: Formulate the relationship between the amounts of money the first and second persons have based on the given condition.
According to the problem, the first person's amount is four times the second person's amount, so we can write the equation as x = 4y.

## Step 4: Express the total amount of money as an equation using the variables x and y.
Since the total amount of money is 5000 rupees, we have the equation x + y = 5000.

## Step 5: Substitute the expression for x from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4 to solve for y.
Substituting x = 4y into the equation x + y = 5000 gives us 4y + y = 5000, which simplifies to 5y = 5000. Solving for y, we get y = 5000 / 5 = 1000.

## Step 6: Verify the solution by checking the condition that occurs when the first person gives 1500 rupees to the second person.
After the first person gives 1500 rupees to the second person, the first person has x - 1500 rupees and the second person has y + 1500 rupees. According to the problem, these amounts are equal, so we can write the equation x - 1500 = y + 1500.

## Step 7: Substitute the known values of x and y into the equation from Step 6 to confirm the equality.
We already know that x = 4y and y = 1000, so x = 4 * 1000 = 4000. Substituting these values into the equation x - 1500 = y + 1500 gives us 4000 - "

""Find a two-digit number such that when 7 is added to the sum of its digits, the result is three times the digit in the tens place. However, when 18 is subtracted from the number, the digits swap places.""

Let's denote the tens digit as ""T"" and the units digit as ""U"". The two-digit number can be represented as 10T + U.

From the given condition, the sum of the digits plus 7 equals three times the tens digit:
T + U + 7 = 3T

Rearranging the equation gives:
U + 7 = 2T
U = 2T - 7

Now, let's consider the second condition. When 18 is subtracted from the number, the digits swap places:
10T + U - 18 = 10U + T

Substitute U from the previous equation:
10T + (2T - 7) - 18 = 10(2T - 7) + T

Simplify the equation:
10T + 2T - 7 - 18 = 20T - 70 + T
12T - 25 = 21T - 70

Rearrange the equation to solve for T:
70 - 25 = 21T - 12T
45 = 9T
T = 5

Now, substitute T back into the equation U = 2T - 7:
U = 2(5) - 7
U = 10 - 7
U = 3

So, the original number is 10T + U = 10*5 + 3 = 53.

To verify, let's check if subtracting 18 from 53 indeed swaps the digits:
53 - 18 = 35

Thus, the digits do swap places as required.

t = 2520 / (4500 * 0.08)
t = 2520 / 360
t = 7

Therefore, the number of years after which the total interest will be 2520 taka is 7.

Translation: There are two smallest consecutive perfect squares whose difference is also a perfect square. The smaller number will be _____.

Now, let's solve the problem. We are looking for two consecutive numbers, let's denote them as n and n+1, such that their squares (n^2 and (n+1)^2) have a difference that is also a perfect square.

The difference between the squares of two consecutive numbers can be expressed as:
(n+1)^2 - n^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2 = 2n + 1.

We need this difference (2n + 1) to be a perfect square. Since 2n + 1 is odd, we look for odd perfect squares because only they can be expressed as 2n + 1.

The smallest odd perfect square is 1 (1^2), but if we try to find n for 2n + 1 = 1, we get n = 0, which doesn't fit our context of positive consecutive integers.

The next smallest odd perfect square is 9 (3^2). So, we set 2n + 1 = 9, which gives us:
2n = 8
n = 4

This means the smaller number is 4, and the larger number is 5, because their squares (16 and 25) have a difference (9) that is a perfect square.

Therefore, the smaller number will be 4.

""The annual profit is reduced from 10% to 8%. If so, the profit of 3000 rupees for 3 years will be _____ less.""

Next, we calculate the difference in profit over 3 years due to the reduction in the annual profit percentage from 10% to 8%.

Initially, at 10% annual profit, the total profit over 3 years on 3000 rupees is calculated as follows:
- First year: 3000 * 10% = 300 rupees
- Second year: (3000 + 300) * 10% = 330 rupees
- Third year: (3000 + 300 + 330) * 10% = 363 rupees
Total profit at 10% = 300 + 330 + 363 = 993 rupees

However, for simplicity and accuracy in comparison, we calculate the total amount after 3 years at both rates to find the actual profit difference:

At 10% annual interest, the formula to calculate the amount after 3 years is:
A = P(1 + r)^n, where P = principal amount, r = annual interest rate, n = number of years.
A = 3000(1 + 0.10)^3
A = 3000(1.10)^3
A = 3000 * 1.331 = 3993

At 8% annual interest:
A = 3000(1 + 0.08)^3
A = 3000(1.08)^3
A = 3000 * 1.2597 = 3779.1

The difference in amount (which reflects the difference in profit) after 3 years = 3993 - 3779.1 = 213.9 rupees.

475,একটি দ্রব্য ১৯০ টাকায় ক্রয় করে ১৭৫ টাকায় বিক্রয় করলে শতকরা _____  ভাগ লাভ বা ক্ষতি হবে ।,৭.৮৯,"To solve this problem, we first need to translate it into English for clarity:

""A commodity is bought for 190 taka and sold for 175 taka. What percentage of profit or loss will it incur?""

Now, let's calculate the percentage of loss since the selling price is less than the buying price.

Loss = Buying price - Selling price
Loss = 190 - 175
Loss = 15

To find the percentage of loss:
Percentage of loss = (Loss / Buying price) * 100
Percentage of loss = (15 / 190) * 100
Percentage of loss = 0.0789 * 100
Percentage of loss = 7.89%

Since the problem involves a loss (as the item is sold for less than it was bought), we express the answer as a loss percentage.

""The length of a rectangular land is three times its width, and the perimeter of the land is 40 meters. The width of the land is _____ meters.""

Now, let's denote the width of the land as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is three times the width, so we can write:
L = 3W

The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
P = 2L + 2W

We are told the perimeter is 40 meters, so:
40 = 2L + 2W

Substituting L = 3W into the equation:
40 = 2(3W) + 2W
40 = 6W + 2W
40 = 8W

Dividing both sides by 8 to solve for W:
W = 40 / 8
W = 5

So, the width of the land is 5 meters.

""The diameter of a right circular cone is 4 cm and the height is 9 cm. The curved surface area of the cone is _____ square cm. (π = 3.14)""

Now, let's solve the problem. The formula for the curved surface area of a cone is given by:

Curved Surface Area = π * r * l

where r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height of the cone.

First, we need to find the radius (r) of the cone:
Diameter = 4 cm
Radius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 cm

Next, we need to find the slant height (l) of the cone:
We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height:
l = √(r² + h²)
where h is the height of the cone.

Given height (h) = 9 cm
Slant height (l) = √(2² + 9²) = √(4 + 81) = √85

Now, we can calculate the curved surface area:
Curved Surface Area = π * r * l
= 3.14 * 2 * √85
≈ 3.14 * 2 * 9.22
≈ 3.14 * 18.44
≈ 57.93

Therefore, the curved surface area of the cone is approximately 57.93 square cm.

The question is about the number of leap years that have occurred from the time India gained independence until the year 2024.

1. **Translation of the Problem**: The problem states, ""After India gained independence, until the year 2024, a total of _____ years have been leap years.""

2. **Understanding Leap Years**: A leap year occurs every 4 years, according to the Gregorian calendar, to keep our calendar aligned with the Earth's orbit around the Sun. 

3. **India's Independence Year**: India gained independence in 1947.

4. **Calculating Leap Years**:
    - The first leap year after 1947 would be 1948.
    - To find the total number of leap years from 1947 to 2024, we calculate the number of leap years in this period.

5. **Calculation**:
    - From 1948 to 2024, we can calculate the number of leap years by first finding the total number of years and then dividing by 4, considering that every 4th year is a leap year.
    - The year 2024 is a leap year.
    - Total years from 1948 to 2024 = 2024 - 1948 + 1 = 77 years.
    - Since every 4th year is a leap year, we divide the total number of years by 4 and round down to the nearest whole number because partial years do not count as full leap years.
    - 77 years / 4 years per leap year = 19.25, which means there are 19 full leap year cycles.

6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, from India's independence until 2024, there have been 19 leap years.

""An amount of principal yields a profit of 5500 in 3 years. If the profit is 3/8 of the principal, then the principal amount is _____.""

Let's denote the principal amount as P. According to the problem, the profit is 3/8 of the principal. So, we can write:

Profit = (3/8) * P

Given that the profit is 5500, we can set up the equation:

(3/8) * P = 5500

To find the principal amount P, we need to solve for P. We can multiply both sides by 8/3 to isolate P:

P = 5500 * (8/3)

P = 14666.67

First, translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The ratio of copper, silver, and gold is 3:5. The ratio of copper to silver in the jewelry is 1:2, and the ratio of silver to gold is 3:5. In a 19-gram jewelry, how many grams of gold are there?""

Let's denote the amount of copper, silver, and gold as C, S, and G respectively.

Given:
1. C:S:G = 3:5
2. C:S = 1:2
3. S:G = 3:5

From (2), we can write C = S/2.

From (3), we can write S = 3G/5.

Substituting the value of S from (3) into the equation from (2), we get:
C = (3G/5)/2 = 3G/10.

Now, we substitute C and S in terms of G into the first ratio:
3G/10 : 3G/5 : G = 3:5

To make the ratios simpler, multiply each term by 10 to clear the denominators:
3G : 6G : 10G = 3:6:10

This shows the ratio of copper, silver, and gold in the simplest form is 3:6:10.

Given the total weight of the jewelry is 19 grams, we can set up the equation based on the parts of the ratio:
3x + 6x + 10x = 19

Combine like terms:
19x = 19

Divide by 19:
x = 1

So, the amount of gold (G) is 10x = 10*1 = 10 grams.

""The length of a rectangular land is three times its width, and the perimeter of the land is 40 meters. The length of the land is _____ meters.""

Now, let's solve the problem. 

Given that the length of the rectangular land is three times its width, we can denote the width as W and the length as 3W.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + width). We are told the perimeter (P) is 40 meters. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

40 = 2(3W + W)

Simplifying the equation:

40 = 2(4W)

40 = 8W

Now, divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:

W = 40 / 8

W = 5

Since the length is three times the width (3W), we substitute W with 5:

Length = 3 * 5

Length = 15

Therefore, the length of the land is 15 meters.

Let's denote the number of apples Faiaz had as F and the number of apples Ayaz had as A.

From the first condition, we know that if Faiaz gave 10 apples to Ayaz, then Ayaz would have A + 10 apples and Faiaz would have F - 10 apples. According to the problem, A + 10 = 3(F - 10).

Simplifying this equation gives us:
A + 10 = 3F - 30
A = 3F - 40

From the second condition, we know that if Ayaz gave 20 apples to Faiaz, then Faiaz would have F + 20 apples and Ayaz would have A - 20 apples. According to the problem, F + 20 = 2(A - 20).

Simplifying this equation gives us:
F + 20 = 2A - 40
F = 2A - 60

Now we substitute F from the second equation into the first equation:
A = 3(2A - 60) - 40
A = 6A - 180 - 40
A = 6A - 220
-5A = -220
A = 44

So, Ayaz had 44 apples.

""The total cost to cover the floor of a room with carpet is Tk 7200. If the width of the room were 3 meters less, the cost would have been Tk 576 less. What is the width of the room in meters?""

Let's denote the width of the room as W and the length as L. The cost of covering the floor with carpet is directly proportional to the area of the room, which is given by the formula: Area = Width * Length.

Given that the total cost is Tk 7200, we can set up a proportionality relationship between the cost and the area. Let's assume the cost per unit area is C. Then, the total cost is given by:

7200 = C * W * L ... (Equation 1)

If the width of the room were 3 meters less, the new width would be (W - 3), and the new cost would be Tk 576 less, i.e., Tk 7200 - 576 = Tk 6624. This can be represented as:

6624 = C * (W - 3) * L ... (Equation 2)

We can simplify Equation 2 by expanding the right-hand side:

6624 = C * W * L - 3 * C * L

Now, substitute the expression for C * W * L from Equation 1:

6624 = 7200 - 3 * C * L

Subtract 7200 from both sides:

-576 = -3 * C * L

Divide both sides by -3:

192 = C * L

Now, substitute this expression into Equation 1:

7200 = 192 * W

Divide both sides by 192:

W = 7200 / 192
W = 37.5

So, the width of the room is 37.5 - 3 = 34.5 - 3 + 3 = 37.5 - 3 + 3, but since the width can't be a decimal for practical purposes and the question is incomplete regarding the correct formula, the provided data implies the solution should have been approached with the actual formula and known variables for an accurate calculation.

""The circumference of the front wheel of an engine is 1.4 meters, and the circumference of the rear wheel is two and a half times the circumference of the front wheel. Calculate the minimum distance in meters at which both wheels will complete an integer number of revolutions at the same time.""

Now, let's break it down:

1. The circumference of the front wheel is 1.4 meters.
2. The circumference of the rear wheel is 2.5 times the circumference of the front wheel, which is 2.5 * 1.4 = 3.5 meters.

To find the minimum distance at which both wheels complete an integer number of revolutions, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the circumferences of the two wheels.

The LCM of 1.4 and 3.5 can be calculated by first converting these numbers to integers by multiplying them by 10 (since they have one decimal place), which gives us 14 and 35. 

Then, we find the LCM of 14 and 35, which is 70. 

Since we multiplied the original numbers by 10, we need to divide the LCM by 10 to get the actual minimum distance, which is 70 / 10 = 7 meters.

Therefore, the minimum distance at which both wheels will complete an integer number of revolutions at the same time is 7 meters.

A 3-meter long, 2-meter wide, and 1-meter high empty tank contains a solid metal cube with a side length of 50 cm. After the tank is filled with water and the cube is removed, the water depth will be ____ meters.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we calculate the volume of the tank:
Volume of tank = length * width * height = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 cubic meters.

2. Then, we calculate the volume of the cube:
Side length of cube = 50 cm = 0.5 meters (converting cm to meters).
Volume of cube = side^3 = 0.5^3 = 0.125 cubic meters.

3. After the tank is filled with water and the cube is removed, the volume of water in the tank will be the volume of the tank minus the volume of the cube:
Volume of water = Volume of tank - Volume of cube = 6 - 0.125 = 5.875 cubic meters.

4. Since the tank's dimensions are given as length = 3 meters, width = 2 meters, we can calculate the new water depth after the cube is removed:
Let's denote the new water depth as 'h'.
The formula for the volume of water is: Volume = length * width * height.
So, 5.875 = 3 * 2 * h.
Solving for 'h': h = 5.875 / (3 * 2) = 5.875 / 6 = 0.9792 meters.
