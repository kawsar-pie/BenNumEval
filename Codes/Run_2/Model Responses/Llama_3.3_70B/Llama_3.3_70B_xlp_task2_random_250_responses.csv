""A set has 3 elements, what is the number of its proper subsets?""

A proper subset is a subset that is not equal to the set itself. For a set with 'n' elements, the number of proper subsets can be calculated using the formula 2^n - 1, where the subtraction of 1 excludes the set itself.

Given that the set has 3 elements (n = 3), we can calculate the number of proper subsets as follows:
2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7

Therefore, the number of proper subsets of a set with 3 elements is 7.

The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

H2 + Cl2 -> 2HCl

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of hydrogen gas reacts with 1 mole of chlorine gas to produce 2 moles of hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Given:
- Mass of hydrogen gas = 5 grams
- Number of chlorine atoms = 1.27 x 10^24

First, let's find the number of moles of hydrogen gas. The molar mass of hydrogen gas (H2) is approximately 2 grams/mole.

Moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molar mass of H2 = 5 g / 2 g/mole = 2.5 moles

Since the reaction between H2 and Cl2 is in a 1:1 ratio, the number of moles of Cl2 required to react with 2.5 moles of H2 is also 2.5 moles.

Now, we need to find out how many moles of chlorine atoms are in 1.27 x 10^24 atoms. Since 1 mole of any substance contains 6.022 x 10^23 particles (Avogadro's number), the number of moles of chlorine atoms is:

Moles of Cl atoms = total Cl atoms / Avogadro's number
= 1.27 x 10^24 / 6.022 x 10^23
= 2.11 moles of Cl atoms

However, for the reaction, we need the number of moles of Cl2 (chlorine gas), not chlorine atoms. Since each molecule of Cl2 contains 2 chlorine atoms, the number of moles of Cl2 is half the number of moles of Cl atoms:

Moles of Cl2 = moles of Cl atoms / 2
= 2.11 moles / 2
= 1.055 moles of Cl2

The molar mass of Cl2 is approximately 70.9 grams/mole. Now, we calculate the mass of Cl2:

Mass of Cl2 = moles of Cl2 * molar mass of Cl2
= 1.055 moles * 70.9 g/mole
≈ 74.73 grams

Translation: ""Tickets numbered from 1 to 10 are well mixed, and one ticket is randomly picked. What is the probability that the ticket number is a multiple of 2 or 3?""

Now, let's solve the problem. 

The total number of tickets is 10. 

Multiples of 2 from 1 to 10 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. That's 5 numbers.
Multiples of 3 from 1 to 10 are: 3, 6, 9. That's 3 numbers.
However, 6 is a multiple of both 2 and 3, so we've counted it twice. 

So, the total number of unique tickets that are multiples of 2 or 3 is 5 (multiples of 2) + 3 (multiples of 3) - 1 (the duplicate count of 6) = 7.

The probability of picking a ticket that is a multiple of 2 or 3 is therefore the number of favorable outcomes (7) divided by the total number of outcomes (10).

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 7/10.

Therefore, the probability that the ticket number is a multiple of 2 or 3 is 7/10.

**Translation:** When two coins are tossed together, what is the probability of getting at least one head?

Now, let's analyze the possible outcomes when two coins are tossed. Each coin can result in either heads (H) or tails (T), leading to the following combinations for two coins:
1. HH (Both heads)
2. HT (First coin heads, second coin tails)
3. TH (First coin tails, second coin heads)
4. TT (Both tails)

Out of these four possible outcomes, three outcomes (HH, HT, TH) result in at least one head. Only one outcome (TT) results in no heads.

Given that each outcome is equally likely, we calculate the probability of getting at least one head as the number of favorable outcomes (at least one head) divided by the total number of outcomes.

The number of favorable outcomes (at least one head) = 3 (HH, HT, TH)
The total number of outcomes = 4 (HH, HT, TH, TT)

First, we translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states that 17.75 grams of sodium sulfate is dissolved in a 450 ml solution. We need to find the density of the solution.""

The density of a solution is calculated by dividing the mass of the solution by its volume. Since the mass of the solute (sodium sulfate) is given, we need to find the mass of the solvent (water) to calculate the total mass of the solution.

The density of water is approximately 1 gram per milliliter (g/ml). Therefore, the mass of the solvent (water) is:
Mass of water = Volume of water × Density of water
Given that the volume of the solution is 450 ml, we assume this is the total volume, so we can find the mass of water by multiplying this volume by the density of water, approximately 1 g/ml.

Mass of water = 450 ml × 1 g/ml = 450 grams

Now, we calculate the total mass of the solution:
Total mass of solution = Mass of solute + Mass of solvent
Total mass of solution = 17.75 grams + 450 grams = 467.75 grams

The volume of the solution is given as 450 ml. To find the density, we convert this volume to liters for consistency with standard units, but since 1 ml = 1 cm³, and density is often expressed in g/ml or g/cm³, we can directly use the volume in ml for calculation.

Density = Total mass of solution / Volume of solution
Density = 467.75 grams / 450 ml

Density ≈ 1.039 g/ml

Therefore, the density of the solution is approximately 1.039 grams per milliliter.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a cow is tied with a rope in such a way that it can graze an area of 144 square meters in a circular field. We need to find the diameter of this circular field.

2. **Solution:**
The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(A\) is the area and \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

Given \(A = 144\) square meters, we can solve for \(r\):
\[144 = \pi r^2\]

Using the value of \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), we can solve for \(r\):
\[r^2 = \frac{144}{\pi}\]
\[r^2 \approx \frac{144}{3.14159}\]
\[r^2 \approx 45.86\]
\[r \approx \sqrt{45.86}\]
\[r \approx 6.77 \, \text{meters}\]

1. Translate the problem: The problem states that a wheel covers a distance of 3.25 kilometers by revolving 25 times. We need to find the diameter of the wheel in meters.

2. Convert the distance to meters: Since 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters, the total distance covered is 3.25 km * 1000 m/km = 3250 meters.

3. Understand the relationship: The distance covered by the wheel in one revolution is equal to the circumference of the wheel. The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle (or, in this case, the wheel) is C = π * d, where d is the diameter of the circle, and π is approximately 3.14159.

4. Calculate the circumference: Since the wheel revolves 25 times to cover 3250 meters, the distance covered in one revolution (which is the circumference of the wheel) is 3250 meters / 25 = 130 meters.

5. Solve for the diameter: We know that the circumference C = 130 meters. Using the formula C = π * d, we can solve for d: d = C / π = 130 / 3.14159 ≈ 41.36 meters.

However, considering the context of the calculation and typical expectations for such problems, it seems there might have been an oversight in the precise calculation or interpretation of the given data, as the direct calculation does not immediately suggest a simple, whole-number answer typically expected in basic geometry problems.

Correcting the approach based on standard problem-solving expectations and reevaluating the given numbers and their direct implications on the formula might lead to a more straightforward calculation, emphasizing the fundamental principles of geometry and the properties of circles. Thus, ensuring the calculation aligns with educational standards and avoids unnecessary complexity is key.

Upon reflection, given the straightforward nature of these problems, the error likely lies in overcomplicating the calculation or a miscalculation in the simplification process, suggesting a review of basic geometric formulas and their application to real-world problems like this one.

528,তুঁতের এক অণুতে যুক্ত পানির ভর কত?,৯০,Chemistry,Chemistry,"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the components involved. The problem asks for the mass of water contained in a single molecule of cotton (which can be translated to ""cotton"" from Bengali, but it seems there might be a slight confusion in terms as ""তুঁত"" typically refers to cotton in Bengali).

Cotton is primarily composed of cellulose, a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of β(1→4) linked D-glucose units. The molecular formula for glucose (and thus the building block of cellulose) is C₆H₁₂O₆.

However, to calculate the mass of water in a molecule of cotton (cellulose), we need to clarify that the question might be referring to the water content in a cotton fiber or the molecular weight of water (H₂O) itself if we're considering hydration or the like. Since cotton as a material does contain some moisture, but the question seems to ask about the molecular level, let's consider the confusion and aim for a basic interpretation.

The molecular weight of water (H₂O) is approximately 18 g/mol (since Hydrogen, H, is about 1 g/mol and Oxygen, O, is about 16 g/mol). If we interpret the question as asking about the mass of a water molecule attached to or part of a cotton molecule (which might not be the most accurate representation but working with the given translation):

Given that a glucose unit (the component of cellulose) has the formula C₆H₁₂O₆, and if we're oddly considering the mass of water somehow integrated into this formula (which isn't directly applicable since water isn't a component of the glucose molecule itself but is essential for its hydration state), the question seems to be misleading or based on a misunderstanding.

If we were to directly address ""তুঁতের এক অণু"" as ""a molecule of cotton"" and consider an attached water molecule (H₂O) for some reason, the mass would be the molecular weight of water, which is approximately 18 g/mol. However, this seems to be an incorrect path due to the misinterpretation of cotton's composition and its relation to water at the molecular level.

Now, let's break down the problem:

The boy's mass is 40 kg, and he climbs 20 steps, each with a height of 16 cm. First, we need to calculate the total height the boy climbed:

Total height = Number of steps * Height of each step
Total height = 20 * 16 cm = 320 cm = 3.2 m (since 100 cm = 1 m)

The work done (W) by the boy can be calculated using the formula:

W = Force * Distance

Since the force here is due to gravity, we use the boy's weight as the force. The weight (F) of the boy is given by:

F = mass * acceleration due to gravity
F = 40 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 392 N

Now, we calculate the work done:

W = F * distance
W = 392 N * 3.2 m = 1254.4 J

Therefore, the boy did 1254.4 Joules of work.

When an object is tied to a string and rotated in a vertical plane (assuming it's like a pendulum), the work done (if any) would be related to the change in potential energy or kinetic energy. However, for a single rotation without specifying any change in height or speed, and assuming the only force involved is gravity and the tension in the string, the work done by the force of gravity can be considered if we think about changing the object's position from one point to another in a circular path.

But, without any additional context like a change in height or a specified mass and radius, we're actually looking at a basic physics concept that might not directly translate to work done due to gravity in the traditional sense (force applied over a distance). Given the simple context, it seems we might be considering the work done in rotating an object on a string in a vertical plane.

However, if we think about the minimum interpretation that could apply here - considering no height change and a single rotation - the ""work"" might be interpreted in terms of the energy expended to rotate the object against gravity's force if it's being lifted, or against friction if the string is not ideal. Yet, without explicit values (mass of the object, radius of rotation, gravitational acceleration), we're lacking key pieces of information to calculate work done in the traditional sense (Work = Force * Distance, or for rotational motion, Work = Torque * Angle).

The most straightforward interpretation of ""একটি বস্তুকে সুতায় বেধে উল্লম্বতলে একবার ঘুরিয়ে আনলে"" in a physics context without more specifics would suggest we're discussing a scenario where an object is rotated once in a vertical plane on a string.

The chemical reaction for the dehydration of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate to anhydrous copper(II) sulfate can be represented as:
CuSO4·5H2O → CuSO4 + 5H2O

The molar mass of CuSO4·5H2O is approximately 249.68 g/mol, and the molar mass of CuSO4 is approximately 159.61 g/mol.

Given:
- Initial mass of blue vitriol (CuSO4·5H2O) = 249.5 grams
- Mass of white powder (CuSO4) produced = 150 grams

To calculate the percentage yield, we first need to find the theoretical yield of CuSO4 from 249.5 grams of CuSO4·5H2O.

1. Calculate the number of moles of CuSO4·5H2O:

   Moles of CuSO4·5H2O = 249.5 g / 249.68 g/mol ≈ 1 mol

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of F2 reacts with 1 mole of H2 to form 2 moles of HF.

Given:
- Mass of fluorine (F2) = 50 grams
- Mass of hydrogen (H2) = 4 grams

First, we need to find the limiting reagent, which is the reactant that will be completely consumed in the reaction, thus limiting the amount of product formed.

Molar mass of F2 = 19 grams/mole (since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, F2, and the atomic mass of fluorine is approximately 19 grams/mole)
Molar mass of H2 = 2 grams/mole (since hydrogen is also a diatomic molecule, H2, and the atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1 gram/mole)

Number of moles of F2 = mass of F2 / molar mass of F2 = 50 grams / 19 grams/mole ≈ 2.63 moles
Number of moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molar mass of H2 = 4 grams / 2 grams/mole = 2 moles

Since the reaction requires 1 mole of F2 for every 1 mole of H2, and there are approximately 2.63 moles of F2 and 2 moles of H2, H2 is the limiting reagent because it has fewer moles than F2.

Thus, all 2 moles of H2 will react.

The question asks for the amount of hydrogen that will react with fluorine. Since we have determined that all of the hydrogen (2 moles) will react because it is the limiting reagent, the mass of hydrogen that reacts is the same as the mass given, which is 4 grams.

Therefore, the amount of hydrogen that will react with fluorine is 4 grams.

Molarity (M) = moles of solute / liters of solution
0.2 M = moles of Na2CO3 / 2 liters

The final error is 8 square meters. If the measured value is 120 square meters, what is the percentage relative error in determining the area?

2. **Solution:**
- **Actual Area:** Not directly given, but since we have a final error, we can assume the correct area is the measured area plus or minus the error. However, for calculating relative error, we consider the error relative to the measured value, not the absolute correctness of the measurement.
- **Measured Area:** 120 square meters
- **Error:** 8 square meters

The formula for the relative error is: \( \text{Relative Error} = \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{\text{Measured Value}} \)

Given the absolute error (final error) is 8 square meters and the measured value is 120 square meters, we can plug these values into the formula:

\( \text{Relative Error} = \frac{8}{120} \)

To find the percentage relative error, we then multiply by 100:

\( \text{Percentage Relative Error} = \left( \frac{8}{120} \right) \times 100 \)

\( \text{Percentage Relative Error} = \left( \frac{1}{15} \right) \times 100 \)

2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

From the equation, we see that 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide (MgO).

The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.31 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O2) is approximately 32 g/mol.

Given that we have 12 grams of magnesium, we first convert this to moles:

moles of Mg = mass of Mg / molar mass of Mg
moles of Mg = 12 g / 24.31 g/mol ≈ 0.493 mol

According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O2. Therefore, the moles of O2 required to react with 0.493 mol of Mg are:

moles of O2 = moles of Mg / 2
moles of O2 = 0.493 mol / 2 ≈ 0.2465 mol

Now, we convert the moles of O2 to grams:

mass of O2 = moles of O2 * molar mass of O2
mass of O2 ≈ 0.2465 mol * 32 g/mol ≈ 7.888 g

Therefore, 12 grams of magnesium will react with approximately 7.888 grams of oxygen.

1. **Translation of the problem:** A mountain at a distance of 450 kilometers creates an angle of 7 degrees. What is the height of the mountain in meters?

2. **Solution:**
   - The distance to the mountain is given as 450 kilometers. First, we need to convert this distance into meters because the height of the mountain is required in meters. Since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters, the distance in meters is 450,000 meters.
   - The angle created by the mountain is 7 degrees.
   - We can use the tangent function to find the height of the mountain. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this context, the tangent of the angle (7 degrees) is equal to the height of the mountain (opposite side) divided by the distance to the mountain (adjacent side).
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows: tan(7 degrees) = height / 450,000 meters.
   - To find the height, we rearrange the equation: height = 450,000 meters * tan(7 degrees).
   - Using a calculator to find the value of tan(7 degrees), we get approximately 0.1228.
   - Thus, the height of the mountain is approximately 450,000 meters * 0.1228 = 55,260 meters.

The formula is given by:

g_h = g * (R^2 / (R + h)^2)

where:
- g_h is the acceleration due to gravity at height h,
- g is the acceleration due to gravity on the Earth's surface (approximately 9.81 m/s^2),
- R is the radius of the Earth, and
- h is the height above the Earth's surface.

Given:
- R = 6.37 x 10^6 meters (radius of the Earth),
- h = 500 km = 5 x 10^5 meters (height above the Earth's surface),
- Mass of the Earth (M) = 5.98 x 10^24 kg, but we don't need this directly for the formula above since g is given.

First, calculate g using the formula g = G * M / R^2, where G is the gravitational constant (6.674 * 10^-11 N m^2 kg^-2). However, since we know g (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), we can directly proceed to calculate g_h.

Given g = 9.81 m/s^2,
R = 6.37 x 10^6 meters,
h = 5 x 10^5 meters,

Calculate g_h:
g_h = 9.81 * (6.37 x 10^6)^2 / (6.37 x 10^6 + 5 x 10^5)^2

First, calculate the denominators and numerators separately:
(6.37 x 10^6)^2 = 40.58 x 10^12
(6.37 x 10^6 + 5 x 10^5)^2 = (6.37 x 10^6 + 0.5 x 10^6)^2 = (6.87 x 10^6)^2 = 47.15 x 10^12

Then, calculate g_h:
g_h = 9.81 * (40.58 x 10^12) / (47.15 x 10^12)

g_h = 9.81 * 0.861

1. Translation of the problem: The problem states that there is a circle with a radius of 10 cm. We need to find the measure of the central angle of a 35 cm long arc.

2. Solution: The formula to find the arc length (L) given the radius (r) and the central angle (θ) in radians is L = r * θ. Since the central angle is required in degrees, we will eventually convert θ from radians to degrees using the conversion factor: 1 radian = (180/π) degrees.

Given: 
- Radius (r) = 10 cm
- Arc length (L) = 35 cm

Using the formula L = r * θ, we can solve for θ in radians:
θ = L / r = 35 cm / 10 cm = 3.5 radians

To convert θ from radians to degrees:
θ in degrees = 3.5 radians * (180/π) degrees/radian

Calculating θ in degrees:
θ = 3.5 * (180/π)
θ ≈ 3.5 * 57.29577951308232
θ ≈ 200.6352137962866 degrees

However, since a circle is 360 degrees and the calculation of the central angle should be within this range, the calculated value seems incorrect as it exceeds 360 degrees, which is not possible for a central angle of a circle. The error arises from incorrect calculation or misunderstanding of the conversion process.

Correct Approach:
The correct formula relating arc length (L), radius (r), and central angle (θ) in radians is indeed L = r * θ. To find θ, we use θ = L / r. Once θ is found in radians, convert it to degrees by multiplying by (180/π).

Let's correct the steps with the proper calculation:
θ in radians = L / r = 35 cm / 10 cm = 3.5 radians

Convert θ to degrees correctly:
θ in degrees = 3.5 * (180/π)

""An 800 gram bullet is shot from a gun at a speed of 400 m/s. If the mass of the gun is 3/2 kg, what is the recoil speed in m/s?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Given:
- Mass of the bullet (m) = 10 grams = 0.01 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 grams)
- Speed of the bullet (v) = 400 m/s
- Mass of the gun (M) = 3/2 kg = 1.5 kg

We can apply the law of conservation of momentum to solve this problem. The total momentum before the bullet is shot is zero, since neither the bullet nor the gun is moving. After the bullet is shot, the total momentum is the sum of the momentum of the bullet and the momentum of the gun. Since the total momentum must be conserved, we can set up the following equation:

0 = mv - MV

where V is the recoil speed of the gun.

Rearranging the equation to solve for V, we get:

V = mv / M
= (0.01 kg * 400 m/s) / (1.5 kg)
= 4/3 m/s
= 1.33 m/s * (3/3) 
= 2.67 m/s * (2/2)
But It is given 10 gram so it is 0.01 and gun mass is 3/2 = 1.5 so 
= (0.01 * 400) / 1.5
= 400 / 150

Therefore, the recoil speed of the gun is approximately 2.67 m/s.

The reaction between fluorine (F2) and hydrogen (H2) produces hydrogen fluoride (HF):

F2 + H2 → 2HF

From the given problem, we have 50 grams of fluorine and 4 grams of hydrogen.

1. First, let's determine the limiting reactant. To do this, we need the molar masses of fluorine (F2) and hydrogen (H2). The molar mass of F2 is approximately 38 g/mol (since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, 19 g/mol * 2), and the molar mass of H2 is approximately 2 g/mol (since hydrogen is also a diatomic molecule, 1 g/mol * 2).

2. Calculate the number of moles of F2 and H2:
   - Moles of F2 = mass of F2 / molar mass of F2 = 50 g / 38 g/mol ≈ 1.3158 mol
   - Moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molar mass of H2 = 4 g / 2 g/mol = 2 mol

3. From the balanced equation, 1 mole of F2 reacts with 1 mole of H2 to produce 2 moles of HF. Since we have more moles of H2 than F2, F2 is the limiting reactant.

4. Now, calculate the moles of H2 that react with F2:
   - Since 1 mole of F2 reacts with 1 mole of H2, and we have 1.3158 mol of F2, 1.3158 mol of H2 will react.

The problem states that a coin is flipped 720 times, and out of these flips, heads come up 480 times. We are asked to find the relative frequency of getting heads.

The problem states that an object weighing 5 kg is dropped from the roof of a 50-meter-high building. We need to find the kinetic energy of the object at the moment it touches the ground.

2. **Understanding the Physics:**
As the object falls, its potential energy (due to its height) is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy (PE) of an object is given by the formula PE = m * g * h, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height from which the object is dropped.

The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where v is the velocity of the object. However, since we are not directly given the velocity, we'll use the conservation of energy principle to find the kinetic energy at the moment the object touches the ground. According to this principle, the initial potential energy equals the final kinetic energy (assuming no energy is lost to friction or other forces).

3. **Calculating Initial Potential Energy:**
Given that m = 5 kg, g = 9.8 m/s^2, and h = 50 m, we can calculate the initial potential energy:
PE = m * g * h = 5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 50 m = 2450 J.

4. **Conservation of Energy:**
Since the initial potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (ignoring air resistance), at the moment the object hits the ground, all its energy will be in the form of kinetic energy. Thus, the kinetic energy at that moment equals the initial potential energy.

Therefore, the kinetic energy of the object at the moment it touches the ground will be 2450 J.

Since the reaction requires a 1:1 mole ratio of H2 to Cl2, and we have 0.5 moles of H2, we need 0.5 moles of Cl2 for the reaction to proceed completely with respect to H2.

Moles of Cl2 needed = 0.5 moles
Mass of Cl2 needed = moles of Cl2 needed * molecular weight of Cl2 = 0.5 moles * 71 g/mole = 35.5 grams

Now, to find out how much chlorine is left after the reaction:

Initial mass of Cl2 = 70 grams
Mass of Cl2 used = 35.5 grams
Mass of Cl2 left = Initial mass of Cl2 - Mass of Cl2 used = 70 grams - 35.5 grams = 34.5 grams

Therefore, after the reaction, 34.5 grams of chlorine will be left.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a rectangular solid has a length of 8 cm, a diagonal (or space diagonal, but here it seems to refer to the diagonal of the base or a face diagonal) of 9 cm, and a height of 4 cm. We are asked to find the width of this solid.

2. **Solution:**
Given:
- Length (l) = 8 cm
- Diagonal (d) = 9 cm
- Height (h) = 4 cm

We aim to find the width (w).

For a rectangular solid, the diagonal (space diagonal) can be found using the formula:
\[ d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \]

However, in this context, since we're given a diagonal of 9 cm and the dimensions of the solid, we need to clarify that the given diagonal is likely a face diagonal rather than the space diagonal, because if it were the space diagonal, the calculation would directly involve all three dimensions (length, width, and height).

If the given diagonal refers to a face diagonal, then for the face that includes length and width, the formula simplifies to:
\[ d^2 = l^2 + w^2 \]

Plugging the values into this equation:
\[ 9^2 = 8^2 + w^2 \]
\[ 81 = 64 + w^2 \]
\[ w^2 = 81 - 64 \]
\[ w^2 = 17 \]
\[ w = \sqrt{17} \]

Thus, the width of the rectangular solid is the square root of 17.

Translation: Russell said he had 452 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 9 (in hexadecimal) to Karim. How many bananas will Russell have left in the hexadecimal number system?

Now, let's convert the given hexadecimal numbers into decimal to perform the subtraction and then convert back to hexadecimal for the final answer.

Russell initially had 452 in hexadecimal. To convert 452 from hexadecimal to decimal:
- 4 * (16^2) = 4 * 256 = 1024
- 5 * (16^1) = 5 * 16 = 80
- 2 * (16^0) = 2 * 1 = 2
So, 452 in hexadecimal is 1024 + 80 + 2 = 1106 in decimal.

He gave 9 in hexadecimal to Karim. To convert 9 from hexadecimal to decimal:
- 9 * (16^0) = 9 * 1 = 9
So, 9 in hexadecimal is 9 in decimal.

Now, subtract the number of bananas given away from the initial number:
1106 (decimal) - 9 (decimal) = 1097 (decimal)

Finally, convert 1097 from decimal back to hexadecimal:
- 1097 / 16 = 68 remainder 9
- 68 / 16 = 4 remainder 4
- 4 / 16 = 0 remainder 4

So, 1097 in decimal is 449 in hexadecimal.

Therefore, Russell will have 449 bananas left in the hexadecimal number system.

The reaction between hydrogen (H₂) and chlorine (Cl₂) produces hydrochloric acid (HCl). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl

From the equation, we can see that 1 mole of hydrogen reacts with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2 moles of hydrochloric acid.

Given:
- Mass of hydrogen (H₂) = 1 gram
- Mass of chlorine (Cl₂) = 85 grams

First, we need to convert the given masses into moles to understand the stoichiometry of the reaction.

Molecular weight of H₂ = 2 grams/mole
Molecular weight of Cl₂ = 70.9 grams/mole (approximately)

Moles of H₂ = mass of H₂ / molecular weight of H₂ = 1 / 2 = 0.5 moles
Moles of Cl₂ = mass of Cl₂ / molecular weight of Cl₂ = 85 / 70.9 ≈ 1.2 moles

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of H₂ reacts with 1 mole of Cl₂. Since we have 0.5 moles of H₂, it will react with 0.5 moles of Cl₂.

Moles of Cl₂ that reacted = 0.5 moles
Moles of Cl₂ left = total moles of Cl₂ - moles of Cl₂ that reacted = 1.2 - 0.5 = 0.7 moles

To find the mass of Cl₂ left, we multiply the moles of Cl₂ left by its molecular weight:

Mass of Cl₂ left = moles of Cl₂ left * molecular weight of Cl₂ = 0.7 * 70.9 ≈ 49.63 grams

Therefore, the amount of chlorine left after the reaction is approximately 49.63 grams.

""Two objects of mass 15 kg and 10 kg are moving towards each other on the same road with speeds of 3 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively. After a head-on collision, they stick together. What is the combined velocity in m/s?""

Now, let's apply the principle of conservation of momentum to solve this problem. The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

Momentum of the 15 kg object before collision = 15 kg * 3 m/s = 45 kg*m/s
Momentum of the 10 kg object before collision = 10 kg * (-5 m/s) = -50 kg*m/s (negative sign indicates opposite direction)

Total momentum before collision = 45 kg*m/s - 50 kg*m/s = -5 kg*m/s

After the collision, the two objects stick together, so their combined mass is 15 kg + 10 kg = 25 kg. Let's denote their combined velocity as v.

Total momentum after collision = (15 kg + 10 kg) * v = 25 kg * v

According to the principle of conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision:

-5 kg*m/s = 25 kg * v

Now, solve for v:

v = -5 kg*m/s / 25 kg
v = -0.2 m/s

Since the question asks for the magnitude of the velocity, we take the absolute value:

v = 0.2 m/s

Therefore, the combined velocity of the two objects after the collision is 0.2 m/s.

The smallest division of the main scale is 0.5mm, and 19 divisions of the main scale are equal to 20 divisions of the vernier scale. What is the vernier constant in mm?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Main scale reading = 5mm
- Vernier scale reading = 16 divisions
- Smallest division of main scale = 0.5mm
- 19 divisions of main scale = 20 divisions of vernier scale

First, we find the least count (vernier constant) of the vernier scale. 
The least count of the vernier scale = (Smallest division of main scale) / (Number of divisions of vernier scale - Number of divisions of main scale)
= (0.5mm) / (20 - 19)
= (0.5mm) / 1
= 0.5mm, but this is not the vernier constant. 

To find the vernier constant, we first calculate the difference in length measured by the main scale and the vernier scale.
Since 19 divisions of the main scale = 20 divisions of the vernier scale, 
19 * 0.5mm = 20 * vernier constant
9.5mm = 20 * vernier constant
Vernier constant = 9.5mm / 20
= 0.475mm

Therefore, the vernier constant is 0.475mm.

This principle states that the pressure applied to a fluid in a closed system is transmitted equally in all directions. In the context of a hydraulic press, the pressure applied to the smaller piston is transmitted to the larger piston, resulting in a force that is proportional to the ratio of the areas of the two pistons.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that the areas of the smaller and larger pistons in a hydraulic press are 5 square centimeters and 25 square centimeters, respectively. When a force of 100 Newtons is applied to the smaller piston, we need to find out how much force will be exerted on the larger piston.

2. **Solution:**
Given:
- Area of the smaller piston (A1) = 5 square cm
- Area of the larger piston (A2) = 25 square cm
- Force applied to the smaller piston (F1) = 100 Newtons
- Force exerted on the larger piston (F2) = ?

According to Pascal's principle, the pressure (P) is the same in both pistons, which means:
\[ P = \frac{F1}{A1} = \frac{F2}{A2} \]

We can rearrange this equation to solve for F2:
\[ F2 = F1 \times \frac{A2}{A1} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ F2 = 100 \times \frac{25}{5} \]
\[ F2 = 100 \times 5 \]

Now, let's solve the problem:

Given:
- Mass (m) = 10 kg
- Force (F) = 200 N
- Time (t) = 20 seconds

We know that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), i.e., F = ma.

Rearranging the formula to find acceleration (a), we get:
a = F / m

Since the object is initially stationary, the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s.

We can use the formula: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.

Substituting the given values:
v = 0 + (20 m/s^2) * (20 s)

The problem states that the diameter of the Earth is 12,800 km. Dhaka and Chittagong form an angle of 4 degrees at the center of the Earth. We need to find the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong.

2. **Solution:**
The Earth is approximately spherical, and the diameter given is 12,800 km. This means the radius of the Earth is half of the diameter, which is 12,800 / 2 = 6,400 km.

Given that Dhaka and Chittagong form an angle of 4 degrees at the center of the Earth, we can use the formula for the arc length of a circle (which represents the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong along the Earth's surface) to find this distance. The formula for arc length (L) is given by L = θ × r, where θ is the central angle in radians, and r is the radius of the circle.

First, convert the angle from degrees to radians: θ = 4 degrees * (π / 180) = 4 * π / 180 radians.

Then, calculate the arc length using the radius of the Earth (6,400 km) and the angle in radians: L = (4 * π / 180) * 6,400.

Perform the calculation: L = (4 * π / 180) * 6,400 ≈ (4 * 3.14159 / 180) * 6,400 ≈ 0.069813 * 6,400 ≈ 446.816 km.

However, the calculated distance is along the great circle (the shortest path on the surface of a sphere), which is not exactly the same as the distance along the surface roads or direct flight paths due to the Earth's slightly ellipsoidal shape and other factors. But for the purpose of this problem, considering the Earth as a perfect sphere, the distance between Dhaka and Chittagong is approximately the calculated arc length.

Since the coefficient of expansion is given in Kelvin, and the temperature change is given in Celsius, we note that the change in temperature in Kelvin is the same as the change in Celsius because the zero points are different but the scale intervals are the same.

Given:
- α = 34.8 x 10^-6 / Kelvin
- L = 100 meters = 10000 centimeters (since we need the final answer in centimeters)
- ΔT = 35 Kelvin (or Celsius, as the change is the same)

Now, plug the values into the formula:

ΔL = α * L * ΔT
= (34.8 x 10^-6 / Kelvin) * 10000 cm * 35 Kelvin
= 34.8 * 10^-6 * 10000 * 35
= 12.18 cm

Therefore, the length of the rail increases by 12.18 centimeters due to the temperature change.

The momentum (p) of an object is given by the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v): p = mv. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula: KE = 0.5mv^2.

1. **Translation of the Problem**: The problem asks at what velocity of an object its momentum and kinetic energy will be equal.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**: To find when the momentum equals the kinetic energy, we set the two equations equal to each other: mv = 0.5mv^2.

3. **Solving for Velocity**: We can simplify this equation to find v. First, we can divide both sides by m (since m cannot be 0 for an object with mass) to get v = 0.5v^2. Then, we can divide both sides by v (assuming v is not 0, because if v = 0, the object has no momentum or kinetic energy) to solve for v: 1 = 0.5v. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us v = 2.

Therefore, the velocity at which the momentum and kinetic energy of an object are equal is 2 units (in whatever unit system is being used, typically meters per second).

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. We need to find the radius of the resulting cylinder.

2. **Solution:**
The volume of the sphere is given by \( \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Given that the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can calculate its volume as:
\[ V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

The volume of the cylinder is given by \( \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder's base, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the height (\( h \)) of the cylinder is 32 cm. Thus, the volume of the cylinder can be expressed as:
\[ V_{cylinder} = \pi r^2 (32) = 32\pi r^2 \]

Since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, their volumes are equal. Therefore, we can equate the two volume expressions:
\[ 288\pi = 32\pi r^2 \]

Solving for \( r \):
\[ 288 = 32r^2 \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{288}{32} = 9 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{9} = 3 \, \text{cm} \]

The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O

From the equation, we can see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2 to produce 1 mole of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and 1 mole of water (H2O).

Given:
- Mass of NaOH = 10 grams
- Mass of CO2 = 5 grams

First, we need to convert these masses into moles to understand the stoichiometry of the reaction.

Molar mass of NaOH = 40 g/mol
Molar mass of CO2 = 44 g/mol

Moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol
Moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2 = 5 g / 44 g/mol ≈ 0.114 mol

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of CO2 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. Therefore, the moles of NaOH required to react with 0.114 mol of CO2 would be:

Moles of NaOH required = 2 * moles of CO2 = 2 * 0.114 mol ≈ 0.228 mol

Since we have 0.25 mol of NaOH available, which is more than the 0.228 mol required for the reaction, CO2 is the limiting reactant, and all of the CO2 will react. The amount of NaOH that will react is 0.228 mol, as calculated.

To find out how much NaOH is left, we subtract the moles of NaOH that reacted from the total moles of NaOH we started with:

Moles of NaOH left = Total moles of NaOH - Moles of NaOH that reacted
= 0.25 mol - 0.228 mol
= 0.022 mol

Finally, to convert the moles of NaOH left into grams, we multiply by the molar mass of NaOH:

""The combined reading of the main scale and vernier scale is 12.66 cm. If the vernier constant is 6, what is the vernier constant in mm? (The main scale reading is 12.6 cm.)""

Now, let's solve the problem:

The main scale reading is 12.6 cm, and the combined reading is 12.66 cm. This means the vernier scale reading is 0.06 cm. 

Since the vernier constant is the least count of the vernier scale, we can calculate it as follows:

Least count of vernier scale = 1 main scale division / number of vernier scale divisions
= 1 mm / 10 (assuming 10 vernier scale divisions for 9 main scale divisions, which is a common configuration)
= 0.1 mm (or 1/10 of a main scale division)

However, the problem states that the vernier constant is 6, which seems to imply that 1 main scale division is divided into 6 parts on the vernier scale (instead of the more common 10). 

In this case, 1 main scale division (1 mm) is divided into 6 parts, so each part is:
1 mm / 6 = 0.1667 mm (approximately)

Given that the vernier scale reading is 0.06 cm, which is equivalent to 6 mm * (0.06 cm / 1 cm), we can find the actual vernier constant. However, this interpretation does not align perfectly with standard vernier scale functionality.

Following the more conventional interpretation where the vernier constant (least count) is directly provided or implied by the device's configuration:
If 0.06 cm on the vernier scale corresponds to a vernier constant, and considering 1 cm = 10 mm, 0.06 cm = 0.6 mm. Given 6 divisions on the vernier for this 0.6 mm reading, the vernier constant is indeed related to the least count, which should directly relate to the division of the main scale division by the number of vernier divisions. 

But since the question directly asks for the vernier constant in mm and implies a specific numerical value for it (related to the ""6"" mentioned), and considering the given information might be misunderstood or misinterpreted without clear context on the vernier scale's division, let's directly approach what's asked"

Atomic weights (approximate): H = 1, Cl = 35.5, O = 16

Molecular weight of HClO4 = 1 (H) + 35.5 (Cl) + 4*16 (O) = 1 + 35.5 + 64 = 100.5 g/mol

- Main scale reading = 4 cm
- Vernier scale coincidence = 7
- Vernier constant = 0.1 mm

The vernier constant is the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division. Given that 1 cm = 10 mm, we need to convert the vernier constant into centimeters for consistency. 

0.1 mm = 0.01 cm (since 1 mm = 0.1 cm)

The given problem in English translates to:
""A circle has a diameter of 20 cm. What is the measure of the central angle of a 50 cm long arc of the circle?""

Given:
- Diameter of the circle = 20 cm
- Length of the arc = 50 cm

First, we find the radius of the circle:
Radius = Diameter / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 cm

Next, we calculate the circumference of the entire circle using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius:
Circumference = 2 * π * 10 = 20π ≈ 62.83 cm

The length of the arc (50 cm) is a fraction of the circumference. To find the central angle, we use the proportion of the arc length to the circumference, which equals the proportion of the central angle to 360 degrees (the total angle around a point).

Let θ (theta) be the central angle in degrees:
(50 / 62.83) = (θ / 360)

Solving for θ:
θ = (50 / 62.83) * 360
θ ≈ 0.796 * 360
θ ≈ 286.56 degrees

Since an arc cannot have a central angle greater than 360 degrees, and given that the calculated angle exceeds 180 degrees (which would be the case for a larger arc that does not complete a full circle), it suggests a misunderstanding in the direct calculation of the angle based on the given data. The approach to calculating the central angle should directly relate to the proportion of the arc length to the circumference, considering the entire circumference corresponds to a 360-degree rotation.

Correcting the approach:
The formula to find the central angle (θ) in radians, given the arc length (s) and radius (r), is θ = s / r. To convert radians to degrees, we multiply by (180 / π).

Given s = 50 cm and r = 10 cm:
θ in radians = 50 / 10 = 5 radians

To convert radians to degrees:

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a mountain, located 150 kilometers away, subtends an angle of 2.50 radians. We need to find the height of the mountain.

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
The angle given is in radians, and we know the distance from the point of observation to the mountain. The height of the mountain can be found using the tangent function, which relates the angle, the height of the mountain (opposite side), and the distance from the observer to the mountain (adjacent side).

3. **Applying Trigonometry:**
The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side (height of the mountain, h) to the length of the adjacent side (distance from the observer to the mountain, d). Therefore, tan(angle) = h / d.

Given:
- Angle = 2.50 radians
- Distance (d) = 150 kilometers

We need to find the height (h) of the mountain.

4. **Calculation:**
The formula can be rearranged to solve for h: h = d * tan(angle).

Substituting the given values:
h = 150 km * tan(2.50 radians)

Using a calculator to find the tangent of 2.50 radians:
tan(2.50 radians) ≈ -0.747 (Note: The tangent function can give negative values for angles greater than π/2 radians, but since we're interested in the magnitude of the height, we'll use the absolute value.)

h ≈ 150 km * |-0.747|
h ≈ 150 km * 0.747
h ≈ 112.05 km

However, considering the context and typical application of such calculations, it seems there might have been an oversight in directly applying the trigonometric function without converting the understanding into a form that directly addresses the problem's specific geometry, particularly since the direct application of tangent with the given values doesn't immediately align with the expected outcome for calculating heights based on angular measurements and distances in typical geometric or trigonometric problems.

For an angle and a distance to define a height directly (in the context of viewing an object or a mountain from a distance), the relationship often involves considering the angle's effect in a manner that aligns with right triangle trigonometry. The"

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states, ""What is the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas under standard conditions?""

2. **Standard Conditions:**
Standard conditions for gases are defined as 0°C (273.15 K) temperature and 1 atm (101.325 kPa) pressure.

3. **Molecular Weight of Hydrogen:**
The molecular weight of hydrogen (H2) is approximately 2 grams per mole.

4. **Ideal Gas Law:**
The ideal gas law is given by PV = nRT, where:
- P is the pressure in pascals (Pa),
- V is the volume in cubic meters (m³),
- n is the number of moles of gas,
- R is the gas constant (approximately 8.3145 J/mol·K),
- T is the temperature in kelvins (K).

5. **Calculating the Volume:**
Given that we have 2 grams of hydrogen, which is equivalent to 1 mole (since the molecular weight of H2 is 2 g/mol), we can calculate the volume under standard conditions.

Rearranging the ideal gas law to solve for V gives us V = nRT / P.

Substituting the given values:
- n = 1 mole (since 2 grams of H2 is 1 mole),
- R = 8.3145 J/mol·K,
- T = 273.15 K (standard temperature),
- P = 101325 Pa (standard pressure).

V = (1 mol) * (8.3145 J/mol·K) * (273.15 K) / (101325 Pa)

V ≈ 0.0224 m³ or 22.4 liters.

Therefore, under standard conditions, 2 grams (or 1 mole) of hydrogen gas occupies approximately 22.4 liters.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a 0.2 molar solution of potassium carbonate is prepared in 500 milliliters (mL). We need to find out how many grams of potassium carbonate are in the solution.

2. **Understanding Molarity:**
Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The formula for molarity is M = moles of solute / liters of solution. Given that the solution is 0.2 molar, this means there are 0.2 moles of potassium carbonate per liter of solution.

3. **Calculating Moles of Potassium Carbonate in 500 mL:**
First, we convert 500 mL to liters since molarity is defined per liter. 500 mL = 0.5 liters.
Then, we calculate the moles of potassium carbonate in 0.5 liters of a 0.2 molar solution:
Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles

4. **Molar Mass of Potassium Carbonate (K2CO3):**
The molar mass of K2CO3 can be calculated by adding the atomic masses of its constituent atoms: potassium (K), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). The atomic masses are approximately: K = 39 g/mol, C = 12 g/mol, and O = 16 g/mol. So, the molar mass of K2CO3 = (2*39) + 12 + (3*16) = 78 + 12 + 48 = 138 g/mol.

5. **Calculating Grams of Potassium Carbonate:**
Now, we calculate the mass of 0.1 moles of potassium carbonate:
Mass = moles * molar mass = 0.1 moles * 138 g/mol = 13.8 grams

At 8:20 AM, the hour hand will be between the 8 and the 9, and the minute hand will be at the 4 (since 20 minutes have passed).

The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours or 30 degrees in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it moves 0.5 degrees per minute. At 8:20, the hour hand will have moved (8 * 30) + (20 * 0.5) = 240 + 10 = 250 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.

The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute. At 20 minutes past the hour, it will be at 20 * 6 = 120 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.

To find the angle between the two hands, we subtract the smaller angle from the larger one. However, we need to determine the smaller and larger angles first. 

Given the positions:
- Hour hand at 250 degrees
- Minute hand at 120 degrees

The angle between them can be found by subtracting the smaller position value from the larger:
250 - 120 = 130 degrees

Therefore, the angle included between the hour and minute hands at 8:20 AM is 130 degrees.

""An enclosed container holds 0.25 cubic meters of gas. The gas pressure is 27 x 10^3 pascals, and the temperature is 40 degrees Celsius. Determine the amount of gas present. (The gas constant is 8.314)""

Now, we can proceed with solving the problem using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Given:
- P = 27 x 10^3 pascals = 27000 pascals
- V = 0.25 cubic meters
- R = 8.314 J/(mol*K)
- T = 40 degrees Celsius + 273.15 = 313.15 Kelvin

We need to rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for n (number of moles):
n = PV / RT

Plugging in the values:
n = (27000 * 0.25) / (8.314 * 313.15)

First, calculate the numerator:
27000 * 0.25 = 6750

Then, calculate the denominator:
8.314 * 313.15 = 2601.4717

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:
n = 6750 / 2601.4717 ≈ 2.59 moles

The final step is to remember that the question asks for the ""amount of gas,"" which typically refers to the number of moles for gases, but in the context of a numerical answer, it's essential to understand if moles or mass is requested. Given the information and typical problems of this nature, the solution will assume the answer sought is in moles.

The probability of an event is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

1. **Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:**
   The problem asks for the probability of getting either heads or tails when a coin is flipped, given that getting heads or tails is a certain event.

2. **Analysis:**
   When a coin is flipped, there are two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Since the question specifies that getting heads or tails is a certain event, it implies that these are the only outcomes possible in this context. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes (when considering only heads or tails as valid outcomes) is 2.

   The favorable outcomes for the event ""getting heads or tails"" include both heads and tails, which means there are 2 favorable outcomes.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The formula for probability is: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.
   
   Given that both outcomes (heads or tails) are favorable in this context, and there are no other outcomes considered, the calculation is straightforward:
   
   Probability = 2 (favorable outcomes) / 2 (total possible outcomes) = 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The probability of getting heads or tails in a coin flip, when these are considered certain events and the only possible outcomes, is 1. This is because every time the coin is flipped, it will either land on heads or tails, making the occurrence of one of these events a certainty.

The ideal gas law is given by PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

3. **Applying the Ideal Gas Law:** At standard conditions (STP), P = 1 atm, T = 273.15 K, and for 5 moles of any ideal gas, we can calculate the volume using the ideal gas law. The gas constant R is approximately 0.0821 L atm/(mol K).

The balanced chemical equation for the formation of ammonia (NH3) from hydrogen and nitrogen is:

N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to form 2 moles of ammonia.

Given:
- Mass of hydrogen gas (H2) = 5 grams
- Mass of nitrogen gas (N2) = 30 grams

First, we convert the given masses into moles. The molar mass of H2 is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of N2 is approximately 28 grams/mole.

Moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molar mass of H2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 moles
Moles of N2 = mass of N2 / molar mass of N2 = 30 / 28 ≈ 1.0714 moles

From the balanced equation, 3 moles of H2 react with 1 mole of N2. Therefore, the moles of N2 that can react with 2.5 moles of H2 are:

Since 3 moles of H2 react with 1 mole of N2, 2.5 moles of H2 will react with (2.5 / 3) moles of N2.

Moles of N2 that react = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 moles

Now, to find the moles of N2 left:

Moles of N2 left = Total moles of N2 - Moles of N2 that react

First, let's translate the given Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states that 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved in a 500 ml solution, and we are asked to find the density of the solution.""

To calculate the density, we need the mass of the solution and its volume. The volume of the solution is given as 500 ml, which is equivalent to 0.5 liters or 500 cm³ (since 1 ml = 1 cm³). The mass of the sulfuric acid is given as 24.5 grams, but to find the density of the solution, we need the total mass of the solution, not just the solute.

However, since the density of a solution is typically calculated as the mass of the solution divided by its volume, and given that the mass of the sulfuric acid is provided, we would ideally need the mass of the solvent (water, in this case) to calculate the total mass of the solution. Without the explicit mass of the solvent or the total solution, we can't directly calculate the density of the solution as it's usually defined (mass of solution/volume of solution).

But, assuming the goal is to understand how the given information could lead to a calculation related to density or concentration, let's consider what we can do with the given data:

Given:
- Mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) = 24.5 grams
- Volume of the solution = 500 ml = 0.5 liters

The molar mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is approximately 98.08 g/mol.

Molarity = moles / volume (in liters) = 0.25 mol / 0.5 L = 0.5 M

Translation: If an object is dropped from the roof of a 50-meter tall building, at what speed will it hit the ground?

To find the speed at which the object hits the ground, we use the equation for free fall, which is derived from the equation of motion under constant acceleration (in this case, acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.81 m/s^2). The equation we need is:

v^2 = v0^2 + 2as

where:
- v is the final velocity (the velocity at which the object hits the ground),
- v0 is the initial velocity (which is 0, since the object is dropped from rest),
- a is the acceleration (which is g for free fall, approximately 9.81 m/s^2),
- s is the displacement (the height from which the object is dropped, 50 meters in this case).

Given that v0 = 0, the equation simplifies to:

v^2 = 2as
v^2 = 2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 50 m
v^2 = 981 m^2/s^2

From the given reaction, we see that 2 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2 moles of sodium chloride.

The molar mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 23 g/mol, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 71 g/mol (since atomic mass of Cl is about 35.5 g/mol).

Given:
- Mass of sodium (Na) = 40 g
- Mass of chlorine (Cl2) = 35.5 g

First, let's convert the given masses into moles to understand the stoichiometry of the reaction:

Moles of Na = Mass of Na / Molar mass of Na = 40 g / 23 g/mol ≈ 1.739 mol
Moles of Cl2 = Mass of Cl2 / Molar mass of Cl2 = 35.5 g / 71 g/mol ≈ 0.5 mol

From the reaction equation, 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 2 moles of Na. So, for 0.5 mol of Cl2, we would need 1 mol of Na to completely react (since 0.5 mol Cl2 * 2 mol Na / 1 mol Cl2 = 1 mol Na).

We have approximately 1.739 mol of Na available, which is more than the 1 mol needed to react with 0.5 mol of Cl2. Therefore, Cl2 is the limiting reagent, and Na is in excess.

The amount of Na that will react with 0.5 mol of Cl2 is 1 mol (as per the stoichiometry of the reaction). 

To find out how much sodium is left, we subtract the amount of sodium that reacted from the total amount of sodium:
Reacted Na = 1 mol * 23 g/mol = 23 g
Remaining Na = Total Na - Reacted Na = 40 g - 23 g = 17 g

Therefore, 17 grams of sodium will remain after the reaction.

1. The atomic mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 23 g/mol.
2. The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12 g/mol.
3. The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 g/mol.

The molar mass of Na2CO3 = (2 * 23) + 12 + (3 * 16)
= 46 + 12 + 48
= 106 g/mol

Now, to find the percentage composition of carbon in sodium carbonate:
Percentage of carbon = (mass of carbon in the compound / molar mass of the compound) * 100
= (12 / 106) * 100

Calculating the percentage:
= (12 / 106) * 100

Translation: In a right-angled triangle, the base is 12 and the height is 5, what is the hypotenuse?

Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), or a^2 + b^2 = c^2, we can find the length of the hypotenuse.

Here, the base (a) = 12 and the height (b) = 5. 

So, c^2 = 12^2 + 5^2
c^2 = 144 + 25
c^2 = 169
c = √169
c = 13

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 13.

- L₀ is the original length of the material,
- ΔT is the change in temperature.

Given:
- ΔT = 100°C (since the temperature is increased by 100°C),
- α for copper (the material in question) is approximately 16.5 × 10⁻⁶ /°C,
- The final length (L) after the expansion is 10.0167 meters.

We are asked to find the original length (L₀) of the copper rod.

The relationship between the original length (L₀), the final length (L), and the change in length (ΔL) is:
L = L₀ + ΔL

Substituting the formula for ΔL from the linear expansion equation:
L = L₀ + αL₀ΔT

Given that L = 10.0167 meters and ΔT = 100°C, we substitute α for copper:
10.0167 = L₀ + (16.5 × 10⁻⁶)(L₀)(100)

The problem states that Abir participates in a 1000-meter competition at an average speed of 100 m/s and needs to finish the competition 20 seconds earlier than his current pace to win.

2. **Calculating Current Time:**
First, let's calculate the time Abir takes to complete the 1000-meter race at his average speed of 100 m/s.
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1000 \, \text{m}}{100 \, \text{m/s}} = 10 \, \text{s} \]

3. **Calculating Required Time to Win:**
Abir needs to finish the race 20 seconds earlier than his current time to win. However, since his current time is 10 seconds, finishing 20 seconds earlier than this is not possible as it would result in a negative time, which is not feasible in the context of this problem.

4. **Analyzing the Situation:**
Given that Abir's current completion time is 10 seconds, and he aims to finish 20 seconds earlier than this (which would be -10 seconds), it's clear there's an issue with the framing of the problem as presented. If we interpret ""20 seconds earlier"" as a requirement to reduce his time by 20 seconds to a new total time, we would be looking at a completion time of 0 seconds or less, which is physically impossible.

First, translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""A 2 kg mass object falls from rest and covers 36 meters in 3 seconds. What is the force of fluid friction in the given scenario?""

Now, let's solve the problem.

The object is under the influence of gravity and possibly fluid friction (air resistance in this case). The acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2. 

Given:
- Mass (m) = 2 kg
- Distance (d) = 36 m
- Time (t) = 3 s

First, calculate the acceleration of the object:
We can use the equation of motion: d = vi*t + 0.5*a*t^2, where vi = 0 (initial velocity, since it's dropped from rest).

Rearranging for 'a' gives: a = 2*d / t^2

Substitute the given values: a = 2*36 / 3^2 = 72 / 9 = 8 m/s^2

The acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2, but the object's actual acceleration is less (8 m/s^2) due to the opposing force of fluid friction.

The net force acting on the object is its weight minus the force of fluid friction, which equals its mass times its acceleration (from Newton's second law of motion).

Weight (W) = m * g = 2 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 19.62 N

The force of fluid friction (F_f) can be found from:
m * a = m * g - F_f

Rearrange to solve for F_f: F_f = m * g - m * a

Substitute the known values: F_f = 2 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 - 2 kg * 8 m/s^2
F_f = 19.62 N - 16 N
F_f = 3.62 N

Total balls = Blue balls + White balls + Black balls
Total balls = 12 + 16 + 20

The probability of drawing a white ball is the number of white balls divided by the total number of balls:
Probability of white ball = Number of white balls / Total balls
Probability of white ball = 16 / 48
Probability of white ball = 1/3

Since we are looking for the probability of not drawing a white ball, we subtract the probability of drawing a white ball from 1 (because the sum of the probability of an event happening and the probability of it not happening is 1):
Probability of not white ball = 1 - Probability of white ball
Probability of not white ball = 1 - 1/3

   - The molarity of a solution is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. 
   - Given that the solution is 0.2 molar, this means there are 0.2 moles of calcium bicarbonate per liter of solution.
   - Since we have 2 liters of the solution, we can find the total number of moles of calcium bicarbonate by multiplying the molarity by the volume of the solution in liters.
   - Moles of calcium bicarbonate = Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.2 moles/liter * 2 liters = 0.4 moles.
   - The molar mass of calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2) can be calculated by adding the atomic masses of calcium (Ca), hydrogen (H), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). The formula for calcium bicarbonate is Ca(HCO3)2, which means it contains one calcium atom, two hydrogen atoms, two carbon atoms, and six oxygen atoms. The atomic masses are approximately: Ca = 40.08 g/mol, H = 1.008 g/mol, C = 12.01 g/mol, and O = 16.00 g/mol.
   - Molar mass of Ca(HCO3)2 = 40.08 + (2*1.008) + (2*12.01) + (6*16.00) = 40.08 + 2.016 + 24.02 + 96.00 = 162.116 g/mol.

2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

From the atomic masses, the atomic mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24 g/mol, and the atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 g/mol. Therefore, the molecular mass of magnesium oxide (MgO) is 24 (for Mg) + 16 (for O) = 40 g/mol.

Given that we start with 56 grams of magnesium, we first convert this mass into moles to understand how many moles of magnesium we have:

Moles of Mg = Mass of Mg / Atomic mass of Mg
Moles of Mg = 56 g / 24 g/mol = 2.33 mol

Since the reaction produces 2 moles of MgO from 2 moles of Mg, the number of moles of MgO produced will be equal to the number of moles of Mg reacted, given that there is sufficient oxygen for the reaction to go to completion.

Moles of MgO produced = Moles of Mg reacted = 2.33 mol

Typically, a circular scale (also known as a vernier scale) is used in conjunction with a linear scale to provide more precise measurements. The vernier scale allows for readings to a fraction of the smallest division on the linear scale. Given that the linear scale reads 4 mm and assuming the circular (vernier) scale's 0.17 mm reading is meant to refine this measurement, we can add these two values together.

Therefore, the diameter of the wire would be the sum of the linear and circular scale readings: 4 mm + 0.17 mm = 4.17 mm.

Translation: A wheel with a diameter of 0.20 meters rotates once. How many meters of distance will it cover?

Now, let's solve the problem. When a wheel rotates once, the distance it covers is equal to its circumference. The formula for the circumference of a circle (or, in this case, the wheel) is C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter of the circle.

Given the diameter (d) is 0.20 meters, we can calculate the circumference as follows:

C = πd = 3.14159 * 0.20

C ≈ 3.14159 * 0.20
C ≈ 0.628318

Therefore, the distance the wheel will cover in one rotation is approximately 0.628318 meters.

""An car travels at a speed of 36 km/h and after 1 minute, its speed becomes 72 km/h. What distance does the car cover during this time?""

Now, we can proceed to solve the problem. First, let's convert the time into hours since the speeds are given in kilometers per hour (km/h). 1 minute is 1/60 of an hour.

The car's initial speed is 36 km/h, and its final speed is 72 km/h. We are looking for the distance covered during the 1-minute interval when the speed changes.

To find the distance, we need to calculate the average speed of the car during this 1-minute interval. However, since the acceleration is uniform (assuming it accelerates uniformly from 36 km/h to 72 km/h in 1 minute), we can use the formula for uniformly accelerated motion. But for simplicity and given the information, we'll consider the average speed approach for a basic estimation.

Average speed = (Initial speed + Final speed) / 2
Average speed = (36 km/h + 72 km/h) / 2 = 108 km/h / 2 = 54 km/h

Now, to find the distance covered in 1 minute (1/60 of an hour) at this average speed:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 54 km/h × (1/60) h

To find the distance in kilometers:
Distance = 54 × (1/60) = 0.9 km

Therefore, the car covers 0.9 kilometers in the given time frame.

Given:
- Mass of H2SO4 = 25 g
- Volume of the solution = 100 ml = 0.1 L (since 1 L = 1000 ml)

First, translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states that 25 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved in a 100 ml solution. We need to find the molarity of the solution.""

Now, calculate the number of moles of H2SO4:

The complementary angle of a given angle is the angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 90 degrees. However, in this context, it seems we are looking for the supplement of the given angle, as the problem mentions ""সম্পুরক কোণ"" which translates to ""supplement"" in the context of angles, not ""complement"". The supplement of an angle is the angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180 degrees.

1. **Translation of the problem:** The problem asks for the supplement of a 110-degree angle, expressed in a circular or possibly a radian measure, but given the context, it seems to be asking for the supplement in degrees.

2. **Solution:** To find the supplement of a 110-degree angle, we subtract the given angle from 180 degrees because the sum of an angle and its supplement is 180 degrees.
   
   Supplement = 180 degrees - Given angle
   Supplement = 180 degrees - 110 degrees
   Supplement = 70 degrees

Since the question might imply expressing this in a ""circular"" manner, it could be interpreted as asking for the radian measure. However, the direct supplement in degrees is the most straightforward interpretation.

To express 70 degrees in radians, we use the conversion factor where 180 degrees equals π radians:

   Radians = 70 * (π / 180)

Translation: A metallic solid sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 36 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Radius of the sphere (r) = 3 cm
- Height of the cylinder (h) = 36 cm

First, we need to find the radius of the cylinder. We know that the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder, as the sphere is melted to form the cylinder.

The volume of a sphere (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3
The volume of a cylinder (V) = π * R^2 * h, where R is the radius of the cylinder.

Equating the two volumes, we get:
(4/3) * π * r^3 = π * R^2 * h

Substituting the given values:
(4/3) * π * (3)^3 = π * R^2 * 36
(4/3) * π * 27 = π * R^2 * 36
36 * π = π * R^2 * 36
R^2 = 1
R = 1 cm (since radius cannot be negative)

Now, we can find the curved surface area of the cylinder using the formula:
Curved surface area = 2 * π * R * h
= 2 * π * 1 * 36
= 72 * π
≈ 72 * 3.14159
≈ 226.19468

Rounded to two decimal places, the curved surface area is approximately 226.19 square centimeters.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The molecular weight of 11 moles of carbonic acid is?""

2. Calculate the molecular weight of carbonic acid (H₂CO₃):

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""100 mL of solution contains 10.6 grams of soda ash, what is the density of the solution?""

The density of a solution can be calculated using the formula: density = mass / volume.

Given:
- Mass of soda ash = 10.6 grams
- Volume of the solution = 100 mL = 0.1 liters (since 1 liter = 1000 mL)

However, to find the density of the solution, we need to know the mass of the entire solution, not just the mass of the soda ash dissolved in it. Assuming the density of the solvent (water, in this case) is approximately 1 gram/mL, we can estimate the mass of the solvent and then calculate the total mass of the solution.

Mass of solvent (water) ≈ Volume of solution × Density of water
Mass of solvent ≈ 100 mL × 1 g/mL = 100 grams

Total mass of the solution = Mass of soda ash + Mass of solvent
Total mass of the solution = 10.6 grams + 100 grams = 110.6 grams

2. The main scale reading is 12 mm.
3. The vernier scale reading is 7, implying that the 7th division on the vernier scale coincides with a main scale division.

The least count of the vernier scale (or vernier constant) is the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division.

1. **Translation of the Problem**: Lincoln has a toy box with toys representing each number in the binary number system. Lincoln's siblings have 5 more boxes of toys.

Given the information, we can't directly calculate the total number of toys without knowing the range of binary numbers represented. However, if we assume the question implies that each box contains a complete set of binary numbers (from 0 to a certain value), we still lack specific details to compute the exact number of toys.

If we consider a basic interpretation where each box represents a unique set of binary digits (0 and 1), and assuming each sibling has a similar set plus 5 additional boxes, the problem still lacks clarity on what these additional boxes contain or represent in terms of binary numbers.

Since the binary system starts with 0 and 1, and without a specified upper limit, we can't accurately determine the total count of toys.

**Assumption for a Simplistic Interpretation**: If Lincoln has toys for each binary digit (0 and 1), that makes 2 toys. If each of his siblings has 5 more boxes, and assuming each box can minimally represent these two digits, that would imply more toys. However, without clear details on what these additional boxes contain (whether they expand the binary range or just replicate it), we can't calculate the total number of toys accurately.

1. Translation of the problem: 
A metal solid sphere with a diameter of 5 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. What is the height of the resulting cylinder in cm?

2. Solution:
The volume of a sphere (V) is given by the formula: V = (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
Given diameter of the sphere = 5 cm, radius (r) = 5/2 = 2.5 cm.
Volume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * (2.5)^3.

The volume of a cylinder (V) is given by the formula: V = π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
Given radius of the cylinder = 3 cm.

Since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, their volumes are equal.
(4/3) * π * (2.5)^3 = π * (3)^2 * h
(4/3) * (2.5)^3 = (3)^2 * h
(4/3) * 15.625 = 9 * h
62.5/3 = 9h
h = 62.5/27
h ≈ 2.315

However, considering significant figures and rounding, we should focus on precise calculation:
(4/3) * π * (2.5)^3 = π * (3)^2 * h
(4/3) * π * 15.625 = π * 9 * h
4 * 15.625 = 3 * 9 * h
62.5 = 27 * h
h = 62.5 / 27

Calculating precisely without intermediate rounding gives us the accurate answer.

""Translation: A metal solid sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, so its radius is 3 cm.
2. The volume of the sphere (V) can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.
   V = (4/3)π(3)³ = (4/3)π(27) = 36π cubic centimeters.
3. When the sphere is melted to form a cylinder, the volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere.
4. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder.
5. We know the volume of the cylinder (36π cubic centimeters) and its height (4 cm). We can use this information to find the radius of the base of the cylinder.
   36π = πr²(4)
   36 = 4r²
   9 = r²
   r = 3 cm (since the radius cannot be negative)
6. Now that we know the radius of the base of the cylinder is 3 cm and its height is 4 cm, we can calculate the total surface area of the cylinder.
   The total surface area of a cylinder (A) is given by the formula A = 2πr² + 2πrh.
   A = 2π(3)² + 2π(3)(4)
   A = 2π(9) + 2π(12)
   A = 18π + 24π
   A = 42π

""A person weighing 70 kg climbs a 100-meter high mountain in 5 minutes. What is his power in watts? The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the work done by the person in climbing the mountain. The work done (W) is given by the formula: W = m * g * h, where m is the mass of the person, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the mountain.

W = 70 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m = 68600 J

2. Next, we need to calculate the time taken by the person to climb the mountain in seconds, as the time given is in minutes. 

Time = 5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds

3. Now, we can calculate the power (P) of the person using the formula: P = W / t, where W is the work done and t is the time taken.

P = 68600 J / 300 s = 228.67 W

Therefore, the power of the person is approximately 228.67 watts.

Magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2) decomposes into magnesium oxide (MgO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and oxygen (O2) when heated. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

2Mg(NO3)2 → 2MgO + 4NO2 + O2

Given that 0.25 moles of Mg(NO3)2 are heated, we need to calculate the volume of NO2 produced at standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions, which are 0°C and 1 atm. 

From the equation, 2 moles of Mg(NO3)2 produce 4 moles of NO2. Therefore, 0.25 moles of Mg(NO3)2 will produce:

(0.25 mol Mg(NO3)2) * (4 mol NO2 / 2 mol Mg(NO3)2) = 0.5 mol NO2

At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. Thus, the volume of NO2 produced is:

2H2 + O2 → 2H2O

From the equation, we see that 2 moles of hydrogen gas react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of water.

The molecular weight of water (H2O) is approximately 18 grams per mole (since hydrogen (H) has a molecular weight of about 1 gram/mole and oxygen (O) has a molecular weight of about 16 grams/mole).

Given that 9 grams of water are produced, we can calculate the number of moles of water produced as follows:

Moles of water = Mass of water / Molecular weight of water
Moles of water = 9 g / 18 g/mole = 0.5 moles

Since 2 moles of water are produced from 1 mole of oxygen, the number of moles of! oxygen required to produce 0.5 moles of water is:

Moles of oxygen = Moles of water / 2
Moles of oxygen = 0.5 moles / 2 = 0.25 moles

The molecular weight of oxygen (O2) is approximately 32 grams per mole (since each mole of oxygen gas contains 2 atoms of oxygen, each with a molecular weight of about 16 grams/mole).

Therefore, the mass of oxygen required is:

Mass of oxygen = Moles of oxygen * Molecular weight of oxygen

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Convert the mass of the bullet to kilograms: 20 grams = 0.02 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 grams).

2. The initial velocity (v_i) of the bullet is 0 m/s (assuming it starts from rest), and the final velocity (v_f) is 500 m/s.

3. The time (t) over which the bullet is accelerated is 0.1 seconds.

4. We can find the acceleration (a) of the bullet using the equation v_f = v_i + at, where v_i = 0. So, 500 = 0 + a*0.1. Solving for a gives a = 500 / 0.1 = 5000 m/s^2.

5. Now, apply Newton's second law to find the force exerted on the bullet: F = ma = 0.02 kg * 5000 m/s^2.

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. The probability of Rafiq going from Khulna to Rajshahi by bus is 4/5.
2. The probability of Rafiq going from Rajshahi to Rangpur by train is 6/7.
3. To find the probability that Rafiq goes from Khulna to Rajshahi by bus but does not go from Rajshahi to Rangpur by train, we need to find the probability of the first event (going from Khulna to Rajshahi by bus) and subtract the probability of the second event (going from Rajshahi to Rangpur by train) given that the first event has occurred.

The probability of Rafiq not going from Rajshahi to Rangpur by train is 1 - 6/7 = 1/7.

Since these events are dependent (Rafiq needs to go to Rajshahi first before deciding whether to go to Rangpur), we multiply the probability of the first event (4/5) by the probability of not going to Rangpur given that he has gone to Rajshahi (1/7).

""A body of unit mass is thrown upwards with a velocity of 10 m/s. At what height from the ground will the kinetic energy and potential energy of the body be equal?""

Now, let's solve the problem:

The kinetic energy (KE) of the body is given by the equation: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. Since the mass is unity (1 kg), the kinetic energy is: KE = (1/2)v^2.

The potential energy (PE) of the body is given by the equation: PE = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height.

Since the body is thrown upwards, its velocity decreases as it gains height. Let's denote the velocity at the point where KE = PE as v'. The kinetic energy at this point is: KE = (1/2)v'^2.

Equating the kinetic energy and potential energy, we get: (1/2)v'^2 = gh.

Since the body is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 10 m/s, we can use the equation of motion: v'^2 = u^2 - 2gh, where u is the initial velocity (10 m/s). Substituting this into the previous equation, we get: (1/2)(u^2 - 2gh) = gh.

Simplifying the equation, we get: (1/2)(100 - 2gh) = gh, which further simplifies to: 100 - 2gh = 2gh, and then: 100 = 4gh.

Now, solving for h, we get: h = 100 / (4g) = 100 / (4 * 9.8) = 100 / 39.2 = 2.55 m.

Therefore, the height from the ground where the kinetic energy and potential energy of the body will be equal is approximately 2.55 meters.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
The problem states that the difference in the circumference of two wheels is 90 cm, and we need to find the difference in their radii.

2. Solve the problem:
The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.

Let's denote the radii of the two wheels as r1 and r2. The difference in their circumferences is given as 90 cm, so we can write:

2πr1 - 2πr2 = 90

Now, we can factor out 2π from both terms:

2π(r1 - r2) = 90

To find the difference in radii (r1 - r2), we can divide both sides by 2π:

r1 - r2 = 90 / (2π)

Now, we can calculate the value:

r1 - r2 = 90 / (2 * 3.14159)
= 90 / 6.28318
≈ 14.32

However, to provide a more precise answer, we can use the fact that 2π is approximately equal to 2 * 22/7, which is a common approximation for π:

2π ≈ 2 * 22/7
= 44/7

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

(44/7)(r1 - r2) = 90

Multiply both sides by 7/44 to solve for (r1 - r2):

r1 - r2 = 90 * (7/44)
= 630/44
= 14.31818 (approximately)

However, considering the original problem is likely seeking an exact answer based on an simplified assumption of pi, let's assume it uses the fraction 22/7 for pi, as commonly done in such problems for simplification:

2 * (22/7) * (r1 - r2) = 90

Solving for (r1 - r2) gives:

(44/7) * (r1 - r2) = 90

Multiply both sides by 7/44:

r1 - r2 = 90 * (7/44)

This simplifies to:

r1 - r2 = 630 / 44

Further simplification gives:

""Translation: How many grams of nitric acid are present in 250 cubic centimeters of 0.01 molar nitric acid solution?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. Given that the molarity of the nitric acid solution is 0.01 M, this means there are 0.01 moles of nitric acid per liter of solution.

2. The volume of the solution is given as 250 cubic centimeters (or milliliters, since 1 cm³ = 1 mL). To find the number of moles of nitric acid in 250 mL of solution, we first convert the volume to liters because molarity is defined in terms of liters. Since 1 liter = 1000 mL, 250 mL = 0.250 liters.

3. Now, we calculate the number of moles of nitric acid in 0.250 liters of 0.01 M solution:

The molar mass of nitric acid (HNO₃) can be calculated by summing the atomic masses of its constituent atoms: Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1 g/mol, Nitrogen (N) has an atomic mass of approximately 14 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 g/mol. Since there are three oxygen atoms in a molecule of nitric acid, the total molar mass is:
   Molar mass of HNO₃ = 1 (for H) + 14 (for N) + 3*16 (for 3 O) = 1 + 14 + 48 = 63 g/mol

5. To find the mass of nitric acid in 250 mL of 0.01 M solution, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass:
   Mass = Moles * Molar mass
   Mass = 0.0025 moles * 63 g/mol = 0.1575 grams

Therefore, the mass of nitric acid in 250 cubic centimeters of 0.01 molar nitric acid solution is 0.157"

Now, let's calculate the profit. The formula to calculate the amount after a certain period with compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

Since the problem doesn't specify the compounding frequency, we'll assume it's simple interest for simplicity. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where:
- I is the interest.
- P is the principal amount.
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given P = 10,000 rupees, r = 5% or 0.05 (decimal), and t = 10 years, we plug these values into the simple interest formula:

I = 10,000 * 0.05 * 10
I = 5,000

So, the profit made from 10,000 rupees in 10 years at a 5% interest rate is 5,000 rupees.

1. Translation of the problem: 
""A boy completed 8 rounds on a circular path with a radius of 5 meters. What is the distance traveled by the boy?""

2. Solution:
The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is given by C = 2 * π * radius (r), where π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

Given the radius (r) is 5 meters, we calculate the circumference as follows:
C = 2 * π * 5
C ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 5
C ≈ 31.4159 meters

Since the boy completed 8 rounds, the total distance (D) traveled is:

2. **Solution:**
The formula to find the total number of subsets (including the empty set and the set itself) of a set is 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. Since A has 5 elements, the total number of subsets is 2^5 = 32.

However, this includes the empty set and the set A itself. To find the number of proper subsets, we subtract 2 from the total number of subsets (one for the empty set and one for the set itself, but in the context of proper subsets, we specifically exclude the set itself, and the question seems to be asking for all subsets excluding the original set, which would include the empty set as a proper subset in a general mathematical context).

So, the total number of proper subsets, including the empty set but excluding the set itself, is 32 - 1 = 31. 

But considering the common interpretation where both the empty set and the set itself are excluded in a more restrictive definition of ""proper subsets,"" the calculation would be 32 - 2 = 30. 

Given the context of the question seems to focus on the count of subsets excluding the original set (A) and potentially including the empty set as a subset (since the exclusion of the empty set is not explicitly mentioned), we proceed with the understanding that we are looking for all subsets except the set itself, which leads to the count of 31 subsets if we include the empty set as a proper subset, but this understanding might vary based on the specific definition of ""proper subset"" being used.

""A boy travels 3/4 of the circumference of a field with a 20-meter radius. What is the boy's displacement?""

Now, calculate the circumference of the field:
Circumference = 2 * π * radius = 2 * 3.14159 * 20 ≈ 125.6637 meters

The boy travels 3/4 of this circumference:
Distance traveled = (3/4) * Circumference ≈ (3/4) * 125.6637 ≈ 94.7478 meters

Since the boy is traveling in a circular path, his net displacement (the straight-line distance between his starting and ending points) will be less than the distance traveled. However, to find the displacement, we need to understand that traveling 3/4 of the circumference means the boy ends up at a point that is 1/4 of the circumference away from his starting point, in a straight line across the circle (diameter).

Displacement can be considered as the chord of the circular segment he didn't travel, but for a circular path, if you travel a fraction of the circumference, your displacement is directly related to the fraction of the circle's circumference you've traveled and the geometry of the circle. 

The actual question here seems to ask for the distance traveled, given the fraction of the circumference. The displacement in a straight line across the circle (which would be a chord of the arc not traveled) isn't directly asked but can be confusing without a clear definition of ""displacement"" in this context.

""The temperature at which the reading on the Fahrenheit scale is twice the reading on the Celsius scale.""

Now, let's solve the problem. We can represent the temperature in Celsius as C and the temperature in Fahrenheit as F. We are given that F = 2C.

We know that the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is given by the equation: F = (9/5)C + 32.

Since F = 2C, we can set up the equation: 2C = (9/5)C + 32.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2C - (9/5)C = 32.
Combine like terms: (10/5)C - (9/5)C = 32.
Simplify further: (1/5)C = 32.
Multiply both sides by 5: C = 160.

Now, we can find the temperature in Fahrenheit: F = 2C = 2 * 160 = 320.

However, we should verify this result using the original equation: F = (9/5)C + 32.
Substitute C = 160 into the equation: F = (9/5) * 160 + 32 = 288 + 32 = 320.

Since both methods yield the same result, we can conclude that the temperature at which the reading on the Fahrenheit scale is twice the reading on the Celsius scale is indeed related to these calculations, but to directly answer the question with the correct value, we should identify the temperature in the scale that is being asked. Given that F = 2C, if we solve for F and find the corresponding C, the question essentially asks for the value of C when this relationship holds true. However, my initial calculation aimed to find C when F = 2C, leading to an identification of the specific temperature where this occurs.

The reaction is as follows:

N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3

This equation tells us that 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to produce 2 moles of ammonia.

Given that we have 4 liters of nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure (STP), we first need to convert this volume into moles. At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, the number of moles of nitrogen can be calculated as follows:

Moles of N2 = Volume of N2 / 22.4 liters/mole
Moles of N2 = 4 liters / 22.4 liters/mole = 0.1786 moles

From the chemical equation, 1 mole of N2 produces 2 moles of NH3. So, the moles of ammonia produced from 0.1786 moles of nitrogen are:

Moles of NH3 = 2 * Moles of N2
Moles of NH3 = 2 * 0.1786 = 0.3572 moles

To find the volume of ammonia produced at STP, we use the molar volume of an ideal gas (22.4 liters/mole):

Volume of NH3 = Moles of NH3 * 22.4 liters/mole
Volume of NH3 = 0.3572 moles * 22.4 liters/mole = 8.0 liters

Therefore, from 4 liters of nitrogen at STP, 8 liters of ammonia can be produced at the same conditions, assuming the reaction goes to completion and that there is an adequate supply of hydrogen.

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The problem is asking for how many grams of sodium carbonate are needed to make 250 milliliters of a 0.1 molar sodium carbonate solution.""

Next, we need to calculate the amount of sodium carbonate required. 

The molar mass of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is approximately 105.99 g/mol (sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of about 22.99 g/mol, carbon (C) about 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen (O) about 16.00 g/mol, so 2*22.99 + 12.01 + 3*16.00 = 105.99 g/mol).

A 0.1 molar solution means there are 0.1 moles of sodium carbonate per liter of solution.

Since we have 250 mL (or 0.25 liters) of solution, we need:
0.1 moles/L * 0.25 L = 0.025 moles of sodium carbonate.

To find out how many grams this is, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass:
0.025 moles * 105.99 g/mol = 2.64975 grams.

- Oxygen (O2) = 32 g/mol (since atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16 g/mol, and there are two atoms in a molecule of oxygen)
- Magnesium oxide (MgO) = 24.305 g/mol (for Mg) + 16 g/mol (for O) = 40.305 g/mol

Given that we start with 20 grams of magnesium, we can calculate the number of moles of magnesium:

Number of moles of Mg = mass of Mg / atomic mass of Mg

From the reaction equation, 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO. Therefore, the number of moles of MgO produced is equal to the number of moles of Mg reacted, since the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1.

Number of moles of MgO = Number of moles of Mg
≈ 0.822 mol

Now, we calculate the mass of MgO produced:

Mass of MgO = number of moles of MgO * molecular mass of MgO

To solve this, we use the principle of conservation of momentum. The momentum before the collision must be equal to the momentum after the collision. 

The initial momentum of the 3 kg object moving east is 3 kg * 2 m/s = 6 kg*m/s (eastward). 
The initial momentum of the 1 kg object moving west is 1 kg * 2 m/s = 2 kg*m/s (westward), which we can consider as -2 kg*m/s to account for its direction.

The total initial momentum is 6 kg*m/s - 2 kg*m/s = 4 kg*m/s.

After the collision, the two objects merge into one with a total mass of 3 kg + 1 kg = 4 kg.

Let's denote the final velocity of the merged object as V. The momentum after the collision is then 4 kg * V.

Since momentum is conserved, we set the initial and final momenta equal to each other:
4 kg*m/s = 4 kg * V

Solving for V gives us:
V = 4 kg*m/s / 4 kg = 1 m/s

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we convert the initial speed from km/h to m/s:
   Initial speed (v) = 54 km/h = 54 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 15 m/s

2. The distance traveled by the car before it stops is the distance from where the driver sees the pedestrian to where the car stops, which is 46 - 1 = 45 meters.

3. We can use the equation of motion to find the acceleration (a) of the car. The appropriate equation here is v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity (0 m/s, since the car stops), u is the initial velocity (15 m/s), s is the distance traveled (45 meters), and a is the acceleration we're trying to find.

4. Plugging in the values:

   - The volume of the sphere (V) is given by \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.
   - Substituting \( r = 6 \) cm into the equation gives \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (216) = 288\pi \) cubic cm.
   - This volume is equal to the volume of the cylinder. The volume of a cylinder (V) is given by \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \( h \) is its height.
   - We know the height (\( h \)) of the cylinder is 32 cm. So, \( 288\pi = \pi r^2 \times 32 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 288 = 32r^2 \), thus \( r^2 = \frac{288}{32} = 9 \), which means \( r = 3 \) cm.

1. **Translation of the Problem:** The problem asks for the probability of getting a multiple of 3 when a fair die is rolled once.

2. **Identifying Possible Outcomes:** A standard six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6. So, the possible outcomes when rolling the die once are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

3. **Identifying Favorable Outcomes (Multiples of 3):** From the numbers 1 to 6, the multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes.

4. **Calculating Probability:** The formula for probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a multiple of 3 is calculated as follows:
   - Number of favorable outcomes = 2 (since 3 and 6 are the multiples of 3)
   - Total number of possible outcomes = 6 (since there are 6 sides to the die)
   - Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 2/6 = 1/3

Therefore, the probability of rolling a multiple of 3 on a fair six-sided die is 1/3.

The object starts from rest and reaches a velocity of 20 m/s in 5 seconds. 

First, let's calculate the acceleration of the object. We can use the formula: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.

Given that the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s, the final velocity (v) is 20 m/s, and the time (t) is 5 seconds, we can rearrange the formula to find the acceleration: a = (v - u) / t = (20 - 0) / 5 = 4 m/s^2.

Now, we need to find the distance covered in the next 10 seconds. Since the object has already reached a velocity of 20 m/s, we can use the equation of motion: s = ut + 0.5at^2, where s is the distance, u is the initial velocity (which is now 20 m/s), t is the time (10 seconds), and a is the acceleration.

However, since the acceleration is not given for the next 10 seconds, we assume that the object moves with a constant velocity of 20 m/s for the next 10 seconds, as there is no information provided about any change in acceleration.

The distance covered in the next 10 seconds can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time. So, distance = 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters.

The problem states that there is a circle with a radius of 5 cm. An arc of this circle subtends an angle of 60 degrees at the center. We are asked to find the approximate length of this arc.

2. **Solution:**
The formula to find the length of an arc of a circle is given by:
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r \]
where \( \theta \) is the angle at the center of the circle in degrees, and \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Given that \( \theta = 60 \) degrees and \( r = 5 \) cm, we can substitute these values into the formula:

The combustion of magnesium in air produces magnesium oxide. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

From the equation, we see that 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide.

The atomic mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.3 g/mol, and the molecular mass of magnesium oxide (MgO) is approximately 40.3 g/mol.

Given that we have 24 grams of magnesium, we first convert this mass into moles:

moles of Mg = mass of Mg / atomic mass of Mg
moles of Mg = 24 g / 24.3 g/mol ≈ 0.988 mol

Since 2 moles of Mg produce 2 moles of MgO, the number of moles of MgO produced is equal to the number of moles of Mg reacted:

moles of MgO = moles of Mg ≈ 0.988 mol

Now, we convert the moles of MgO into grams:

mass of MgO = moles of MgO * molecular mass of MgO
mass of MgO ≈ 0.988 mol * 40.3 g/mol ≈ 39.83 g

Therefore, approximately 39.83 grams of magnesium oxide will be produced.

""A 40 kg boy climbs 20 stairs, each 16 cm high, to reach the roof in 15 seconds. What is the power of the boy in watts?""

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total height the boy climbed. Since there are 20 stairs, each 16 cm high, the total height climbed is:
20 stairs * 16 cm/stair = 320 cm = 3.2 m (converting cm to m)

2. The boy climbed this height in 15 seconds. To find the power, we need to calculate the work done and then divide it by the time taken.

3. The work done (W) can be calculated using the formula:
W = Force * Distance
Since the force here is the weight of the boy (which is mass * gravity), we can calculate it as:
Force (F) = mass * gravity = 40 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 392 N

4. Now, we calculate the work done:
W = F * distance = 392 N * 3.2 m = 1254.4 J

5. Finally, to find the power (P) in watts, we divide the work done by the time taken:
P = W / time = 1254.4 J / 15 s = 83.6267 W

""A 1 kg object is thrown straight upwards. It falls to the ground after 10 seconds. What will be the potential energy of the object at its maximum height in joules?""

To find the potential energy at the maximum height, we first need to determine the maximum height reached by the object. 

Since the object is thrown upwards, its initial velocity (let's call it v) will decrease due to gravity until it reaches 0 at the maximum height, and then it will start falling back. 

The time it takes for the object to reach its maximum height is half of the total time it takes to fall back to the ground, because the ascent and descent times are equal when air resistance is neglected. Thus, the time to reach the maximum height is 10 / 2 = 5 seconds.

The acceleration due to gravity (g) is approximately 9.81 m/s^2. 

Using the equation for uniformly accelerated motion, v = u + at, where v is the final velocity (0 at the maximum height), u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration (-g for upward motion), and t is the time, we can rearrange to find the initial velocity: 
0 = v - gt, 
v = gt.

However, to find the maximum height (h), we use the equation h = ut + 0.5at^2, but since we don't directly have u (initial velocity) and the question asks for potential energy, we can approach it differently.

Potential energy (PE) at the maximum height is given by PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

The maximum height (h) can also be found using the equation v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v = 0 at the maximum height, u is the initial velocity, a = -g, and s = h. However, since we don't directly know u, let's use another approach related to energy.

At the maximum height, all the initial kinetic energy (0.5mv^2) has been converted into potential energy (mgh). Since we're not given the initial velocity directly, let's consider the relationship between the time it takes to reach the ground and the acceleration due to gravity.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a coin is tossed 2000 times, and out of these tosses, it lands on heads 1030 times. We are asked to find the probability of the coin landing on tails when it is tossed once.

2. **Calculating the Probability:**
- The total number of tosses = 2000
- The number of times the coin lands on heads = 1030
- Therefore, the number of times the coin lands on tails = Total tosses - Number of heads = 2000 - 1030 = 970

The probability of an event happening is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability of getting a tail in one toss is the number of tails divided by the total number of tosses.

Probability of getting a tail = Number of tails / Total number of tosses = 970 / 2000

1. Translation of the problem:
The problem states that a metal solid sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a right circular cylindrical solid with a radius of 3 cm. We need to find the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder.

2. Solution:
The volume of the sphere (V) can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Given the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, the radius (r) is 3 cm.
V = (4/3) * π * (3)^3

Since the sphere is melted to form a cylinder, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder (V) can be calculated using the formula V = π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. Given the radius of the cylinder is 3 cm, we can equate the two volumes:
(4/3) * π * (3)^3 = π * (3)^2 * h

Simplifying the equation:
(4/3) * π * 27 = π * 9 * h
36π = 9πh
h = 36π / 9π
h = 4 cm

Now, we can calculate the curved surface area (CSA) of the cylinder using the formula CSA = 2 * π * r * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
CSA = 2 * π * 3 * 4
CSA = 24π

The molar mass of calcium oxide (CaO) is approximately 56.08 g/mol, the molar mass of calcium (Ca) is approximately 40.08 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O2) is approximately 32 g/mol.

Given that 56 grams of calcium oxide are produced, we can calculate the number of moles of CaO produced:

The reaction between carbon (in the form of coke) and oxygen to produce carbon dioxide can be represented by the chemical equation:

C + O2 → CO2

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of carbon reacts with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 1 mole of carbon dioxide.

The molar masses of carbon (C), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) are approximately 12 g/mol, 32 g/mol, and 44 g/mol, respectively.

Given:
- Mass of coke (C) = 5 g
- Mass of oxygen (O2) = 5 g

First, let's calculate the number of moles of each reactant:
- Moles of C = mass of C / molar mass of C = 5 g / 12 g/mol
- Moles of O2 = mass of O2 / molar mass of O2 = 5 g / 32 g/mol

Calculating these values:
- Moles of C = 5 / 12 ≈ 0.4167 mol
- Moles of O2 = 5 / 32 ≈ 0.15625 mol

From the chemical equation, we see that the reaction between C and O2 is in a 1:1 molar ratio. Therefore, the limiting reactant (the reactant that will be completely consumed first and thus determines the amount of product formed) needs to be identified.

Since 1 mole of C reacts with 1 mole of O2, and there are fewer moles of O2 (0.15625 mol) compared to C (0.4167 mol), O2 is the limiting reactant.

The amount of C that will react with O2 is equal to the number of moles of O2, because of the 1:1 ratio. So, 0.15625 mol of C will react.

To find out how much C is left, we subtract the amount of C that reacted from the total amount of C:
- Amount of C reacted = 0.15625 mol
- Mass of C reacted = moles of C reacted * molar mass of C = 0.15625 mol * 12 g/mol = 1.875 g

Therefore, the amount of C left is:
- Initial mass of C - mass of C reacted = 5 g - 1.875 g = 3.125 g"

Since fluorine is a diatomic molecule (F2), its molecular weight is twice the atomic weight, which is 2 * 19 = 38 grams/mole.

However, the question asks for the molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine, not the molecular weight of a single mole of fluorine gas (F2). 

The molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine (as in F2) would be 19 times the molecular weight of one mole of fluorine gas. 

Therefore, the total weight for 19 moles of fluorine gas (F2) is 19 * 38 = 722 grams.

However, if we are considering 19 moles of fluorine atoms (not fluorine gas, F2), then the calculation would be based on the atomic weight, which is simply 19 * 19 = 361 grams.

Given the context, it seems more appropriate to interpret the question as asking for the total weight of 19 moles of fluorine atoms, since the term ""molecular weight"" might be slightly misused here in the context of the question's wording.

Thus, the total weight of 19 moles of fluorine atoms is 19 * 19 = 361 grams.

The problem translates to: ""54 kilometers/hour is equal to how many meters/second?""

Now, let's solve the problem. We know that 1 kilometer = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. 

So, to convert kilometers/hour to meters/second, we use the following conversion factor:

1 kilometer/hour = (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds)
                  = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds
                  = 5/18 meters/second

Now, we can convert 54 kilometers/hour to meters/second:

54 kilometers/hour = 54 * (5/18) meters/second
                   = 15 meters/second

Therefore, 54 kilometers/hour is equal to 15 meters/second.

The reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O2) to form magnesium oxide (MgO) is as follows:

2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

From the given information, we have 2 grams of magnesium and 2 grams of oxygen. The molar masses of magnesium and oxygen are approximately 24.3 g/mol and 32 g/mol, respectively. The molar mass of magnesium oxide is approximately 40.3 g/mol.

First, let's calculate the number of moles of magnesium and oxygen:

Moles of magnesium = mass of magnesium / molar mass of magnesium
= 2 g / 24.3 g/mol
≈ 0.0823 mol

Moles of oxygen = mass of oxygen / molar mass of oxygen
= 2 g / 32 g/mol
≈ 0.0625 mol

According to the reaction equation, 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen. Since we have approximately 0.0823 mol of magnesium, we would need:

Moles of oxygen required = moles of magnesium / 2
≈ 0.0823 mol / 2
≈ 0.04115 mol

However, we have approximately 0.0625 mol of oxygen available, which is more than needed for the reaction with the given amount of magnesium. This means magnesium is the limiting reactant.

Given that the reaction produces 4 grams of magnesium oxide, let's verify how much magnesium and oxygen should have reacted to produce this amount, considering the stoichiometry of the reaction.

The molar mass of MgO is 40.3 g/mol. So, the number of moles of MgO produced is:

Moles of MgO = mass of MgO / molar mass of MgO
= 4 g / 40.3 g/mol
≈ 0.0993 mol

Since 1 mole of MgO requires 1 mole of Mg and 0.5 moles of O2, the moles of Mg and O2 that reacted are:

Moles of Mg reacted = moles of MgO

Moles of O2 required = moles of MgO / 2

Now, let's solve the problem using the principle of conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system (gun + bullet) is zero since both are initially at rest. After the bullet is fired, the total momentum of the system remains zero, meaning the momentum gained by the bullet is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum gained by the gun.

Let's denote:
- The mass of the gun as \(M = 1\) kg = 1000 grams
- The mass of the bullet as \(m = 5\) grams
- The velocity of the gun as \(V_g = -2\) m/s (negative because it's in the opposite direction to the bullet's velocity)
- The velocity of the bullet as \(V_b\), which we need to find

The momentum of the gun is \(M \times V_g\) and the momentum of the bullet is \(m \times V_b\). Since the total momentum after the shot is zero, we have:
\[M \times V_g + m \times V_b = 0\]

Substituting the given values:
\[1000 \times (-2) + 5 \times V_b = 0\]
\[-2000 + 5V_b = 0\]
\[5V_b = 2000\]
\[V_b = \frac{2000}{5}\]
\[V_b = 400\]

150 grams of water at a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius is mixed with an iron rod at 75 degrees Celsius, and the final temperature is 56 degrees Celsius. The specific heat of water is 4200 J/kg/K, and the specific heat and density of iron are 450 J/kg/K and 7800 kg/m^3, respectively. What is the amount of heat absorbed by the water in Joules?

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of heat transfer, which states that the heat lost by one object is equal to the heat gained by another object.

Let's denote the mass of the iron rod as m. Since we don't know the mass of the iron rod, we'll have to express it in terms of its volume and density.

The volume of the iron rod (V) can be expressed as:
V = m / ρ
where ρ is the density of iron (7800 kg/m^3).

However, we don't know the volume of the iron rod. We can still solve the problem using the given information.

The heat lost by the iron rod (Q_lost) is equal to the heat gained by the water (Q_gained). We can set up an equation using the formula:
Q = mcΔT
where m is the mass, c is the specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

For the iron rod:
Q_lost = m * 450 * (75 - 56)

For the water:
Q_gained = 0.15 * 4200 * (56 - 30)

Since Q_lost = Q_gained, we can set up the equation:
m * 450 * (75 - 56) = 0.15 * 4200 * (56 - 30)

Simplifying the equation:
m * 450 * 19 = 0.15 * 4200 * 26

m * 8550 = 0.15 * 109200

m = (0.15 * 109200) / 8550
m = 1.92 kg (approximately, but we actually don't need the mass of the iron rod to find the heat absorbed by the water)

Now, let's calculate the heat absorbed by the water:
Q_gained = 0.15 * 4200 * 26
Q_gained = 0.15 * 4200 * ("

The expression given is ৬.০২ x ১০^২৩, which translates to ""6.02 x 10^23"" in English, referring to the number of oxygen atoms. 

The atomic mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16 u (unified atomic mass! units), where 1 u = 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

Now, let's calculate the total mass of the given number of oxygen atoms:
Mass of one oxygen atom = 16 u
Number of oxygen atoms = 6.02 x 10^23

Total mass = Number of oxygen atoms * Mass of one oxygen atom
Total mass = 6.02 x 10^23 * 16

First, calculate the multiplication:
6.02 * 16 = 96.32

Then, apply the exponent:
Total mass = 96.32 x 10^23

Since 1 u = 1.66 x 10^-27 kilograms (approximating the value for simplicity), 
we convert the mass into kilograms:
Total mass in kilograms = 96.32 x 10^23 * 1.66 x 10^-27 kg

Calculate the multiplication and apply the exponents:
Total mass in kilograms = 96.32 * 1.66 x 10^(-27+23) kg
Total mass in kilograms = 160.0912 x 10^-4 kg
Total mass in kilograms ≈ 0.01600912 x 10^1 kg or simply 1.600912 kg

Thus, the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen atoms is approximately 1.600912 kilograms, but given the context, we'll provide the answer in the most straightforward numerical form related to the calculation directly answering the question without additional conversion:

Translation: A spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half-submerged in water and floating. What is the buoyancy of the sphere?

Now, let's solve the problem. 

The volume of the sphere (V) is given as 200 cubic meters. Since the sphere is half-submerged in water, the volume of the water displaced (V') is half the volume of the sphere, which is 100 cubic meters.

According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyancy (B) of an object is equal to the weight of the fluid (in this case, water) displaced by the object. 

The weight of the water displaced can be calculated as the volume of the water displaced multiplied by the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m^3). 

However, the question asks for the buoyancy, not the weight. In terms of volume, since the object is half-submerged, it displaces a volume of water equal to half its own volume. The buoyancy, in terms of the force exerted, would be equivalent to the weight of this displaced water, but the question seems to be asking for the volume or a direct measure related to the sphere's buoyancy, which isn't fully clear without specifying if it's asking for force (weight) or volume. 

Given the information and typical interpretations of such questions, the ""buoyancy"" in a basic sense could refer to the volume of water displaced, which directly relates to the principle of buoyancy. Since the sphere displaces 100 cubic meters of water and buoyancy is about the interaction with the fluid (here, water), we might interpret the question as asking for this volume as a measure of the sphere's buoyancy effect.

Thus, the buoyancy, in terms of the volume of water displaced (which is a direct measure of the buoyant effect), is 100 cubic meters.

A semimolar solution is one that contains half a mole of solute per liter of solution. Since we're dealing with a 200 mL (or 0.2 L) solution and want it to be semimolar, we calculate the amount of solute (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) needed.

The molecular weight of NaOH is approximately 40 grams per mole (Na = 23 g/mol, O = 16 g/mol, H = 1 g/mol). 

For a semimolar solution in 1 liter, we would need 0.5 moles of NaOH. Since the solution volume is 0.2 liters, we adjust our calculation accordingly:

0.5 moles/L * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of NaOH needed for 0.2 L to be semimolar.

Given that 1 mole of NaOH weighs 40 grams, 0.1 moles would weigh:

The problem states that based on the principle of mechanical advantage, in a hydraulic press, the diameter of the larger piston is made 8 times that of the smaller piston. We need to find out how many times greater the force will be felt on the larger piston.

2. **Understanding the Principle:**
The principle of a hydraulic press is based on Pascal's law, which states that the pressure applied to a fluid in a closed system is transmitted equally in all directions. In a hydraulic press, the force applied to the smaller piston is transmitted to the larger piston through the fluid. The force amplification depends on the ratio of the areas of the two pistons.

3. **Calculating the Force Ratio:**
The area of a piston is given by \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the piston. If the diameter of the larger piston is 8 times that of the smaller piston, then its radius is also 8 times larger because diameter = 2 * radius.

Let the radius of the smaller piston be \(r\), and thus the radius of the larger piston is \(8r\).

The area of the smaller piston is \(A_{small} = \pi r^2\).

The area of the larger piston is \(A_{large} = \pi (8r)^2 = \pi 64r^2 = 64 \pi r^2\).

Since the pressure (force per unit area) is the same in both pistons, the force ratio is equal to the area ratio. Therefore, the force on the larger piston is \(64\) times the force on the smaller piston because \(A_{large} / A_{small} = 64\).

   - Since the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder, we have 36π = 4πR^2.
   - Simplifying, R^2 = 36π / 4π = 9.
   - Hence, R = √9 = 3 cm.

1. The main scale of a slide calipers has 19 divisions equal to 20 divisions on the Vernier scale.
2. When a small rod is placed between the two jaws, the zero mark of the Vernier scale coincides with the 5.2 cm mark on the main scale.
3. The 14th mark on the Vernier scale coincides with a mark on the main scale.

First, let's calculate the least count of the Vernier scale. Since 19 divisions on the main scale are equal to 20 divisions on the Vernier scale, and assuming each division on the main scale represents 1 cm (as the problem mentions 5.2 cm which implies the main scale is in centimeters), we have:

- 19 cm on the main scale = 20 divisions on the Vernier scale
- Least count of Vernier scale = (1 main scale division) / (number of Vernier scale divisions that equal 1 main scale division)
  = 1 cm / 20
  = 0.05 cm or 0.5 mm per Vernier scale division.

Given that the zero mark of the Vernier scale is beyond the 5.2 cm mark on the main scale, and the 14th mark on the Vernier scale coincides with a mark on the main scale, we need to find out where exactly the end of the rod lies on the main scale.

Since 14 divisions on the Vernier scale would be 14 * 0.05 cm = 0.7 cm beyond a whole number on the main scale, and considering the initial position (5.2 cm), the Vernier scale's zero mark being at 5.2 cm implies the additional length beyond 5.2 cm that we need to add to the whole number is given by the Vernier reading.

However, the key information here is that the Vernier scale's 14th mark aligns with a main scale mark, which indicates we have moved 0.7 cm beyond a whole number on the main scale. Given that we start measuring from the 5.2 cm mark (where the Vernier zero is), and we are trying to find where the rod's end falls:

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a 0.125 molar solution of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is prepared in 750 milliliters (mL) of solution. We are asked to find out how many grams of potassium carbonate are in the solution.

2. **Understanding Molarity:**
Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The formula for molarity is M = moles of solute / liters of solution. Given that the molarity of the potassium carbonate solution is 0.125 M, we can use this information to find the number of moles of potassium carbonate in 750 mL (or 0.75 liters) of solution.

3. **Calculating Moles of Potassium Carbonate:**
Given M = 0.125 M and the volume of the solution (V) = 750 mL = 0.75 L, we can rearrange the molarity formula to find the number of moles (n) of potassium carbonate: n = M * V = 0.125 M * 0.75 L = 0.09375 moles.

4. **Molar Mass of Potassium Carbonate:**
The molar mass of K2CO3 can be calculated by summing the atomic masses of its constituent atoms: potassium (K) has an atomic mass of approximately 39 g/mol, carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12 g/mol, and oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of K2CO3 = (2*39) + 12 + (3*16) = 78 + 12 + 48 = 138 g/mol.

5. **Calculating the Mass of Potassium Carbonate:**
To find the mass of potassium carbonate in grams, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass: mass = moles * molar mass = 0.09375 moles * 138 g/mol = 12.9375 g.

The problem states that the smallest division on the main scale of a slide caliper is 1 mm. It also mentions that the Vernier scale has 10 divisions. We are asked to find the value of the Vernier constant in centimeters.

2. **Understanding the Scales:**
- The main scale is divided into millimeters (mm), with each smallest division being 1 mm.
- The Vernier scale is used to measure fractions of a millimeter by sliding along the main scale. It has 10 divisions.

3. **Calculating the Vernier Constant:**

However, given the usual mistranslation and confusion, if ""ইথিন"" refers to something else, please clarify. For the sake of the problem, assuming ""ইথিন"" refers to Nitrogen or any other element/molecule, we will consider ""ইথিন"" as Nitrogen for calculation simplicity).

The atomic mass of Nitrogen (N) is approximately 14 u (unified atomic mass units). The molecular mass of Nitrogen gas (N2) would be 2 * 14 u = 28 u per molecule.

Since the problem asks for the molecular weight of 7 moles of Nitrogen (considering N2 for molecular weight), and 1 mole of any substance contains approximately 6.022 * 10^23 molecules (Avogadro's number), we don't need the Avogadro's number for calculating the total molecular weight of 7 moles, as it directly depends on the molecular weight of one mole.

The molecular weight of 1 mole of N2 = 28 g (since atomic mass is in u, which is 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom, and the molecular weight in grams per mole is the same number as the molecular mass in u).

2. Solution: 
The second hand of a clock completes one full revolution every minute. 
A full revolution is 360 degrees, and the distance covered by the second hand in one full revolution is equal to the circumference of a circle with radius equal to the length of the second hand.

However, the problem doesn't specify the length of the second hand. 
Since a standard clock has a second hand of length around 10-15 cm (assuming a typical wall clock size), let's consider the length of the second hand to be roughly 0.1 meters for simplicity.

The circumference C of a circle is calculated using the formula C = 2 * π * r, where r is the radius of the circle.

So, the distance covered by the second hand in one full revolution (or one minute) would be:
C = 2 * π * 0.1 meters
C ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 0.1 meters
C ≈ 0.62832 meters

The reaction between sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented by the equation:

Na2CO3 + 2HCl -> 2NaCl + H2O + CO2

Given:
- 10 ml of 0.2 molar sodium carbonate solution.
- We need to find out how many grams of 0.1 molar (decimolar) hydrochloric acid are required to neutralize the sodium carbonate.

First, let's calculate the number of moles of sodium carbonate in 10 ml of 0.2 molar solution:

Number of moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
Since 10 ml = 0.01 liters,
Number of moles of Na2CO3 = 0.2 M * 0.01 L = 0.002 moles

According to the reaction, 1 mole of Na2CO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl. So, for 0.002 moles of Na2CO3, we need:

Number of moles of HCl = 2 * Number of moles of Na2CO3
= 2 * 0.002
= 0.004 moles

The molar mass of HCl is approximately 36.46 g/mol.

Given that we have a 0.1 molar (decimolar) solution of HCl, we want to find out the volume of this solution that contains 0.004 moles of HCl. The volume of the solution can be calculated as:

2. **Solution:**
According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyant force (or upthrust) exerted on an object immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid the object displaces. For an object to float, it must displace a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. The percentage of the object that is submerged depends on the ratio of its density to the density of the fluid.

- Density of water = 1 x 10^3 kg/m^3

The ratio of the density of wood to the density of water is 0.40 x 10^3 / 1 x 10^3 = 0.4. This means that the wood will displace a volume of water that weighs the same as the wood itself, which is 40% of the weight of the same volume of water.

Since the wood displaces 40% of its volume in water to equal its weight, 40% of the wood's volume will be submerged, and the remaining 60% will be above water.

2. We are given a 0.2 molar solution, which means there are 0.2 moles of NaCl per liter of solution.
3. We need to prepare 500 milliliters (or 0.5 liters) of this solution.
4. The number of moles of NaCl needed is 0.2 moles/liter * 0.5 liters = 0.1 moles.
5. To find the mass of NaCl needed, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass: 0.1 moles * 58.44 grams/mole = 5.844 grams.

Therefore, to prepare 500 milliliters of a 0.2 molar solution, we need approximately 5.844 grams of common salt.

Translation: A rod is placed between the two jaws of a slide caliper, and the reading obtained is: main scale 6 cm, vernier scale coincidence 4, and vernier constant 0.1 mm.

Given:
- Main scale reading = 6 cm
- Vernier scale coincidence = 4
- Vernier constant = 0.1 mm

The vernier constant is the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division. To find the length of the rod, we first convert all measurements to the same unit, preferably millimeters for ease of calculation with the vernier constant.

1 cm = 10 mm, so 6 cm = 60 mm.

The vernier scale coincidence of 4 means that the 4th division on the vernier scale coincides with a division on the main scale. Given the vernier constant is 0.1 mm, this means each vernier division is 0.1 mm less than each main scale division.

Since the main scale division is 1 mm (because 1 cm = 10 mm, and thus 1 main scale division is 1 mm when we're considering measurements in millimeters), and if we consider the difference that the vernier scale measures (which is the vernier constant), we calculate the additional length measured by the vernier scale as follows:

Additional length = Vernier scale coincidence * Vernier constant
= 4 * 0.1 mm
= 0.4 mm

Now, to find the total length of the rod, we add the main scale reading in millimeters to the additional length measured by the vernier scale:

Total length = Main scale reading + Additional length
= 60 mm + 0.4 mm
= 60.4 mm

To convert this into centimeters, since 1 cm = 10 mm:

Total length in cm = 60.4 mm / 10
= 6.04 cm

Therefore, the length of the rod is 6.04 cm.

The reaction between hydrogen gas (H2) and nitrogen gas (N2) produces ammonia (NH3). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3

From the given information:
- Mass of hydrogen gas (H2) = 5 grams
- Mass of nitrogen gas (N2) = 30 grams

First, let's calculate the number of moles of each gas to determine the limiting reactant. The molar mass of H2 is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of N2 is approximately 28 grams/mole.

Number of moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molar mass of H2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 moles
Number of moles of N2 = mass of N2 / molar mass of N2 = 30 / 28 ≈ 1.07 moles

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of N2 reacts with 3 moles of H2. Therefore, the number of moles of H2 required to react with 1.07 moles of N2 is:
1.07 moles of N2 * 3 moles of H2 / 1 mole of N2 = 3.21 moles of H2

Since we only have 2.5 moles of H2, which is less than the 3.21 moles required, H2 is the limiting reactant.

Now, let's calculate the mass of ammonia (NH3) produced. The molar mass of NH3 is approximately 17 grams/mole. From the balanced equation, 3 moles of H2 produce 2 moles of NH3.

Number of moles of NH3 produced = 2/3 * number of moles of H2 = 2/3 * 2.5 = 1.67 moles

Mass of NH3 produced = number of moles of NH3 * molar mass of NH3 = 1.67 * 17 ≈ 28.39 grams

However, to find the total mass of the products, we also need to consider the unused nitrogen. Since H2 is the limiting reactant, N2 will be in excess.

Number of moles of N2 that react = number of moles of H2 / 3 = 2.5 / "

Now, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.
2. Given the radius \(r = 10\) meters, we can calculate the circumference: \(C = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi\) meters.
3. One-fourth of the circumference is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\pi = 5\pi\) meters.
4. The displacement when traversing one-fourth of the circumference of the circular path is equal to the length of the arc, which is \(5\pi\) meters.

""The probability of not getting two heads when two coins are tossed together is what?""

Now, let's consider the possible outcomes when two coins are tossed. Each coin can land in one of two ways: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for two coins, the possible outcomes are:
1. HH (both heads)
2. HT (first coin heads, second coin tails)
3. TH (first coin tails, second coin heads)
4. TT (both tails)

There are 4 possible outcomes in total, and only one of them is HH (both heads). Therefore, the probability of getting two heads is 1/4.

The probability of not getting two heads is the opposite of getting two heads. Since the probability of an event happening plus the probability of the event not happening is 1, we can find the probability of not getting two heads by subtracting the probability of getting two heads from 1.

So, the probability of not getting two heads is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

The reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2) produces sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and water (H2O). The chemical equation for this reaction is:

2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O

Given:
- Mass of NaOH = 10 grams
- Mass of CO2 = 5 grams

First, we need to find the molar masses of NaOH and CO2 to proceed with the stoichiometry of the reaction.
- Molar mass of NaOH = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol
- Molar mass of CO2 = 12 (C) + 2*16 (O) = 44 g/mol
- Molar mass of Na2CO3 = 2*23 (Na) + 12 (C) + 3*16 (O) = 106 g/mol

Now, let's calculate the number of moles of NaOH and CO2:
- Moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol
- Moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2 = 5 g / 44 g/mol = 0.1136 mol (approximately)

From the chemical equation, we see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2 to produce 1 mole of Na2CO3. Therefore, the limiting reactant needs to be identified.

Since 0.1136 mol of CO2 would require 2*0.1136 = 0.2272 mol of NaOH to completely react, and we have 0.25 mol of NaOH, CO2 is the limiting reactant because we don't have enough NaOH to react with all the CO2 if we were considering the stoichiometric amounts needed for complete reaction based on the provided masses. However, given the amounts, NaOH is in excess because CO2 will be completely consumed in the reaction.

Thus, all of the CO2 (0.1136 mol) will react. The reaction produces 1 mole of Na2CO3 for every mole of CO2 that reacts. Therefore, the moles of Na2CO3 produced = moles of CO2"

The height of the cylinder will be equal to the diameter of the ball, which is 8 cm, because the ball touches the top and bottom of the cylinder.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.
