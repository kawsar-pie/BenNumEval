Translation: Tahsan bought two and a half dozen eggs from a shop at 120 taka per dozen and went home. After going home, he saw that 3 eggs were damaged. However, how much money did Tahsan lose?

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Tahsan bought 2.5 dozen eggs.
2. The price per dozen eggs is 120 taka.
3. To find the total cost of the eggs, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen: 2.5 * 120 = 300 taka.
4. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 2.5 dozen eggs equal 2.5 * 12 = 30 eggs.
5. Out of 30 eggs, 3 eggs were damaged.
6. The cost of one egg can be found by dividing the total cost by the total number of eggs: 300 / 30 = 10 taka per egg.
7. Therefore, the loss due to the 3 damaged eggs is 3 * 10 = 30 taka.

""Soni starts donating 8 thousand rupees to an institution on Soni's birthday at the age of 17. Yesterday, Soni became 71 years old. How many thousand rupees has Soni donated so far?""

Now, let's solve the problem. Soni started donating at the age of 17 and has been donating until the age of 71. To find out how many years Soni has been donating, we subtract the starting age from the current age:

71 (current age) - 17 (starting age) = 54 years

Since Soni donates 8 thousand rupees every year, the total amount donated can be calculated by multiplying the number of years by the annual donation amount:

54 years * 8 thousand rupees/year = 432 thousand rupees

Therefore, the total amount donated by Soni is 432 thousand rupees.

""Mina walks 200 meters in 4 minutes. How many meters can she walk in half an hour?""

Now, let's break it down:
1. First, we find out how many meters Mina walks per minute. Since she walks 200 meters in 4 minutes, we divide the distance by the time to get the speed per minute: 200 meters / 4 minutes = 50 meters per minute.

The problem is about Alexander writing the alphabet on a sheet of paper and specifically asks how many sheets of paper are needed to write the vowels.

1. **Translation**: The problem translates to ""Alexander needs a sheet of paper to write an alphabet. How many sheets of paper are needed to write the vowels?""

2. **Understanding the Alphabet and Vowels**: The English alphabet consists of 26 letters, out of which 5 letters (A, E, I, O, U) are considered vowels in the basic definition. Sometimes, Y is also considered a vowel in certain contexts, but for simplicity, we'll stick to the basic 5 vowels.

3. **Calculating Sheets Needed for Vowels**: Since Alexander needs one sheet of paper for the entire alphabet, and assuming each letter (regardless of being a vowel or consonant) requires the same amount of space, the question essentially asks for the proportion of the alphabet that are vowels.

However, the question seems to imply a simplistic model where the entire alphabet requires one sheet, suggesting a direct count rather than a proportion. Given this interpretation, and assuming each vowel requires the same space as any other letter, and knowing there are 5 vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in the English alphabet:

- If we consider the space for one alphabet (26 letters) equals one sheet, then the space for one letter would be 1/26 of a sheet.
- For 5 vowels, it would be 5 * (1/26) = 5/26 of a sheet.

Since the problem likely intends a more straightforward interpretation (given its simplistic nature), and it does not specify the size of the sheet or the writing, a direct numerical answer based on the provided information and typical interpretations of such problems would not follow the standard mathematical calculation but rather a logical deduction based on the given constraints.

""Rafiq went home from the shop buying half a dozen eggs at 14 taka each. After going home, he saw that 3 eggs were broken. However, how much did Rafiq spend?""

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent by Rafiq. 
First, we need to determine how many eggs Rafiq bought. Since he bought half a dozen eggs, we know that 1 dozen = 12 eggs. Therefore, half a dozen eggs = 12 / 2 = 6 eggs.

The cost of each egg is 14 taka. So, the total cost = number of eggs * cost per egg = 6 * 14 = 84 taka.

The fact that 3 eggs were broken does not affect the amount spent by Rafiq, as he had already paid for the eggs.

Therefore, the total amount spent by Rafiq is 84 taka.

""Translation: A machine is cutting branches and processing apples. If I see 204 branches after 6 hours, how many apples have been processed?""

Now, let's break down the information given:

1. The machine cuts branches and processes apples.
2. After 6 hours, 204 branches have been cut.

However, there's no direct information provided about the rate at which the machine cuts branches or processes apples, nor is there a comparison or correlation between the number of branches cut and the number of apples processed. 

Given the information, we cannot directly calculate the number of apples processed because there's no basis for comparison or conversion between branches cut and apples processed. The problem as stated lacks specific details necessary for determining the number of apples processed based on the number of branches cut.

Therefore, without additional data such as the rate of processing for both branches and apples, or a direct relationship between the two, we cannot accurately determine the number of apples that have been processed.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states that in a steel mill, 24,000 metric tons of rods are produced in a month. We need to find out how much rod is produced daily in that mill.""

2. Since a month can have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, we'll assume an average month for simplicity, which is often taken as 30 days for such calculations.

Total production in a month = 24,000 metric tons
Number of days in the month (for calculation purposes) = 30 days

Daily production = Total production in a month / Number of days in the month
Daily production = 24,000 metric tons / 30 days
Daily production = 800 metric tons per day

Therefore, the daily production of rods in the mill is 800 metric tons.

""There are three bells of different colors. The red bell rings every 18 minutes, the yellow bell rings every 15 minutes, and the green bell rings every 12 minutes. If the bells rang together at 6 PM, when will they ring together again at night?""

To find the time when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18, 15, and 12 minutes.

First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors:
- 18 = 2 * 3^2
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 12 = 2^2 * 3

Now, to find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^2 (from 12)
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 18)
- The highest power of 5 is 5 (from 15)

So, the LCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

Therefore, if the bells rang together at 6 PM, they will ring together again at 9 PM.

Total cost = 69 * 4
Total cost = 276

Therefore, the total cost of fencing the square is 276 taka.

1. Translation of the problem: Amelia has painted all the outer faces of 6 identical cubic objects. How many faces has Amelia painted in total?

2. Solution: Each cube has 6 faces. However, when these cubes are placed together to form a larger cube (since they are identical and the problem implies they are joined in such a way), some of the faces will be inner faces, not outer faces. 

For 6 cubes arranged in a cubic shape (2x3 or any similar configuration), the total number of outer faces can be calculated by first finding the total number of faces if all cubes were separate and then subtracting the faces that become inner faces when they are joined.

- Total faces for 6 separate cubes = 6 cubes * 6 faces/cube = 36 faces
- When the cubes are arranged to form a larger solid, the faces that touch each other become inner faces. For a 2x3 arrangement (or any similar cubic arrangement), there are 5 inner faces touching each other in a line (for the 3 cubes in a line, 2 touches * 2 lines = 4, plus one touch between the two lines of 3 cubes, which is a simplification and may vary depending on exact configuration). However, considering the cubes are arranged to minimize the number of exposed faces (which would naturally happen in a cubic or rectangular solid arrangement), we'll consider a configuration that minimizes inner faces exposed.

A more accurate approach: 
- Consider the cubes forming a solid shape, such as a 2x3 rectangular solid. The outer faces of this solid would be:
  - The two ends (2 faces * 3 cubes in each face = 6 faces, but since these faces are on the outside, they indeed count towards the outer faces, though each face of a cube contributes to these counts)
  - The top and bottom (2 faces * 2x3 = 6 faces for the top and 6 for the bottom, but again, this overcounts because it doesn't account for shared edges)
  - The sides (there are 4 sides, each with 2x3 or 3x2 faces, which actually simplifies to counting the faces correctly)

To correct and simplify the calculation:
- For a rectangular solid made of 6 cubes (in a 2x3 configuration), the total outer faces are the faces"

Translation: At the end of the month, Sadi was calculating his expenses for April. He found that he spent a total of 420 taka on burgers. If Sadi eats the same number of burgers every day, how much does he spend on burgers per day?

Now, let's solve the problem. Since April has 30 days, we can calculate Sadi's daily expenditure on burgers by dividing the total expenditure by the number of days.

Total expenditure on burgers = 420 taka
Number of days in April = 30

Daily expenditure on burgers = Total expenditure on burgers / Number of days in April
= 420 / 30
= 14

Therefore, Sadi spends 14 taka on burgers per day.

""Translation: There is a 32-hour train from the East Coast to the West Coast. If the train starts its journey at dawn on Saturday from the East Coast, on which day will it reach its destination?""

Now, let's break down the solution:

- The train travels for 32 hours.
- It starts on Saturday at dawn.

Since 24 hours make a day, after 24 hours, it will be Sunday. The remaining 8 hours will then be added to Sunday. 

So, if the train starts at dawn (let's say around 5 or 6 AM for simplicity) on Saturday and travels for 32 hours, it will reach its destination on Sunday, 8 hours after dawn. 

Given that a typical dawn time is around 5-6 AM, adding 8 hours to this would place the arrival time at around 1-2 PM on Sunday.

Therefore, the train will reach its destination on Sunday.

1. Translation of the problem:
Tahsan went home from the shop after buying a dozen eggs for 132 taka. After reaching home, he found 3 eggs were broken. However, how much money did Tahsan lose?

2. Solution:
First, let's find out the cost of one egg. Since Tahsan bought a dozen eggs (12 eggs) for 132 taka, the cost per egg can be calculated as follows:
Cost per egg = Total cost / Number of eggs
Cost per egg = 132 taka / 12 eggs
Cost per egg = 11 taka per egg

Now, we know that 3 eggs were broken. So, the total loss incurred by Tahsan can be calculated by multiplying the number of broken eggs by the cost per egg:
Total loss = Number of broken eggs * Cost per egg
Total loss = 3 eggs * 11 taka per egg
Total loss = 33 taka

Therefore, Tahsan lost 33 taka due to the broken eggs.

1. Translation of the problem:
""The price of a chocolate is 2 taka. During Christmas, there was a discount of 57 paise at the cost price. What is the cost price of the chocolate?""

2. Solution:
First, we need to convert the discount from paise to taka, knowing that 1 taka = 100 paise.
- Discount = 57 paise = 57 / 100 = 0.57 taka.

The selling price (SP) of the chocolate is 2 taka, and there was a discount of 0.57 taka on the cost price (CP). We can express this relationship as:
- SP = CP - Discount
- 2 = CP - 0.57

To find the cost price (CP), we rearrange the equation:
- CP = SP + Discount
- CP = 2 + 0.57
- CP = 2.57 taka

Therefore, the cost price of the chocolate is 2.57 taka.

""There are 8 animals on a farm. Some are ducks and some are dogs. The total number of legs of all the animals is 24. How many ducks are there?""

Now, let's denote the number of ducks as D and the number of dogs as G. We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 8, so D + G = 8.
2. Ducks have 2 legs and dogs have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 24, so 2D + 4G = 24.

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2, getting:
D + 2G = 12.

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this one to find G:
(D + 2G) - (D + G) = 12 - 8
G = 4.

Now that we know there are 4 dogs, we can substitute this back into the first equation to find D:
D + G = 8
D + 4 = 8
D = 4

Therefore, there are 4 ducks.

Translation: Samuel joins coaching on New Year's Day. Samuel takes coaching every day from November 4th until Samuel fails or the coaching closes. How much coaching fee will Samuel have to pay, if the daily coaching charge is 23 taka and the year is not a leap year?

Now, let's calculate the total number of days Samuel attended coaching. Since the year is not a leap year, it has 365 days. Samuel attended coaching from January 1st to November 4th, which is a total of 308 days (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 4).

The daily coaching charge is 23 taka. Therefore, the total coaching fee Samuel has to pay is:

Total fee = Daily charge * Number of days
Total fee = 23 * 308
Total fee = 7074

However, we should also consider that Samuel attended coaching from January 1st to December 31st, but the coaching was closed from November 4th to December 31st. So, the correct calculation is:

Total fee = 23 * (365 - 57)  # 57 days from November 4th to December 31st
Total fee = 23 * 308

But since the coaching stopped on November 4th, we only count the days until then:
January has 31 days, February has 28 days (not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, and November has 4 days. 

So, the correct total is:
31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 4 = 308 days.

Thus, the correct total fee is:
Total fee = 23 * 308

""Jonathan spends 8 hours every day on his phone. If half of this time is spent on social media. How much time does he spend on social media in a week?""

Now, let's break down the problem. Jonathan spends 8 hours a day on his phone, and half of that time is spent on social media. So, the daily time spent on social media is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on social media in a week is 4 hours/day * 7 days/week = 28 hours.

Therefore, Jonathan spends 28 hours on social media in a week.

""Abir's mother said that Jisan's birthday is in the month after April, but Abir is one month older than Jisan. What is the probability that Jisan's birthday is in June?""

Now, let's analyze the situation:
- Jisan's birthday must be after April, which means it can be in May, June, July, August, September, October, November, or December.
- Since Abir is one month older than Jisan, if Jisan's birthday is in May, Abir's birthday would be in April, which contradicts the condition that Jisan's birthday is after April. Therefore, Jisan's birthday cannot be in May.
- For Jisan's birthday to be after May and Abir to be one month older, Jisan's birthday must be in June, and Abir's birthday would be in May.
- Any birthday for Jisan after June would make Abir more than one month older if we try to satisfy the condition of being one month apart and after April.

Given the information, the only month that satisfies both conditions (Jisan's birthday after April and Abir being exactly one month older) is June for Jisan and May for Abir. 

However, we need to consider all possible months after April for Jisan's birthday, which are May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December. But based on the one-month age difference, only June fits perfectly for Jisan's birthday to be after April and Abir to be exactly one month older.

Therefore, since there's only one valid option (June) out of the 8 possible months from May to December (since April is excluded as per the statement), the probability can be considered as 1 out of the number of months that fit the ""after April"" criterion but considering the specific age difference and conditions given, the calculation of probability might be misunderstood.

Correctly, the problem suggests a specific scenario rather than asking for a probability from a range of equally likely outcomes. Hence, the question seems to aim at understanding the logical deduction of Jisan's possible birthday month given the conditions rather than calculating a traditional probability.

Given this logical framework and understanding of the question, the probability or the likelihood of Jisan's birthday being in June, under the constraints provided, is actually certain if we strictly follow the conditions that Abir is exactly one month older and Jisan's birthday is after April.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
Sebastian works every day and gets paid 1043 taka on a weekly basis. If Sebastian does not go to work for 2 days this week, how much salary will he get?

2. Calculate Sebastian's daily wage:
Sebastian's weekly salary = 1043 taka
Since there are 7 days in a week, we assume he works all 7 days.
Daily wage = Weekly salary / 7
Daily wage = 1043 / 7
Daily wage = 149 taka

3. Calculate Sebastian's salary for this week if he doesn't work for 2 days:
Salary for 5 days = Daily wage * 5
Salary for 5 days = 149 * 5
Salary for 5 days = 745 taka

Therefore, Sebastian will get 745 taka if he doesn't work for 2 days this week.

1. Robert started preparing in January for the GRE entrance exam.
2. He prepared until the 4th of a month when he had his written exam.

Given that Robert started preparing in January and had his exam on the 4th of a month, we need to consider when the GRE exam could take place, assuming it's a one-time exam in a specific month after January.

The problem doesn't explicitly state the timing of the GRE exam in relation to months after January or the exact preparation period. However, considering typical exam schedules and assuming the GRE exam doesn't take place in the same month he started preparing (January), Robert would prepare in January for an exam potentially scheduled in a subsequent month.

If the written exam was on the 4th of a month following January, and assuming a typical preparation period, the most straightforward answer without additional context about GRE exam schedules would be February, as it's the next month after January and the exam date (4th) is plausible for early February, allowing a preparation period that started in January.

1. Each duck has 2 legs, and each horse has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals (ducks + horses) is 15.
3. The total number of legs is 48.

We can set up two equations based on this information:
1. D + H = 15 (total number of animals)
2. 2D + 4H = 48 (total number of legs)

We can solve these equations to find the number of horses (H). 

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
D + 2H = 24

1. Translation of the problem:
Tahsan went home after buying three and a half dozen eggs from the store at 120 rupees per dozen. After getting home, he found 8 eggs were damaged. However, how much did Tahsan lose?

2. Solution:
First, we calculate the total number of eggs Tahsan bought. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, three and a half dozen eggs equal 3.5 * 12 = 42 eggs.

The total cost of the eggs is 3.5 dozen * 120 rupees per dozen = 3.5 * 120 = 420 rupees.

Since 8 eggs were damaged, we need to find out the cost of these 8 eggs to determine the loss. The cost per egg is the total cost divided by the total number of eggs, which is 420 rupees / 42 eggs = 10 rupees per egg.

Therefore, the loss incurred due to the 8 damaged eggs is 8 eggs * 10 rupees per egg = 80 rupees.

""Elias directs each student in the class to sketch a Roman numeral according to their roll number. The student with roll number 1 will sketch the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 will sketch the second Roman numeral, and so on. Finally, Elias collects all the sketches and finds that there are 6 sketches of each Roman numeral. How many students were in the class?""

Now, let's analyze the situation to determine the number of students. Since each Roman numeral has 6 sketches, it indicates that the number of students is a multiple of 6 because each student sketches one Roman numeral, and the sequence of Roman numerals repeats after a certain number of students.

The first few Roman numerals are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, which represent the numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000, respectively. However, the actual sequence isn't directly relevant to solving the problem; what matters is that there are 6 sketches of each Roman numeral.

Given that each Roman numeral has 6 sketches, this implies that the class has a number of students that allows for each numeral to be sketched 6 times. Therefore, if we divide the total number of sketches by 6 (since each numeral is sketched 6 times), we should get the total number of unique Roman numerals that were assigned.

However, the problem doesn't specify the exact Roman numerals or their order. Instead, it focuses on the fact that each student gets a unique Roman numeral based on their roll number, and there are 6 sketches of each numeral. This suggests that the sequence of numerals is long enough that it can be divided into sets of 6 unique numerals.

Since each numeral from 1 to some n has been sketched 6 times, we can infer that there are at least 6 students for each unique Roman numeral. But to find the total number of students, we need to consider how many unique numerals there are.

Given that we are looking for the total number of students and knowing that each numeral has 6 sketches, we can infer the total number of unique Roman numerals isn't as crucial as understanding that each student contributes one sketch. The critical insight here is that if there are 6 sketches of each numeral, the number of students must be divisible by 6, given the one-to"

101,(৫ ঘণ্টা ৩৩ মিনিট ) - ( ১ ঘণ্টা ৩৩ মিনিট ) = কত ঘন্টা?,৪,"To solve this problem, we first need to translate it into English for clarity.

The problem in English is: (5 hours 33 minutes) - (1 hour 33 minutes) = how many hours?

Now, let's solve the problem. 

First, convert both times into just minutes for easier calculation:
- 5 hours 33 minutes = (5 * 60) + 33 = 300 + 33 = 333 minutes
- 1 hour 33 minutes = (1 * 60) + 33 = 60 + 33 = 93 minutes

Then, subtract the two times in minutes:
333 minutes - 93 minutes = 240 minutes

1. **Translation of the problem in English:** If it costs 79 Taka to fence each side of a square, what is the total cost of fencing?

2. **Solution:** 
   - The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where P is the perimeter and s is the length of one side.
   - Given that the cost to fence each side (s) is 79 Taka, we substitute s in the perimeter formula with 79 to find the total cost for fencing the entire square.

1. **Translation of the problem**: The problem states that Jisan's birthday is in March. We need to find the probability that March 31st is Jisan's birthday.

2. **Solution**: Since March has 31 days, and assuming every day is equally likely to be Jisan's birthday, the probability that his birthday is on the 31st can be calculated as follows:

- Total number of days in March = 31
- Favorable outcome (31st of March) = 1

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)

Probability = 1 / 31

So, the probability that March 31st is Jisan's birthday is 1/31.

She stands in a row at the entrance gate, from where she can see the legs of the farm animals and counts a total of 30 legs. She already knows that this farm has only ducks and horses. Determine the number of horses from this information.""

Now, let's solve the problem. We know that ducks have 2 legs and horses have 4 legs. Let's assume the number of ducks is x and the number of horses is y. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animals is 11:
x + y = 11

2. The total number of legs is 30:
2x + 4y = 30

We can solve these equations to find the values of x and y. First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get:
2x + 2y = 22

Now, subtract this equation from the second equation:
(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 30 - 22
2y = 8

Divide by 2:
y = 4

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x:
x + y = 11
x + 4 = 11
x = 7

So, there are 7 ducks and 4 horses.

""Asha is a teacher. Asha instructs each student in her class to sketch a Roman numeral corresponding to their roll number. The student with roll number 1 will sketch the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 will sketch the second Roman numeral, and so on. Finally, Asha collects all the sketches and finds that there are 5 sketches of each Roman numeral. How many students were in the class?""

Now, let's analyze the situation. Since each Roman numeral has 5 sketches, it means that each roll number from 1 to the last Roman numeral (which is 7, representing the numerals I, V, X, L, C, D, and M) has 5 students. The last Roman numeral that can be represented by a single character is 'M' (1000 in Roman numerals), but since the problem doesn't specify any further, we will consider the first 7 unique Roman numerals that are represented by a single character: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

However, to determine the total number of students, we need to understand that the Roman numerals beyond the single-character ones (like IV, IX, etc.) will also be represented. But since we know each unique Roman numeral has 5 sketches, we can start by calculating how many unique Roman numerals there are up to a certain point.

The key piece of information is that there are 5 sketches for each Roman numeral, and since the sequence of Roman numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M, and then combinations like IV, IX, XL, etc.) is well-defined, if we list them out up to a certain number, we can find how many students there were based on the roll numbers.

However, given that each Roman numeral, regardless of its position in the sequence, has exactly 5 sketches, and considering the unique Roman numerals (both single characters and combinations), to find the total number of students, we need to find out which Roman numerals are being referred to.

But to keep it simple, since there are 7 basic Roman numerals and considering that combinations also exist, if we consider the statement that there are 5 sketches of ""each Roman numeral,"" it implies we are looking at a situation where the number of students is directly related to the number of unique Roman numerals being sketched times the number of sketches per numeral"

Now, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 15 and 25, which will give us the time interval at which both buses will leave together again.

The multiples of 15 are: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, ...
The multiples of 25 are: 25, 50, 75, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 75. Therefore, the buses will leave together again after 75 minutes.

Since they left together at 8:45 AM, we need to add 75 minutes to this time. 
75 minutes = 1 hour 15 minutes
So, adding 1 hour 15 minutes to 8:45 AM, we get:
8:45 AM + 1 hour = 9:45 AM
9:45 AM + 15 minutes = 10:00 AM

Therefore, the buses will leave together again at 10:00 AM.

""Santiago left his home country in January, staying in Australia for several months before returning on the same date in December. How many months was Santiago in Australia?""

2. Now, let's calculate the number of months Santiago stayed in Australia. 
Given that he left in January and returned in December of the same year, we can list the months he spent in Australia: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December. However, since he returned on the same date in December, it means he didn't complete the entire month of December in Australia.

Therefore, counting the months: January (1 month), February (1 month), March (1 month), April (1 month), May (1 month), June (1 month), July (1 month), August (1 month), September (1 month), October (1 month), November (1 month), and considering he was in Australia for part of December but not the entire month, we still count December as 1 month because the question asks for the number of months he stayed, not the exact days.

So, the total number of months Santiago stayed in Australia is 11 months (from January to November) plus 1 month for the partial stay in December, which equals 12 months if we count the month he departed and the month he returned, but since the question seems to be asking for the duration of his stay, excluding the month of departure and considering the return, it's more logical to understand it as the full months plus the partial month, which leads to a calculation error in the initial explanation.

Correct Calculation:
- Santiago left in January and returned in December, so he was away for the entire period from January to December, which encompasses 12 months (January to December inclusive). However, since he returned on the same date, it implies he was abroad for almost the entire year, missing only the last part of December.

The accurate way to interpret the question, based on common sense and the information provided, is that Santiago was away from his home country for nearly the entire year, from January to the same date in December. This means he spent 11 full months abroad (January to November) and a portion of December, totaling to a full year's absence from his home country except for the last few days of December in his home country.

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. The total duration of the series Hannah is watching is 3 hours, which equals 180 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
2. Hannah starts watching the series at 3:20 PM and her laptop shuts down at 5:44 PM.
3. To find out how long Hannah watched the series, we calculate the time difference between 3:20 PM and 5:44 PM.
   - From 3:20 PM to 5:44 PM is a duration of 2 hours and 24 minutes, which equals 144 minutes (since 2 hours = 120 minutes and adding 24 minutes gives 144 minutes).
4. Since the series is 180 minutes long and Hannah watched for 144 minutes, the amount of the movie she has left to watch can be found by subtracting the watched duration from the total duration:

""In a farm, there are 38 animal legs in total and 12 animals. Some are chickens and some are sheep. Determine the number of chickens.""

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of sheep as S. We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 12, so C + S = 12.
2. Chickens have 2 legs and sheep have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 38, so 2C + 4S = 38.

We can solve these equations to find the number of chickens. First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2, which gives us C + 2S = 19.

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new one to solve for S:
(C + 2S) - (C + S) = 19 - 12
S = 7

Now that we know there are 7 sheep, we can substitute S back into one of the original equations to solve for C:
C + S = 12
C + 7 = 12
C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

1. Stella's monthly income is 4919 rupees.
2. Since there are 12 months in a year, her total annual income without any leave would be 4919 * 12 = 59028 rupees.
3. However, she took a leave without pay for 2 months, which means she didn't receive her salary for those 2 months.
4. To find her actual annual income, we need to subtract the salary she didn't receive for the 2 months from her total annual income. 
5. The salary she didn't receive for the 2 months is 4919 * 2 = 9838 rupees.

Ashim's store has 50 dozen eggs. Ashim sells eggs at 120 Taka per dozen. If Prantik buys 75% of the total eggs from Ashim's store, how much will Prantik have to pay?

2. Solution:
- First, calculate the total number of eggs: 50 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen = 600 eggs.
- Then, find 75% of the total eggs: 75% of 600 eggs = 0.75 * 600 = 450 eggs.
- Since eggs are sold by the dozen, convert 450 eggs into dozens: 450 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 37.5 dozen.
- Since we cannot buy half a dozen, we will consider the calculation as it is because the price is given per dozen, and the problem doesn't specify how to handle fractions of a dozen. However, for practical purposes, we'd round to the nearest whole number or consider how the store handles such transactions.
- Calculate the cost: 37.5 dozen * 120 Taka/dozen = 4500 Taka.

Therefore, Prantik needs to pay for 37.5 dozen eggs at the rate of 120 Taka per dozen, which equals 4500 Taka.

Translation: Ava and Sara decided to play chess but found that 10 pieces were missing. How many pieces were present?

Given that a standard chess set has 32 pieces (16 for each player), we can calculate the number of pieces present by subtracting the missing pieces from the total.

Total pieces in a standard chess set = 32
Missing pieces = 10

Pieces present = Total pieces - Missing pieces = 32 - 10 = 22

1. Translation of the problem: 
Rafiq went home after buying one and a half dozen eggs from the store at 120 taka per dozen. After going home, he found 6 eggs were broken. However, how much did Rafiq spend?

2. Solution:
First, let's find out how many eggs Rafiq bought. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 1.5 dozen equals 1.5 * 12 = 18 eggs.

The cost of 1.5 dozen eggs at 120 taka per dozen is 1.5 * 120 = 180 taka.

Now, we need to consider the broken eggs. Since 6 eggs were broken, Rafiq effectively got 18 - 6 = 12 eggs.

However, the cost is determined by the number of eggs purchased, not the number of usable eggs. So, Rafiq spent 180 taka for 18 eggs, but ended up with only 12 usable eggs.

The cost per egg can be found by dividing the total cost by the total number of eggs purchased: 180 / 18 = 10 taka per egg.

But, this calculation is unnecessary for the final answer as the question only asks for the amount spent, not the cost per usable egg. Therefore, the total amount Rafiq spent is the cost of 1.5 dozen eggs.

Now, let's break it down:
- The temperature increases by 3 units every century (100 years).
- We need to find the change in temperature over 700 years.

Since there are 100 years in a century, 700 years is equivalent to 700 / 100 = 7 centuries.

Given that the temperature increases by 3 units every century, over 7 centuries, the total increase would be 7 * 3 = 21 units.

Therefore, the change in temperature in 700 years would be an increase of 21 units.

1. Translation of the problem: Victoria moves at a speed of 95 meters per second. How many kilometers can she cover in 2 minutes?

2. Convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour:
Speed = 95 meters/second
To convert meters/second into kilometers/hour, we multiply by 3.6 (since 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h):
Speed = 95 * 3.6 = 342 km/h

3. Convert 2 minutes into hours since the speed is now in kilometers per hour:
2 minutes = 2/60 = 1/30 hours

4. Calculate the distance covered in 2 minutes:

1. Translation of the problem:
The problem states that there are 60 animal legs and a total of 20 animals on a farm. It mentions that some are chickens and some are sheep. We need to find the number of sheep.

2. Solution:
We know that chickens have 2 legs and sheep have 4 legs. We can set up two equations based on the information given:
- The total number of animals: C + S = 20
- The total number of legs: 2C + 4S = 60

From the first equation, we can express C in terms of S: C = 20 - S

Substituting C in the second equation: 2(20 - S) + 4S = 60
Expanding the equation: 40 - 2S + 4S = 60
Combining like terms: 2S = 20
Dividing both sides by 2: S = 10

Therefore, the number of sheep is 10.

Now, let's solve it step by step:

1. Convert both times into just minutes for easier calculation:

2. Add these two amounts of time together:
   - 205 minutes + 515 minutes = 720 minutes

3. Convert the total minutes back into hours and minutes:

1. Translation of the problem:
Rafiq bought half a dozen eggs from a shop at a rate of 144 taka per dozen and went home. After getting home, he found 3 eggs were damaged. However, how much money did Rafiq lose?

2. Solution:
First, we need to find the cost of half a dozen eggs. Since the price is given per dozen, we divide the price by 2 to get the cost of half a dozen eggs.
Cost per dozen eggs = 144 taka
Cost of half a dozen eggs = 144 / 2 = 72 taka

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, half a dozen contains 6 eggs.
Rafiq found 3 eggs damaged out of 6.

The cost of each egg can be calculated by dividing the cost of half a dozen eggs by the number of eggs in half a dozen.
Cost per egg = Cost of half a dozen eggs / Number of eggs in half a dozen
Cost per egg = 72 / 6 = 12 taka

Now, we calculate the total loss incurred by Rafiq due to the damaged eggs.
Number of damaged eggs = 3
Loss = Number of damaged eggs * Cost per egg
Loss = 3 * 12 = 36 taka

Therefore, Rafiq incurred a loss of 36 taka.

Since cows have 4 legs, we can assume other animals like chickens have 2 legs, but without specific information about other types of animals, we'll consider a general approach where cows are the main focus.

However, to proceed with the information given and find a straightforward solution, we must make an assumption. If we assume the farm only contains cows (since no information is provided about other animals), we can calculate the number of cows as follows:

Total legs = 460  
 Legs per cow = 4  

Number of cows = Total legs / Legs per cow

- Price of the pencil: 6 taka * 100 poisha/taka = 600 poisha
- Elizabeth's money: 5 taka * 100 poisha/taka = 500 poisha
- Borrowed money: 53 poisha

Total money Elizabeth has now = 500 poisha + 53 poisha = 553 poisha

To find out how much more money Elizabeth needs to buy the pencil:

""Iqueal has painted all the outer faces of 5 identical cube-shaped objects. How many faces has Iqueal painted in total?""

Since each cube has 6 faces, and there are 5 cubes, we might initially think to calculate the total number of faces as 5 cubes * 6 faces per cube = 30 faces. However, this counts all the faces, including those that are not outer faces when the cubes are considered together.

But, since the problem specifies ""outer faces"" and does not indicate any specific arrangement of the cubes that would cause inner faces to be painted (such as stacking or attaching them in a way that some faces are obscured), we can assume each cube is treated individually. 

Therefore, if Iqueal painted all the outer faces of 5 identical cubes, and each cube has 6 faces, then the total number of faces painted is indeed 5 cubes * 6 faces per cube = 30 faces.

Translation: Josephine starts saving ten paise every day. How many days will it take for her to save a total of 2 rupees?

Now, let's solve the problem. We know that 1 rupee equals 100 paise. Therefore, 2 rupees equal 200 paise. Since Josephine saves 10 paise every day, we can calculate the number of days it will take for her to save 200 paise by dividing the total amount by the daily savings.

Daily savings: 10 paise
Total savings needed: 200 paise

Number of days = Total savings needed / Daily savings
= 200 paise / 10 paise
= 20 days

Therefore, it will take Josephine 20 days to save a total of 2 rupees.

""The hiking team needs to arrange gloves for each participant. If the total number of participants is 63, what is the minimum number of gloves the hiking team needs to arrange?""

Since each participant needs a pair of gloves (one for each hand), the minimum number of gloves required would be twice the number of participants.

Minimum number of gloves = 2 * Total number of participants
Minimum number of gloves = 2 * 63
Minimum number of gloves = 126

Therefore, the hiking team needs to arrange at least 126 gloves for the participants.

1. Translation of the problem:
Ariana lost 3 pieces and Samantha lost 9 pieces in a game of chess. How many pieces are left on the chessboard?

2. Solution:
In a standard chess game, each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns. Therefore, at the beginning of the game, there are 32 pieces on the board (16 pieces for each player).

Ariana lost 3 pieces, and Samantha lost 9 pieces, making a total of 3 + 9 = 12 pieces lost.

To find the number of pieces left on the chessboard, we subtract the total number of lost pieces from the initial total:
32 (initial pieces) - 12 (lost pieces) = 20

Therefore, there are 20 pieces left on the chessboard.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
The problem states that Sofia starts saving ten paise every day. We need to find out how many days it takes for her to save a total of 2 rupees.

2. Now, let's proceed with the calculation:
First, we need to convert the amount from rupees to paise because Sofia saves in paise. We know that 1 rupee = 100 paise.
So, 2 rupees = 2 * 100 = 200 paise.

Since Sofia saves 10 paise per day, we can calculate the number of days required for her to save 200 paise by dividing the total amount (200 paise) by the daily savings (10 paise).

Number of days = Total savings / Daily savings
= 200 paise / 10 paise
= 20 days

Therefore, it takes Sofia 20 days to save a total of 2 rupees.

The problem in English translates to: 
""Ava decides to visit a nearby farm where there are a total of 9 animals. She stands in a row at the entrance, from the gate she can see the legs of the farm animals and she counts a total of 26 legs. She already knows that this farm has only chickens and buffalo. Determine the number of buffalo from this information.""

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of buffalo as B. 

Given information:
1. Total number of animals = 9
   This can be written as: C + B = 9

2. Total number of legs = 26
   Since chickens have 2 legs and buffalo have 4 legs, this can be written as: 2C + 4B = 26

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. C + B = 9
2. 2C + 4B = 26

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of B (number of buffalo).

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
C + 2B = 13

Now, we subtract the first equation from this new equation:
(C + 2B) - (C + B) = 13 - 9
This simplifies to:
B = 4

Therefore, the number of buffalo is 4.

""A teacher divided 40 male students and 24 female students into several groups so that each group has an equal number of male and female students, and no student is left over. Determine the maximum number of groups that can be formed and the number of male and female students in each group.""

To find the maximum number of groups where each group has an equal number of male and female students, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of male students (40) and the number of female students (24). 

The factors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.
The factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40 and 24 is 8. This means that each group can have 8 students in total, with 4 male students and 4 female students, since 8 is the largest number that divides both 40 and 24 without leaving a remainder.

To find the maximum number of groups, we divide the total number of male students by the number of male students per group, and the total number of female students by the number of female students per group:

Maximum number of groups based on male students = 40 / 4 = 10
Maximum number of groups based on female students = 24 / 4 = 6

Since both calculations must result in a whole number (as you cannot have a fraction of a group), and we are looking for the maximum number of groups where both conditions (equal number of males and females in each group and no students left over) are met, we see that the limiting factor is the number of female students, allowing for 6 groups.

Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can be formed is 6, with each group having 4 male students and 4 female students.

Translation: A square park has been fenced, and the total cost of the fence was 172 rupees. What is the cost of fencing per side?

Since the park is square, all sides are equal in length. Let's denote the cost of fencing per side as 'x'. The total cost of fencing the park would be the sum of the costs of fencing all four sides, which is 4x.

Given that the total cost of fencing is 172 rupees, we can set up the equation:
4x = 172

To find the cost of fencing per side (x), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 172 / 4
x = 43

Therefore, the cost of fencing per side is 43 rupees.
