Harper decides to visit a nearby animal farm where there are a total of 11 animals. She is standing in line near the entrance and from the gate, she counted a total of 30 legs of the farm animals. She already knows that this farm only has ducks and horses. From this information, determine the number of ducks.

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

1. Let's denote:
   - \( d \) = number of ducks
   - \( h \) = number of horses

2. We know from the problem:
   - The total number of animals (ducks + horses) is 11:
     \[
     d + h = 11
     \]

3. We also know the total number of legs counted is 30. Ducks have 2 legs each and horses have 4 legs each. So, the equation for total legs is:
   \[
   2d + 4h = 30
   \]

### Solving the equations:
Let's first solve the system of equations above.

From equation 1, express \( h \) in terms of \( d \):
\[
h = 11 - d
\]

Substitute this expression for \( h \) in equation 2:
\[
2d + 4(11 - d) = 30
\]

Expand and simplify the equation:
\[
2d + 44 - 4d = 30
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
-2d + 44 = 30
\]

Subtract 44 from both sides:
\[
-2d = 30 - 44
\]

\[
-2d = -14
\]

Divide by -2:
\[
d = 7
\]

Therefore, the number of ducks is 7.

To verify, calculate the number of horses:
Since \( h = 11 - d \), then:
\[
h = 11 - 7 = 4
\]

Check the total legs:
- Ducks have 7 × 2 = 14 legs
- Horses have 4 × 4 = 16 legs

Total legs = 14 + 16 = 30, which matches the problem statement.

**English Translation:** On a farm, there are 38 animal legs and a total of 12 animals. Some are chickens and some are sheep. Determine the number of chickens.

## Step 2: Understand the Problem
We need to find out how many chickens are on the farm, given the following:
- Total number of animals: 12
- Total number of legs: 38
- Each chicken has 2 legs.
- Each sheep has 4 legs.

Let:
- \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- \( s \) be the number of sheep.

We have the following system of equations based on the problem:
1. \( c + s = 12 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2c + 4s = 38 \) (total number of legs)

## Step 3: Solve the Equations

**Equation 1:**  
\[ c + s = 12 \]

**Equation 2:**  
\[ 2c + 4s = 38 \]

### Step 3.1: Simplify Equation 2
Divide the entire equation by 2 to make it simpler:
\[ c + 2s = 19 \]

### Step 3.2: Solve the System of Equations
Subtract Equation 1 from the simplified Equation 2:
\[ (c + 2s) - (c + s) = 19 - 12 \]

\[ c + 2s - c - s = 7 \]

\[ s = 7 \]

Now substitute \( s = 7 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ c + 7 = 12 \]

\[ c = 12 - 7 \]

\[ c = 5 \]

## Conclusion
The number of chickens on the farm is 5.

  - Highest power of 3: 3¹
  - Highest power of 5: 5¹

  LCM = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹ = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60

### Step 2: Calculate Time
The LCM of 12 and 5 is 60. This indicates that the next time the two bells will ring together is 60 minutes, or 1 hour, after 3 PM.

### Step 3: Conclude the Time
Since both bells ring together at 3 PM, they will next ring together 1 hour later.

- 3 PM + 1 hour = 4 PM

Therefore, the next time both bells will ring together after starting at 3 PM is 4 PM.

**Answer: 4 PM**"

Karim is an 18-year-old boy. He does not have an index finger on one of his hands. How many total fingers does he have on both hands?

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Background Information**:
   - Normally, a person has 5 fingers on each hand.
   - Therefore, a person with both hands intact and without any finger loss has \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fingers in total.

2. **Situation Analysis**:
   - Karim is missing one index finger on one of his hands. 
   - This means, on one hand, instead of having 5 fingers, Karim has \( 5 - 1 = 4 \) fingers.

3. **Count the Fingers**:
   - Fingers on the hand with the missing index finger: 4 fingers.
   - Fingers on the other hand: 5 fingers (assuming it is a normal hand with no fingers missing).

4. **Calculate the Total Fingers**:
   \[
   \text{Total fingers} = 4 (\text{fingers on one hand}) + 5 (\text{fingers on the other hand}) = 9
   \]

Therefore, Karim has a total of 9 fingers.

A machine is cutting branches and processing apples. If I see 204 branches after 6 hours, how many apples have been processed?

## Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, let's make some logical assumptions and follow the steps:

1. **Identify Variables and Operations**:
    - Let's assume the machine cuts branches and processes apples simultaneously.
    - Let \( x \) be the number of branches cut per hour.
    - Let \( y \) be the number of apples processed per hour.

2. **Initial Information**:
    - After 6 hours, the machine has cut 204 branches. This gives us the equation for branches:
      \[
      6x = 204
      \]

3. **Solving for Branches Per Hour**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 6:
     \[
     x = \frac{204}{6} = 34
     \]
   - The machine cuts 34 branches per hour.

4. **Finding Total Apples Processed**:
    - Given that we have not been directly provided the number of apples processed or a way to calculate it from the number of branches cut, we need additional assumptions or data that presumably would relate the two operations. However, based on the typical structure of such problems, if the question is really purely relating to apples processed, another piece of information or assumption linking branches cut to apples processed would be needed in a realistic scenario.
   
5. **Conclusion Based on Information**:
    - However, given the information and structure you provided, it seems like converting branch cutting information directly to the number of apples processed is not feasible without additional data.
    
6. **Answer**:
   - As no further relationships or data have been specified to determine the correlation between branches and apples, based on the provided problem statement, we conclude that there is insufficient information to calculate the number of apples processed. The problem statement might be incomplete or relying on additional context.

Therefore, without an explicit connection between branch cutting and apple processing, no specific numerical answer is feasible. However, assuming they intended for every branch processed an equal and existing problem context, without further clarification from the problem, the answer for designated processed apples will remain undefined directly in this articulation."

   - Hearts and diamonds are red suits, whereas clubs and spades are black suits.
   - Therefore, each red suit (hearts or diamonds) contains 13 cards.
   - Together, the two red suits (hearts and diamonds) contain \(13 + 13 = 26\) red cards.

2. **Total Number of Red Cards in Nine Decks:**
   - Since one deck has 26 red cards, for nine decks, you simply multiply the number of red cards per deck by the number of decks.
   - Calculation: \(26 \text{ red cards/deck} \times 9 \text{ decks} = 234\) red cards.

Therefore, the shopkeeper has a total of 234 red-colored cards.

Today, I will go on a trip to Puri with all my family members. The train will depart from Howrah Station at 22:35. However, we have already reached Howrah Station at 20:35. Calculate how many hours we have to wait at the station.

## Solution:

To find out how long we have to wait at the station, we need to calculate the time difference between when we arrived at the station and when the train departs.

1. **Arrival Time:** 20:35
2. **Departure Time:** 22:35

We calculate the time difference between these two:

- The minutes part is the same for both the arrival and departure times (35 minutes), so no need to worry about carrying over minutes.
- We simply subtract the hours part:

   \[
   22 - 20 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the family has to wait **2 hours** at the station before the train departs.

**Conclusion:**

By calculating the difference between our arrival time and the departure time of the train, we can conclude that the wait time at the station is two hours.

""Wayne, a doctor, went to the operating theater at 3:28 PM to perform a surgery that lasted 3 hours. Wayne’s sister came to visit him at 5:36 PM. How many minutes did she have to wait to meet Wayne?""

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Wayne started the operation at 3:28 PM.
   - The operation lasted for 3 hours.
   - Wayne's sister arrived at 5:36 PM.
   - We need to calculate the waiting time of Wayne's sister until the operation is completed.

2. **Calculate the End Time of the Operation:**
   - Start Time of Operation = 3:28 PM
   - Duration of Operation = 3 hours
   - Therefore, the operation ended at:
     \[
     \text{3:28 PM} + 3 \text{ hours} = \text{6:28 PM}
     \]

3. **Find the Waiting Time:**
   - Wayne's sister arrived at 5:36 PM
   - The operation concluded at 6:28 PM
   - To find the waiting time, we calculate the difference between 6:28 PM and 5:36 PM.
   - Time difference calculation:
     - From 5:36 PM to 6:00 PM = 24 minutes
     - From 6:00 PM to 6:28 PM = 28 minutes

4. **Total Waiting Time:**
   - Add the two parts of waiting time:
     \[
     24 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} = 52 \text{ minutes}

In a farm, there are 48 animal legs and a total of 15 animals. There are some ducks and some horses. Determine the number of horses.

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( h \) represent the number of horses.
   - Let \( d \) represent the number of ducks.

2. **Formulate the Equations:**
   - We know that the total number of animals is 15. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     h + d = 15
     \]

   - Horses have 4 legs and ducks have 2 legs. Given that there are 48 legs in total, we can write the equation:
     \[
     4h + 2d = 48
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   h + d = 15 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]
   \[
   4h + 2d = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

   Let's solve these equations step by step:

   - First, simplify Equation 2 by dividing every term by 2:
     \[
     2h + d = 24
     \]

   - Now, we have:

     **Equation 1:** \( h + d = 15 \)

     **Equation 3 (simplified Equation 2):** \( 2h + d = 24 \)

   - Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3 to eliminate \( d \):
     \[
     (2h + d) - (h + d) = 24 - 15
     \]
     \[
     2h + d - h - d = 9
     \]
     \[
     h = 9
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Ducks:**

   Substitute \( h = 9 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   9 + d = 15
   \]
   \[
   d = 6
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   We have determined the number of horses and ducks. According to our calculations, there are 9 horses and 6 ducks. Thus, the number of horses is **9**"

The problem in Bengali can be translated into English as follows:

""Nevah travels at a speed of 70 meters per second. How many kilometers can she cover in 3 minutes?""

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Nevah can cover at the given speed and time. Let's follow these steps:

1. **Convert Time to Seconds:**
   - Nevah is traveling for 3 minutes. 
   - Since 1 minute equals 60 seconds, 3 minutes equals \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Distance in Meters:**
   - Distance can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Here, speed = 70 meters/second, and time = 180 seconds.
   - Therefore, 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{meters/second} \times 180 \, \text{seconds} = 12600 \, \text{meters}
     \]

3. **Convert Distance from Meters to Kilometers:**
   - We know that 1 kilometer = 1000 meters.
   - So, to convert 12600 meters to kilometers:
     \[
     \text{Distance in kilometers} = \frac{12600 \, \text{meters}}{1000} = 12.6 \, \text{kilometers}
     \]

Therefore, Nevah can cover 12.6 kilometers in 3 minutes at a speed of 70 meters per second.

   There is a 31-hour train journey from the east coast to the west coast. If the train starts its journey from the east coast early on Monday, on what day will it reach its destination?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we need to calculate the day of arrival, given a 31-hour train journey starting early on Monday.

   - The train starts on Monday at an unspecified early hour. For simplicity, let's assume the train starts at 12:00 AM on Monday, which marks the very start of the day.
   - We need to add 31 hours to this initial time to find out when the train will arrive.

   Let's break this down:
   
   - From 12:00 AM Monday to 11:59 PM Monday, there are 24 hours.
   - Adding these 24 hours, the time would be 12:00 AM on Tuesday.
   - Now, 31 hours - 24 hours = 7 remaining hours need to be added to 12:00 AM on Tuesday.

   - By adding these 7 hours to 12:00 AM on Tuesday, we get:

     \[
     \text{12:00 AM Tuesday} + 7 \text{ hours} = 7:00 AM Tuesday
     \]

   Therefore, the train, which starts its journey early Monday morning, will arrive at 7:00 AM on Tuesday.

In a factory, 2450 motorcycles are produced in 5 days. How many motorcycles will be produced in 5 weeks in that factory?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate of motorcycle production per day, and then calculate the total number of motorcycles produced over 5 weeks.

### Step 1: Determine the daily production rate

- Total motorcycles produced in 5 days = 2450.
- Therefore, the daily production rate is calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{Daily Production} = \frac{2450}{5} = 490
  \]

This means the factory produces 490 motorcycles per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total production for 5 weeks

A week has 7 days. Thus, 5 weeks will have:

\[
5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ days}
\]

Next, calculate the total number of motorcycles produced in 35 days using the daily production rate:

\[
\text{Total Production in 5 weeks} = 490 \times 35
\]

To calculate this, we perform the multiplication:

1. First, multiply:

   \[
   490 \times 35 = 490 \times (30 + 5) = 490 \times 30 + 490 \times 5
   \]

2. Calculate each term:

   - \( 490 \times 30 = 14700 \)
   - \( 490 \times 5 = 2450 \)

3. Add these products together:

   \[
   14700 + 2450 = 17150
   \]

Thus, the factory will produce 17,150 motorcycles in 5 weeks.

   - A dozen means 12 units, so half a dozen is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) eggs.

2. **Calculating the Cost Per Egg:**
   - The cost given is 14 Taka per egg.

3. **Calculating the Total Cost for Half a Dozen Eggs:**

Leonardo wants to buy a chocolate. The price of the chocolate is 5 taka and Leonardo has only 4 taka in his pocket. He borrowed 59 paise from his friend. How much more paise does Leonardo need to buy a chocolate?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert Prices into Paise:**

   - We know that 1 taka equals 100 paise.

   - Therefore, the price of the chocolate (5 taka) in paise is:
     \[
     5 \times 100 = 500 \text{ paise}
     \]

   - Similarly, the amount Leonardo has in his pocket (4 taka) in paise is:
     \[
     4 \times 100 = 400 \text{ paise}
     \]

2. **Calculate Total Amount Leonardo Currently Has:**

   - Leonardo borrowed an additional 59 paise from his friend. Thus, his total amount in paise becomes:
     \[
     400 \text{ paise} (from his pocket) + 59 \text{ paise} = 459 \text{ paise}
     \]

3. **Determine Additional Amount Needed:**

   - The total price of the chocolate is 500 paise.
   - The amount Leonardo has is 459 paise.

   - The additional paise required by Leonardo is:
     \[
     500 \text{ paise} - 459 \text{ paise} = 41 \text{ paise}
     \]

## Conclusion:

Leonardo needs an additional 41 paise to buy the chocolate.

Rafik went to a shop and bought 2.5 dozen eggs at a rate of 144 taka per dozen. After reaching home, he found that 4 eggs were spoiled. How much did Rafik spend?

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Determine the cost per single egg:**  
   Rafik bought the eggs at a rate of 144 taka per dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the cost per egg can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost per egg} = \frac{144 \text{ taka}}{12} = 12 \text{ taka}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs purchased:**  
   Rafik purchased 2.5 dozen eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of eggs bought is:
   \[
   2.5 \times 12 = 30 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 2.5 dozen eggs:**  
   Since we know the cost per dozen is 144 taka, the total cost for 2.5 dozen is:
   \[
   2.5 \times 144 = 360 \text{ taka}
   \]

4. **Analyze the impact of the spoiled eggs:**  
   Although Rafik found 4 eggs were spoiled, the problem only asks for the total amount spent, not how many usable eggs there were. Thus, the fact that some eggs were spoiled does not affect the calculation of the initial cost.

5. **Confirming the spending calculation:**  
   Rafik's total spending was the purchase cost for 2.5 dozen eggs at the given price per dozen. The spoilage of the eggs is irrelevant to the calculation of this spending.

Thus, the total amount spent by Rafik is **360 taka**.

The biology teacher noticed that Caleb is not paying attention in class and asked him to report the number of insects in the lab if there is a total of 42 insect legs. What should Caleb's answer be?

### Solution:

To solve the problem, we first need to understand that insects typically have 6 legs each. Our objective is to determine how many such insects would collectively have 42 legs.

1. **Define the number of insects as a variable**:
   \[
   \text{Let } x \text{ be the number of insects.}
   \]

2. **Express the total number of legs**:
   Since each insect has 6 legs, the total legs for \( x \) insects is:
   \[
   6x
   \]

3. **Set up an equation**:
   According to the problem, the total number of legs is given as 42. This leads to the equation:
   \[
   6x = 42
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 6:
   \[
   x = \frac{42}{6}
   \]
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

5. **Verification**:
   To verify, calculate the total legs for 7 insects:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42
   \]
   The calculation confirms that 7 insects indeed have 42 legs in total.

Thus, the number of insects Caleb should report is 7.

After being fully charged at 4:12 PM, Kader begins watching a 7-hour series. Kader continues watching movies until his laptop's battery is completely drained at 10:43 PM. How many minutes of movies does Kader have left to watch?

### Detailed Solution:

1. **Convert Time to a 24-hour Format for Clarity:**
   - The laptop starts at 4:12 PM, which is 16:12 in a 24-hour format.
   - The laptop battery is completely drained by 10:43 PM, which is 22:43 in a 24-hour format.

2. **Calculate Total Time Watched Till Battery Died:**
   - Start time: 16:12
   - End time: 22:43

   To find the duration:
   - From 16:12 to 22:12 is exactly 6 hours (since 22:12 minus 16:12 results in 6:00).
   - Add additional 31 minutes from 22:12 to 22:43.

   Total time watched = 6 hours + 31 minutes = 6 hours and 31 minutes.

3. **Determine the Total Movie Duration of the Series:**
   - The series is a total of 7 hours long.

4. **Calculate Remaining Movie Time:**
   - Total series time is 7 hours = 7 hours and 0 minutes.
   - Kader watched 6 hours and 31 minutes before the laptop battery died.

   Remaining time = (7 hours 0 minutes) - (6 hours 31 minutes)  
   
   Break it down:
   - Subtract minutes: 0 mins - 31 mins = -31 mins, so need to borrow 1 hour (60 mins)
   - New subtraction: 60 mins - 31 mins = 29 mins remaining

   Hence, after borrowing 1 hour:
   - Subtract hours: 7 hours - 1 hour (borrowed) = 6 hours
   - Remaining hours: 6 hours - 6 hours = 0 hours

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Remaining movie time: 0 hours and 29 minutes

Thus, Kader has 29 minutes of the series left to watch.

A factory produces 2,450 motorcycles in 5 days. How many motorcycles will be produced in 4 weeks in that factory?

## Detailed Solution:
To find out how many motorcycles are produced in 4 weeks, we first need to determine the production rate of motorcycles per day and then calculate the total production over 4 weeks.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily production of motorcycles.
We know that the factory produces 2,450 motorcycles in 5 days. Thus, the production rate in motorcycles per day is calculated by dividing the total production (2,450 motorcycles) by the number of days (5 days).

\[
\text{Daily production rate} = \frac{2450 \text{ motorcycles}}{5 \text{ days}} = 490 \text{ motorcycles per day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total production in 4 weeks.
There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days. 

Using the daily production rate, we can calculate the total production over these 28 days (4 weeks):

\[
\text{Total production over 28 days} = 490 \text{ motorcycles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 13,720 \text{ motorcycles}
\]

Therefore, the total number of motorcycles produced in 4 weeks is 13,720.

   Anna works every day and receives a weekly salary of 1379 Taka. If Anna does not go to work for 2 days this week, find out how much salary will be deducted.

2. **Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we need to determine how much salary Anna earns per day and then calculate the deduction for the two days she did not work.

   - **Step 1: Calculate the daily salary.**

     Anna's weekly salary is 1379 Taka, and assuming she works every day of the week, she works 7 days. Therefore, her daily salary can be calculated by dividing the weekly salary by the number of days she works in a week.

     \[
     \text{Daily salary} = \frac{\text{Weekly salary}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{1379 \text{ Taka}}{7}
     \]

     Carrying out the division:

     \[
     \frac{1379}{7} = 197
     \]

     Therefore, Anna's daily salary is 197 Taka.

   - **Step 2: Calculate the deduction for 2 days.**

     Now we need to determine the amount to deduct for the 2 days Anna did not work. Since her daily earning is 197 Taka, the deduction for 2 days is:

     \[
     \text{Deduction for 2 days} = 2 \times \text{Daily salary} = 2 \times 197 = 394 \text{ Taka}
     \]

     Therefore, the deduction from Anna's salary for not working 2 days is 394 Taka.

The given problem in Bengali translates to English as follows:

""Asif's farm animals have a total of 460 legs. How many cows are there on his farm?""

### Step 2: Assumptions and Mathematical Setup

1. **Assumption**: We will assume that the farm has only cows and chickens. This is because typically on a farm, these are among the most common animals and help create a scenario for solving the problem. Cows have 4 legs, while chickens have 2 legs.

2. **Variables**:
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of cows on Asif's farm.
   - Let \( n \) represent other farm animals that we may need to consider. However, in this setup, we temporarily ignore the count of others assuming that chickens could be the only other animals present for initial scenario simplification.

### Step 3: Mathematical Equation

Based on the assumption:
- Cows contribute \( 4c \) legs.

Given that the total number of legs on the farm is 460, and since we're focused here initially on cows alone without specific other animal counts, our initial question guided directly:
\[ 4c = 460 \]

### Step 4: Solving the Equation

Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = \frac{460}{4} \]
\[ c = 115 \]

### Step 5: Verification and Conclusion
1. Since we're considering only cows initially, these would be validated if the cow count individually satisfies the total leg count.
2. If there are indeed no other significant animals, then Asif has 115 cows, as this satisfies the condition of 460 legs: \( 4 \times 115 = 460 \).

Hence, the total number of cows Asif has, assuming only these contribute, validly matches the given scenario.

In a parking lot, Grayson noticed that there are 48 car wheels. How many cars are there in the parking lot?

### 2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars are in the parking lot given the total number of wheels.

Step 1: **Recognize that each car typically has 4 wheels.**

For standard vehicles, the assumption is that each car has 4 wheels. This helps us to calculate the number of cars if we know the total number of wheels.

Step 2: **Calculate the number of cars based on the total number of wheels.**

Given that there are 48 wheels, and knowing that each car has 4 wheels, we can set up the following equation to solve for the number of cars (\( n \)):

\[
4 \times n = 48
\]

Step 3: **Solve for \( n \).**

To find \( n \), which represents the number of cars, divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
n = \frac{48}{4} = 12
\]

This calculation reveals that the number of cars in the parking lot is 12.

Rafiq bought half a dozen eggs at the rate of 132 Taka per dozen from the shop and went home. At home, he found that 2 eggs were spoiled. How much money did Rafiq spend?

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Determine the cost per egg.**

   First, we need to find out the price of one egg. We know that one dozen (which is 12 eggs) costs 132 Taka.

   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 egg} = \frac{132 \text{ Taka}}{12 \text{ eggs}} = 11 \text{ Taka per egg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for half a dozen eggs.**

   A half dozen means 6 eggs. So we need to calculate how much 6 eggs will cost at the rate of 11 Taka per egg.

   \[
   \text{Cost for 6 eggs} = 6 \text{ eggs} \times 11 \text{ Taka/egg} = 66 \text{ Taka}
   \]

3. **Consider the spoiled eggs.**

   Although 2 eggs were spoiled, the problem only asks how much money Rafiq spent, not the cost per usable egg. Thus, the spoiled eggs don't affect the total amount spent, only the utility.

4. **Conclude with the total amount spent.**

   Rafiq spent a total of 66 Taka for the 6 eggs he bought.

In a farm, there are 42 animal legs and a total of 15 animals. Some are ducks and some are cows. Determine the number of cows.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve the problem, we need to define some variables and set up equations based on the information provided:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the number of ducks.
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Each duck has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs from ducks is \( 2d \).
   - Each cow has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs from cows is \( 4c \).
   - We know there are a total of 15 animals. Thus, the equation is:
     \[
     d + c = 15
     \]
   - We know the total number of legs is 42. Thus, the equation is:
     \[
     2d + 4c = 42
     \]

3. **Solve the Equations:**

   First, solve the first equation for \( d \):
   \[
   d = 15 - c
   \]

   Substitute \( d = 15 - c \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2(15 - c) + 4c = 42
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( c \):
   \[
   30 - 2c + 4c = 42
   \]
   \[
   2c + 30 = 42
   \]
   \[
   2c = 42 - 30
   \]
   \[
   2c = 12
   \]
   \[
   c = 6

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Time Format**: 
   - The time is given in a 12-hour format. 
   - 4 AM corresponds to 4 in the morning.
   - 8 PM corresponds to 8 in the evening.

2. **Calculate the Duration of the Journey**:
   - First, convert these times to a 24-hour format for easier calculation:
     - 4 AM remains 4:00 hours.
     - 8 PM converts to 20:00 hours (since 8 + 12 = 20).
   
3. **Perform the Subtraction to Find the Journey Duration**:
   - Subtract the starting time from the ending time using 24-hour clock arithmetic:
     - Starting time in 24-hour format: 4:00
     - Ending time in 24-hour format: 20:00
     - Duration = Ending time - Starting time = 20:00 - 4:00
   
4. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - Subtraction gives us:
     - 20:00 - 4:00 = 16:00
   
5. **Convert the Duration into Hours and Minutes**:

   However, since the price given is per dozen and we need to calculate the costs for dozens, we just interpret 6.5 as direct dozens.

2. **Calculating Total Cost:**
   - Since the price is given as 10 Tk per dozen, Jamal buys 6.5 dozens. We calculate the total cost as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 6.5 \text{ dozens} \times 10 \text{ Tk/dozen} = 65 \text{ Tk}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The total amount of money Jamal spent on the eggs is 65 Tk.

Four black cards have been removed from a deck of cards. What is the number of remaining black cards?

## Detailed Solution:
Let's understand the composition of a standard deck of cards to answer this question. A standard deck consists of 52 cards, which are divided as follows:

1. **Suits**: There are 4 suits, each with 13 cards:
   - Spades (black)
   - Clubs (black)
   - Hearts (red)
   - Diamonds (red)

2. **Colors and Distribution**:
   - Black cards: Comprise Spades and Clubs.
   - Red cards: Comprise Hearts and Diamonds.

In total, there are:
- 26 black cards (13 Spades + 13 Clubs)
- 26 red cards (13 Hearts + 13 Diamonds)

Given in the problem, 4 black cards have been removed from the deck.

To find the number of black cards remaining, we simply subtract the number of black cards removed from the initial number of black cards:

\[
\text{Remaining Black Cards} = \text{Total Black Cards} - \text{Removed Black Cards}
\]
\[
= 26 - 4
\]
\[
= 22
\]

Therefore, the number of remaining black cards is 22.

   Tahsan went to the store and bought one and a half dozen eggs at 120 taka per dozen. Upon reaching home, he found that 5 of the eggs were spoiled. How much financial loss did Tahsan incur?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   - **Step 1:** Determine the total number of eggs Tahsan bought.
   
     Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, one and a half dozen is calculated as:
     \[
     1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ eggs}
     \]

   - **Step 2:** Calculate the total cost for 1.5 dozen eggs.
   
     The cost per dozen is 120 taka, so for 1.5 dozen:
     \[
     1.5 \times 120 = 180 \text{ taka}
     \]

   - **Step 3:** Find the cost per individual egg.
   
     Since 18 eggs cost 180 taka, the cost per egg is:
     \[
     \frac{180}{18} = 10 \text{ taka}
     \]

   - **Step 4:** Determine the total number of spoiled eggs and their total cost.
   
     Tahsan found 5 eggs spoiled. The cost of these 5 spoiled eggs at 10 taka each is:
     \[
     5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ taka}
     \]

What is the result of (3 hours 13 minutes) - (2 hours 12 minutes) in minutes?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert the Time into Total Minutes:**

   - First, convert both time periods into total minutes to simplify the subtraction.

   - For 3 hours 13 minutes:
     - 1 hour = 60 minutes
     - So, 3 hours will be \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.
     - Add the additional 13 minutes: \(180 + 13 = 193\) minutes.

   - For 2 hours 12 minutes:
     - 2 hours will be \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
     - Add the additional 12 minutes: \(120 + 12 = 132\) minutes.

2. **Perform the Subtraction:**

   - Now subtract the total minutes of the second time period from the total minutes of the first time period:
   - \(193\) minutes (from 3 hours 13 minutes) - \(132\) minutes (from 2 hours 12 minutes) = \(61\) minutes.

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance that Jason can cover in a given time using the formula for distance in uniform motion:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

### Step 1: Use the given speed and time

- Speed = 460 meters/second
- Time = 38 seconds

Using the formula, we calculate the distance in meters:

\[ \text{Distance in meters} = 17,480 \, \text{meters} \]

### Step 2: Convert meters to kilometers

Since 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters, we need to divide the distance in meters by 1,000 to convert it to kilometers:

\[ \text{Distance in kilometers} = \frac{17,480}{1,000} \]

\[ \text{Distance in kilometers} = 17.48 \, \text{km} \]

Isaac wakes up every day at 7 AM and goes to sleep at 11 PM. How many hours does Isaac sleep in a day?

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of hours Isaac is awake, not asleep. Since he wakes up at 7 AM and goes to sleep at 11 PM, we'll first calculate the total hours he spends awake.

1. **Identify the start and end times of Isaac's waking hours:**
   - Start: 7 AM
   - End: 11 PM

2. **Convert the time format to a 24-hour time format for easier calculation:**
   - 7 AM in 24-hour format is 07:00.
   - 11 PM in 24-hour format is 23:00.

3. **Calculate the total waking hours:**
   - From 07:00 to 23:00 is a straightforward calculation: 
   \[
   23 - 7 = 16 \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, Isaac is awake for 16 hours a day.

4. **Calculate the sleeping hours:**
   - Since a day consists of 24 hours, we can find the number of hours he sleeps by subtracting his waking hours from the total hours in a day:
   \[
   24 - 16 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, Isaac sleeps for 8 hours a day.

In a farm, there are 60 animal legs and a total of 20 animals. Some are chickens and some are sheep. Find the number of sheep.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sheep are on the farm, knowing there are a total of 20 animals and 60 legs. Chickens have 2 legs, and sheep have 4 legs. 

Let's use the following variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( s \) be the number of sheep.

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:

1. The total number of animals (chickens and sheep) is 20:
   \[
   c + s = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 60:
   \[
   2c + 4s = 60
   \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, simplify the second equation by dividing through by 2:
\[
c + 2s = 30
\]

Now we have the simplified system of equations:
1. \( c + s = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2s = 30 \)

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:
\[
(c + 2s) - (c + s) = 30 - 20
\]
\[
c + 2s - c - s = 10
\]
\[
s = 10
\]

Substitute \( s = 10 \) back into equation 1:
\[
c + 10 = 20
\]
\[
c = 10
\]

Thus, there are 10 chickens and 10 sheep on the farm.

Finally, verify the number of legs:
- Chickens: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) legs
- Sheep: \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \) legs
- Total legs = \( 20 + 40 = 60 \), which matches the problem's statement.

So, the number of sheep is \( \boxed{10} \).

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Cooper saves by the end of the year if he saves 34 Taka daily.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify the Number of Days in a Year:**
   - A non-leap year has 365 days.
   - For the purpose of this problem, we will assume it is a non-leap year unless specified otherwise.

What is the probability that Jisan’s birthday is on the 31st of June?

## Solution

To determine the probability that Jisan's birthday is on the 31st of June, we need to understand the number of days in the month of June.

1. **Days in June:**
   June is the sixth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar. It has 30 days. Therefore, June 31st is a date that does not exist.

2. **Probability Concept:**
   Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. However, in this case:

   - **Favorable outcomes:** 0 (since June 31st does not exist)
   - **Total possible outcomes:** Not applicable in conventional sense since there's no 31st day in June.

3. **Conclusion:**
   When an event cannot take place because the scenario is impossible (like having a birthday on a nonexistent date), its probability is 0.

Abir took two and a half dozen eggs from the store to his home. When he got home, he found that 3 eggs were rotten. How many good eggs does Abir have?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Quantity of Eggs Initially Taken:**
   - The term ""dozen"" refers to a group of 12 items. 
   - ""Two and a half dozen"" means 2.5 dozen.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs:**
   - To find the total number of eggs Abir has initially, multiply 2.5 by 12 (since each dozen is 12).
   \[
   2.5 \times 12 = 30
   \]
   So, Abir initially took 30 eggs.

3. **Account for the Rotten Eggs:**
   - Abir found that 3 eggs were rotten.

4. **Find the Number of Good Eggs:**
   - To find out how many good eggs are left, subtract the number of rotten eggs from the total number of eggs.

Alok goes to school at 12 o'clock. On Tuesday, Alok's classes occur in the following order: Mathematics, History, Geography, Science, and Music. Alok's Science class has just ended. What is the current time in the afternoon?

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Class Order and Duration**: 

   - The classes follow this sequence: Mathematics, History, Geography, Science, Music.

2. **Determine Time Duration for Each Class**:

   - Although the exact duration for each class isn't specified, let us assume each class takes the same amount of time, denoted by '*x*' hours.

3. **Calculate Time After Science Class**:

   - Alok's school classes start at 12 o'clock (noon). By the time the Science class ends, Alok would have completed 4 classes (Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science).

   - Therefore, the total duration elapsed for these 4 classes is \(4x\).

4. **Consider the Ending of Science Class**:

   - We are asked to find the current time after the Science class ends.

   - Let's use the information that it is now past 4 classes. Therefore, the time elapsed is \(4x\) hours from 12 o'clock.

5. **Determine the Current Time**:

   - The classes begin at 12:00 PM. Adding the 4 classes' time to this starting time gives us the current time directly.

   - Since the problem asks for the current afternoon time without specifying the length of each class, no calculation of hours is required beyond verifying that Alok has concluded 4 classes.

   - It’s reasonable to assume typical class durations are around 1 hour, which fits conventional school schedules.

6. **Final Calculation**:

   If each class lasts 1 hour (a reasonable assumption given typical school schedules), then after 4 classes, the time would be:

   \[
   \text{Current Time} = 12:00 \, \text{PM} + 4 \, \text{hours} = 4:00 \, \text{PM}
   \]

### Conclusion

The current time after Alok's Science class has ended is 4:00 PM.

Abul wrote each English consonant on the board. If each consonant is written 9 times, how many total letters were written on the board?

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the Total Number of Consonants in the English Alphabet:**
   - The English alphabet consists of 26 letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - The vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Therefore, the consonants are the letters that are not vowels.

2. **Count the Number of Consonants:**
   - By removing the vowels (A, E, I, O, U) from the 26 letters, we are left with the consonants.
   - Total vowels = 5 (A, E, I, O, U).
   - Total consonants = 26 letters - 5 vowels = 21 consonants.

3. **Calculate Total Letters Written on the Board:**

A bus from Company A leaves a bus station every 15 minutes, and a bus from Company B leaves every 25 minutes. If both buses leave together at 8:45 AM, what time in the morning will they next leave together?

### Step-by-Step Solution: 
To find the next time both buses will leave together, we need to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of their departure intervals, which are 15 minutes and 25 minutes.

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \( 15 = 3 \times 5 \)
   - \( 25 = 5 \times 5 \)

2. **Calculate the LCM**:
   - To find the LCM, take each prime factor with the highest power from the factorizations.
   - From 15 and 25, the different prime factors are 3 and 5.
   - The highest power of 3 is \(3^1\).
   - The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

   \[
   \text{LCM} = 3^1 \times 5^2 = 3 \times 25 = 75 
   \]

3. **Interpretation of LCM**:
   - The LCM of 75 minutes means both buses will next leave together 75 minutes after their first simultaneous departure at 8:45 AM.

4. **Calculate the Time**:
   - Adding 75 minutes to 8:45 AM:
   - Convert 75 minutes into hours and minutes: \(75 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 15 \text{ minutes}\).
   - 8:45 AM + 1 hour 15 minutes = 9:45 AM + 15 minutes = 10:00 AM.

Hence, the buses from Company A and Company B will leave together again at 10:00 AM.

Ilyas instructs each student in the class to sketch a Roman numeral according to their roll number. The student with roll number 1 will sketch the first Roman numeral, the student with roll number 2 will sketch the second Roman numeral, and so on. Eventually, Ilyas collects all the sketches and finds that there are 17 sketches of each Roman numeral. How many students were there in the class?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Task**:  
   Each student sketches a Roman numeral based on their roll number. If there are 17 sketches of each Roman numeral, it suggests a specific pattern in how the sketches are distributed among the students.

2. **Analyzing the Pattern**:  
   The key information is that each Roman numeral has been sketched 17 times. This implies a cycle in the distribution of sketches.

3. **Formulating the Cycle**:  
   Let's assume the cycle repeats every \( n \) students, where each student from 1 through \( n \) sketches in sequence. After \( n \) students have sketched, the sequence restarts from the first Roman numeral again. 

4. **Determining the Cycle Length**:  
   Given that each Roman numeral is sketched 17 times, the number of students \( n \) must be such that the sketches can complete 17 full cycles. Therefore, the total number of students is \( n \times 17 \).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Since each of the \( n \) Roman numerals is sketched 17 times, it follows that the class must have \( n \times 17 \) students. Calculate the total number of sketches:
   - If there are 17 sketches per Roman numeral and all numerals up to \( n \) are used, then:
     \[
     \text{Total number of students} = n \times 17
     \]
   - Since typically, only the basic Roman numerals up to a certain point would be assigned, let's assume \( n = 10 \) (roman numerals I through X, assuming I, II, III, etc., are being repeated):
   
6. **Solution**:  
   Then the number of students is:
   \[
   n \times 17 = 10 \times 17 = 170
   \]

Thus, the class consisted of 170 students.

In a factory, a machine runs continuously for one and a half weeks. For how many hours in total does the machine operate?

## Detailed Solution:

To find out the total number of hours a machine runs continuously for one and a half weeks, we need to convert the given time period into hours.

1. **Understand the Time Period:**

   - A week consists of 7 days.
   - Since it's specified that the machine runs for one and a half weeks, this time period can be split into one full week and an additional half week.

2. **Calculate the Number of Days:**

The organizers have decided to place free placards in a basket for everyone inside the stadium. Each person picked two placards from the basket, and the organizers had to refill the basket after 39 minutes. How many people have entered the stadium by that time, if the basket can hold 823 placards?

## Step-by-step Solution

1. **Determine the relationship between people and placards:**
   Each person entering the stadium picks up 2 placards from the basket.

2. **Calculate total placards picked by people:**
   If each person picks 2 placards and the basket was full with 823 placards at the start, all these placards must have been picked up when the basket was emptied.

3. **Set up the equation for the number of people:**
   Let \( n \) be the number of people who entered the stadium. Since each person picks 2 placards:
   \[
   2n = 823
   \]

4. **Solve for \( n \):**
   To find the number of people \( n \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   n = \frac{823}{2}
   \]

5. **Compute the result:**
   Dividing 823 by 2 gives:
   \[
   n = 411.5
   \]

The total cost of fencing a square park was 224 taka. How much did it cost to fence each side?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Shape and Dimensions**:
    - Given that the park is square-shaped, it means all four sides of the park are equal in length.

2. **Cost Distribution**:
    - The total cost of fencing is distributed equally along all four sides of the square.

3. **Calculation of Cost per Side**:
    - Let the cost to fence each side be denoted by \( C \).
    - Since it is a square park with four equal sides, the total cost \( 224 \) taka is equally divided among these four sides.
    - Therefore, the equation to represent the total cost is:
      \[
      4C = 224
      \]
    - To find the cost per side, solve for \( C \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
      \[
      C = \frac{224}{4}
      \]

4. **Performing the Division**:
    - Calculate \( \frac{224}{4} \):
      - \( 224 \div 4 = 56 \)

### Conclusion:

Each side of the square park costs 56 taka to fence.

**English Translation:** Alexander needs one sheet of paper to write an alphabet. How many sheets of paper are needed to write the vowels?

## Step 2: Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations

To determine how many sheets of paper Alexander needs to write just the vowels, we first need to identify which letters of the alphabet are vowels.

### Identification of vowels in the English alphabet:
The vowels in the English alphabet are the following letters:
- A
- E
- I
- O
- U

There are a total of 5 vowels in the English alphabet.

### Step-by-step calculation:
1. **Understanding the Requirement**: We know from the problem statement that one sheet of paper is required to write the entire alphabet (which consists of 26 letters).
2. **Determining Paper Usage for Vowels**: Since there are only 5 vowels, the requirement specifies writing only these vowels. 

If one full sheet of paper is enough to write all 26 letters, the implication is that a fraction of this paper is needed to write just the 5 vowels.

3. **Proportional Calculation**: If all 26 letters fit on one sheet, then writing only 5 letters would require about:

   \[
   \frac{5}{26} \text{ of a sheet}
   \]

4. **Considering Whole Sheets**: In practical terms, because paper cannot be divided in actual use, we need a minimum of 1 full sheet as regardless of the fraction, you still need at least one physical sheet to write anything on.

## Conclusion

Given these considerations, Alexander still requires **1 sheet** of paper to write the vowels.

Abha decides to go to a nearby animal farm where there are a total of 9 animals. She is standing in a line near the entrance, from where she sees the animals’ legs and counts a total of 26 legs. She already knows that there are only chickens and buffaloes in this farm. From this information, determine the number of buffaloes.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( b \) represent the number of buffaloes.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Since there are a total of 9 animals, we can write the equation:
     \[
     c + b = 9
     \]

3. **Leg Count Information:**
   - Chickens have 2 legs each.
   - Buffaloes have 4 legs each.
   - The total number of legs counted is 26, leading to the equation:
     \[
     2c + 4b = 26
     \]

4. **Solve the Equations Simultaneously:**

   First, we use the equation from step 2:
   \[
   c + b = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

   Next, use the equation from step 3:
   \[
   2c + 4b = 26 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( c \) in terms of \( b \):
   \[
   c = 9 - b
   \]

   Substitute \( c = 9 - b \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(9 - b) + 4b = 26
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   18 - 2b + 4b = 26
   \]
   \[
   18 + 2b = 26
   \]
   \[
   2b = 26 - 18
   \]
   \[
   2b = 8
   \]
   \[
   b = 4
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   The number of buffaloes is 4. To verify, substitute \( b = 4 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   c + 4 = 9 \implies c"

Maria and Sonia decided to play chess, but there were 4 pieces missing. How many pieces were present?

## Solution:
To determine how many chess pieces were present, we first need to understand how many pieces are typically included in a standard chess set.

A standard chess set consists of:

- 1 King
- 1 Queen
- 2 Rooks
- 2 Knights
- 2 Bishops
- 8 Pawns

These pieces apply to each player, meaning there are two complete sets of these pieces on the board when a game starts, making it a total of:

- 2 Kings: 2 × 1 = 2
- 2 Queens: 2 × 1 = 2
- 4 Rooks: 2 × 2 = 4
- 4 Knights: 2 × 2 = 4
- 4 Bishops: 2 × 2 = 4
- 16 Pawns: 2 × 8 = 16

Adding all these pieces together gives us the total number of pieces in a complete chess set:

\[ 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 16 = 32 \]

According to the problem, 4 pieces are missing from the set. Therefore, we need to subtract 4 from the total number of pieces to find out how many are present:

\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

Thus, there are 28 pieces present.

**English Translation:** Maya saves four coins every day. In how many days does she save a total of 5 rupees?

### Step 2: Understanding the Problem

We need to determine the number of days it takes for Maya to save 5 rupees, given that she saves 4 coins every day.

### Step 3: Conversion of Units

First, we need to establish the conversion rate between coins and rupees:

- In South Asian currency systems, typically 1 rupee is equivalent to 100 coins (since 1 coin is like 1 paisa and 1 rupee = 100 paisa).

### Step 4: Setup the Equation

1. **Total Coins Needed:** To find out how many coins make up 5 rupees, we calculate:
   \[
   5 \text{ rupees} \times 100 \text{ coins/rupee} = 500 \text{ coins}
   \]

2. **Daily Savings in Coins:** Maya saves 4 coins each day.

### Step 5: Solving for the Number of Days

To determine the number of days required to save 500 coins, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Number of Days} = \frac{\text{Total Coins Needed}}{\text{Coins Saved Per Day}}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\text{Number of Days} = \frac{500 \text{ coins}}{4 \text{ coins/day}} = 125 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 6: Conclusion

Thus, it will take Maya 125 days to save a total of 5 rupees.

A square park was fenced, and the total cost of the fencing was 172 taka. What was the cost of fencing per side?

## Solution
To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a square and how costs are distributed across its sides.

1. **Identify the Number of Sides in a Square:**
   - A square has 4 sides. This means that the total cost of fencing is distributed equally among these four sides.

2. **Total Cost and Distribution:**
   - The problem states the total cost of fencing is 172 taka. We are tasked with finding the cost for each of the sides.

3. **Calculate the Cost Per Side:**
   - Since the total fencing cost is evenly spread across 4 sides, we divide the total cost by the number of sides:
   \[
   \text{Cost per side} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sides}} = \frac{172}{4}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{172}{4} = 43
   \]

5. **Verify Calculation:**
   - To make sure the calculation is correct, we can multiply 43 (cost per side) by the number of sides (4):
   \[
   43 \times 4 = 172
   \]
   - The multiplication confirms the total cost, verifying our division was accurate.

Thus, the cost of fencing each side of the square park is 43 taka.

  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total days off in a year.
- There are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the total number of days off Emily takes in a year is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days off/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ days off/year}
  \]

## Conclusion:
Thus, the total number of days Emily takes off in a year is 24 days.

60,ফেব্রুয়ারি মাসের ৩০ তারিখ জিসানের জন্মদিন হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা কত?,0,"### Translation of the Problem:
What is the probability that Jisan's birthday falls on the 30th of February?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Month of February:**
   - The month of February is unique compared to other months of the calendar year.
   - In a common year, February has 28 days.
   - In a leap year, February has 29 days.

2. **Feasibility of February 30th:**
   - According to the established calendar system (Gregorian and Julian), there is no instance where February has 30 days. 
   - Consequently, the 30th of February is a non-existent date.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Probability is calculated as a ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes.
   - In this case, having a birthday on the 30th of February is impossible, as such a date does not exist.
   - Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 0 because there are no conditions under which February 30th is a valid date.
   - The total possible outcomes are any day of the year (365 in a common year or 366 in a leap year). However, since February 30 does not exist, we focus only on this impossibility.

4. **Final Probability:**
   - Since there are 0 favorable outcomes, the probability of Jisan's birthday being on February 30th is:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Possible Outcomes}} = \frac{0}{365 \text{ or } 366} = 0
     \]

### Conclusion:
Since February 30th is not a possible date on the calendar, the probability of Jisan's birthday falling on this date is zero.
