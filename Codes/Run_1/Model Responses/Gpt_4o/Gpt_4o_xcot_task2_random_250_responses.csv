   The problem in English is: ""What is the molar mass of 19 moles of fluorine?""

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To find the molar mass of a certain number of moles of a substance, we need to first understand what is being asked. The question here mentions ""19 moles of fluorine,"" which can be misunderstood if we directly interpret it as the molar mass of the total moles rather than the atomic mass.

   Step 1: **Understanding Molar Mass**

   Fluorine is a diatomic molecule in its natural state, represented by \( \text{F}_2 \). This means two fluorine atoms are bonded together in nature.

   The atomic mass of a single fluorine atom (F) is approximately 19 g/mol. However, since fluorine naturally occurs as \( \text{F}_2 \), its molar mass is twice the atomic mass of a single fluorine atom.

   Step 2: **Calculating the Molar Mass**

   The molar mass of \( \text{F}_2 \) would thus be:
   \[
   19 \, \text{g/mol} \times 2 = 38 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

   But what we are asked here is the molar mass of fluorine, likely referring to \( \text{F}_2 \), not the atomic mass, specifically for a stated 19 moles without needing multiplication since molar mass is independent of the number of moles.

   Therefore, to align with what molar mass is (mass per mole), the molar mass of fluorine (which should relate to fluorine molecule, \( \text{F}_2 \)) is seen as 38 g/mol, as it is constant irrespective of moles. Hence we can deduce it's asking for the molar mass of \( \text{F}_2 \).

   However, if it's expected to calculate the mass for 19 moles, that process isn't asked in naming the solitary molar mass.

   **Conclusion**: Since molar mass does not change with the amount (19 moles or otherwise), it remains:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of } \text{F}_2 = 38 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   So, the molar mass of \( \"

""A circle with a diameter of 2 cm has an arc with a length of 8 cm. What is the angle in radians subtended at the center?""

## Detailed Solution

To find the angle subtended by an arc at the center of a circle in radians, we can use the formula:  
\[
\theta = \frac{L}{r}
\]
where \( \theta \) is the angle in radians, \( L \) is the arc length, and \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

### Step 1: Identify the Given Values
- Diameter of the circle = 2 cm
- Arc length, \( L \) = 8 cm

### Step 2: Calculate the Radius
The diameter of the circle is 2 cm, which means the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{2 \text{ cm}}{2} = 1 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 3: Use the Formula to Find the Angle
Substitute the known values into the formula:
\[
\theta = \frac{L}{r} = \frac{8 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ cm}} = 8 \text{ radians}
\]

Thus, the angle subtended at the center by the arc is 8 radians.

The diameter of a circle is 5 cm. What is the measure of the central angle subtended by an arc 15 cm long, in radians?

### Solution

To find the measure of the central angle in radians subtended by an arc, we use the formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{s}{r}
\]

where:
- \(\theta\) is the central angle in radians,
- \(s\) is the arc length,
- \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

#### Step 1: Calculate the radius

Given that the diameter of the circle is 5 cm, we first find the radius:

\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ cm}
\]

#### Step 2: Use the arc length formula

Given:
- Arc length \(s = 15 \text{ cm}\)
- Radius \(r = 2.5 \text{ cm}\)

Substitute the values into the arc length formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{s}{r} = \frac{15}{2.5}
\]

#### Step 3: Perform the division

\[
\frac{15}{2.5} = 6
\]

Thus, the measure of the central angle is 6 radians.

   What is the probability of getting at most one head when two coins are tossed?

2. **Step-by-Step Solution in English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of obtaining at most one head when two coins are tossed.

   Let's analyze the possible outcomes.

   When two coins are tossed, each coin can either land as heads (H) or tails (T). Therefore, the possible outcomes of tossing two coins are:
   - HH (both coins show heads)
   - HT (first coin shows heads, second coin shows tails)
   - TH (first coin shows tails, second coin shows heads)
   - TT (both coins show tails)

   These outcomes can be listed as: 
   - HH
   - HT
   - TH
   - TT

   There are a total of 4 possible outcomes when we toss two coins.

   We are interested in finding the probability of getting at most one head. ""At most one head"" includes the scenarios where there are no heads or just one head. 
   
   Let's count these outcomes:
   - No heads (0 heads): TT
   - One head (1 head): HT or TH
   
   Therefore, the favorable outcomes for at most one head are:
   - TT
   - HT
   - TH

   This gives us a total of 3 favorable outcomes.

   The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability \(P\) is:

   \[
   P(\text{at most one head}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

From a stationary position, a train begins to move with a uniform acceleration. What speed in meters per second will it have when it passes a post located 250 meters away?

## Solution
To solve this problem, we will use the equations of motion for uniformly accelerated linear motion.

Given:
- Initial velocity (\(u\)) = 0 m/s (since the train starts from rest)
- Distance (\(s\)) = 250 meters
- Acceleration (\(a\)) = 20 m/s²

We need to find the final velocity (\(v\)) of the train when it reaches the post, which is 250 meters away.

We can use the following equation of motion to solve for the final velocity:
\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[
v^2 = 0^2 + 2 \times 20 \times 250
\]
\[
v^2 = 0 + 2 \times 20 \times 250
\]
\[
v^2 = 10000
\]

Taking the square root of both sides to solve for \(v\):
\[
v = \sqrt{10000}
\]
\[
v = 100 \text{ m/s}
\]

Therefore, the speed of the train when it passes the post is 100 meters per second.

   A freely falling object covers a distance of 72 meters in 6 seconds. How much distance will it cover in 3 seconds?

2. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of a freely falling body under gravity, which accelerates uniformly at approximately 9.8 m/s².

   Let's use the basic equations of motion under constant acceleration to find the solution. The equation that relates distance \(s\), initial velocity \(u\), time \(t\), and acceleration \(a\) is:

   \[
   s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
   \]

   Given that the object is in free fall, the initial velocity \(u = 0\), and the acceleration \(a = g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2\).

   So, the equation simplifies to:

   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}gt^2
   \]

   We are given that in 6 seconds the object covers 72 meters:

   \[
   72 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times (6)^2
   \]

   Let's first solve for \(g\) to check consistency:

   \[
   72 = \frac{1}{2} \times g \times 36
   \]

   \[
   72 = 18g
   \]

   \[
   g = \frac{72}{18}
   \]

   \[
   g = 4
   \]

   There seems to be a conceptual error in using standard gravity, or the problem assumes a different gravitational factor for simplicity. So, let's adhere to this factor since it satisfies our initial condition.

   Now, to find the distance covered in 3 seconds with this adjusted acceleration, use the same equation:

   \[
   s_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times (3)^2
   \]

   \[
   s_3 = 2 \times 9
   \]

   \[
   s_3 = 18
   \]

   Therefore, the object covers 18 meters in 3 seconds.

""When an object is released from rest without any obstruction, by how many times will the velocity increase when it has traveled four times the distance?""

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we can use the equations of motion under constant acceleration. If an object is released from rest and moves under constant acceleration, its motion is uniformly accelerated. Let's use the following standard kinematic equations:

1. \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \)  
   where \( v \) is the final velocity, \( u \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( s \) is the distance traveled.

Given that the object is released from rest, we have the initial velocity \( u = 0 \).

### Step 1: Calculate velocity \( v_1 \) after traveling distance \( s \).
For the initial case, let the distance traveled be \( s \). The equation becomes:
\[ v_1^2 = 0^2 + 2as = 2as \]
Thus, the initial velocity after traveling distance \( s \) is:
\[ v_1 = \sqrt{2as} \]

### Step 2: Calculate velocity \( v_2 \) after traveling distance \( 4s \).
Now, consider when the distance is \( 4s \):
\[ v_2^2 = 0^2 + 2a(4s) = 8as \]
Thus, the velocity after traveling distance \( 4s \) is:
\[ v_2 = \sqrt{8as} = \sqrt{4 \times 2as} = 2 \sqrt{2as} \]

### Step 3: Determine the factor by which the velocity increases.
The initial velocity \( v_1 \) after traveling \( s \) is \( \sqrt{2as} \), and the velocity \( v_2 \) after traveling \( 4s \) is \( 2 \sqrt{2as} \).

To find how many times \( v_2 \) is greater than \( v_1 \), we compute the ratio:
\[ \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{2 \sqrt{2as}}{\sqrt{2as}} = 2 \]

Thus, the velocity increases by a factor of 2.

What is the percentage of oxygen in glucose?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of oxygen in the chemical compound known as glucose. The chemical formula for glucose is \( C_6H_{12}O_6 \).

1. **Identify the Atomic Weights:**
   - Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12 amu (atomic mass units).
   - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1 amu.
   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16 amu.

2. **Calculate the Molar Mass of Glucose:**
   The molar mass of glucose can be calculated by summing up the total weights of all the atoms in one molecule of glucose based on its chemical formula \( C_6H_{12}O_6 \).

   - Carbon: \( 6 \times 12 = 72 \) amu
   - Hydrogen: \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) amu
   - Oxygen: \( 6 \times 16 = 96 \) amu

   Now, add these to find the total molar mass:
   \[
   72 + 12 + 96 = 180 \text{ amu}
   \]

3. **Determine the Percentage of Oxygen:**
   The percentage of oxygen in glucose is calculated by dividing the total mass of the oxygen atoms in the glucose molecule by the molar mass of glucose and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

   - Total mass of oxygen: 96 amu
   - Molar mass of glucose: 180 amu

   \[
   \text{Percentage of Oxygen} = \left( \frac{96}{180} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Oxygen} = \left( \frac{96}{180} \right) \times 100 \approx 53.33\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of oxygen in glucose is approximately \( 53.33\% \).

The diameter of a car's wheel is 0.8 meters, and the wheel rotates 6 times per second. What is the speed of the car in kilometers per hour?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Circumference of the Wheel:**
   The first step is to calculate the circumference of the wheel, which is the distance the car travels in one complete rotation of the wheel. The formula for the circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by:
   \[
   C = \pi \times d
   \]
   where \(d\) is the diameter. In this case, \(d = 0.8\) meters. Thus,
   \[
   C = \pi \times 0.8 \approx 3.14 \times 0.8 = 2.512 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Distance Travelled per Second:**
   Since the wheel rotates 6 times per second, the distance traveled by the car in one second is:
   \[
   \text{Distance per second} = 6 \times C = 6 \times 2.512 = 15.072 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Convert Meters per Second to Kilometers per Hour:**
   To convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour, use the conversion factor that 1 m/s is equivalent to 3.6 km/h. Therefore, the speed in kilometers per hour is:
   \[
   \text{Speed in km/h} = 15.072 \times 3.6 = 54.2592
   \]

4. **Round the Result:**
   The calculated speed of the car is approximately 54.2592 km/h, which can be rounded to 54.26 km/h depending on the required precision.

### Conclusion:
The speed of the car is approximately **54.26 km/h**.

A solid metallic sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. What is the radius of the resulting cylinder in cm?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Volume of the Sphere:**
   The volume \( V \) of a sphere is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the given radius:
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 = 288 \pi \, \text{cubic cm}
   \]

2. **Volume of the Cylinder:**
   When the sphere is melted into a cylinder, the volume of the cylinder will be equal to the volume of the sphere since no material is lost. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   V = \pi R^2 H
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius and \( H \) is the height. We know that \( H = 32 \, \text{cm} \).

3. **Equating the Volumes:**
   Since the sphere is melted to form this cylinder, we set the volume of the sphere equal to the volume of the cylinder:
   \[
   288 \pi = \pi R^2 \times 32
   \]

4. **Solving for the Cylinder's Radius:**
   We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides and solve for \( R^2 \):

   \[
   R^2 = \frac{288}{32} = 9

A solid metallic sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

### Solution:
To find the curved surface area of the cylinder, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the volume of the sphere:**

   The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
   \[
   V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

   Given \( r = 6 \) cm, the volume becomes:
   \[
   V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **The volume of the sphere equals the volume of the cylinder:**

   Since the sphere is melted and recast into a cylinder, the volume of the cylinder \( V_{\text{cylinder}} \) is the same as that of the sphere:
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

3. **Relate the volume of the cylinder to its dimensions:**

   The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

   Given \( h = 32 \) cm, substitute into the volume equation:
   \[
   288\pi = \pi r^2 \times 32
   \]

4. **Solve for the radius of the cylinder:**

   By dividing both sides by \( \pi \) and 32, we get:

   r^2 = \frac{288}{32}

   \[
   r^2 = 9

A 10 kg stationary object is subjected to a force of 22 Newtons for 10 seconds. The frictional force on the surface where the object is moving is 2 Newtons. What is the velocity of the object in meters per second after 10 seconds?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Forces in Action:**

   - **Applied Force (F_applied):** 22 N
   - **Frictional Force (F_friction):** 2 N
   - **Net Force (F_net):** This is the force that actually acts on the object to cause acceleration. It is given by:
     \[
     F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{applied}} - F_{\text{friction}} = 22\, \text{N} - 2\, \text{N} = 20\, \text{N}
     \]

2. **Calculating the Acceleration:**

   Using Newton's second law of motion:
   \[
   F = ma
   \]
   where \( F \) is the net force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   20\, \text{N} = 10\, \text{kg} \times a
   \]
   Solving for \( a \):
   \[
   a = \frac{20\, \text{N}}{10\, \text{kg}} = 2\, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

3. **Calculating the Final Velocity:**

   The initial velocity (\( u \)) of the object is 0 m/s as it is stationary. The final velocity (\( v \)) after a time (\( t \)) can be found using the formula:
   \[
   v = u + at

If 10 divisions of the Vernier scale correspond to 9 divisions of the main scale, what is the Vernier constant in centimeters?

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Concept**:
   - In a Vernier caliper, the Vernier constant is the smallest measurement that can be accurately determined and is usually defined as the difference between one division of the main scale and one division of the Vernier scale.
   - We have that 10 divisions on the Vernier scale are equal to 9 divisions on the main scale.

2. **Finding the Length of a Single Division**:
   - Let the length of one division on the main scale be \( x \) centimeters.
   - Then, 9 divisions on the main scale measure \( 9x \) centimeters.
   - Since 10 divisions on the Vernier scale equal 9 divisions on the main scale, the length of one division on the Vernier scale is \( \frac{9x}{10} \) centimeters.

3. **Calculating the Vernier Constant**:
   - The Vernier constant is the difference between one main scale division and one Vernier scale division.
   - Therefore, the Vernier constant is: 
     \[
     x - \frac{9x}{10} = \frac{10x}{10} - \frac{9x}{10} = \frac{x}{10}
     \]

4. **Expressing in Specific Units**:
   - The Vernier constant is therefore \(\frac{1}{10}th\) of a main scale division.
   - If not explicitly given, assume \( x \), the main scale division, is standardized to 1 cm for simplicity.
   - Hence, \(\frac{x}{10} = \frac{1}{10}\) centimeters is the Vernier constant.

**Conclusion**:
The Vernier constant measures how finely one can read using the Vernier caliper, and in this problem, it is calculated as \(\frac{1}{10}\) cm.

   - We need the outcomes where the numbers on the top faces of the two dice are different.
   - Let's calculate the outcomes where the numbers are the same and then subtract from the total.
   - If both dice show the same number, the possibilities are: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6).
   - There are 6 such outcomes where the numbers are the same.

4. **Outcomes Where Numbers are Different:**
   - Since we have a total of 36 outcomes and 6 outcomes where the numbers are the same:
   - The number of outcomes where the numbers on the dice are different is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   - The probability that the numbers on the two dice are different is thus \(\frac{30}{36}\).

6. **Simplifying the Probability:**
   - Simplifying \(\frac{30}{36}\):
   - \(\frac{30}{36} = \frac{5}{6}\).

### Conclusion:
The probability that when two dice are thrown, they do not show the same number on their top faces is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

   What is the complement of a 50-degree angle when expressed in circular measure?

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations:**

   To find the complement of an angle, we need to understand the basic concept of complementary angles. Two angles are said to be complementary if their sum is 90 degrees. Therefore, the complement of any angle \( x \) is given by \( 90^\circ - x \).

   For this problem, we have an angle of 50 degrees. So, we first find its complement in degrees:

   \[
   \text{Complement in degrees} = 90^\circ - 50^\circ = 40^\circ
   \]

   Next, we need to convert this angle from degrees to radians (circular measure). The conversion factor between degrees and radians is:

   \[
   1 \text{ degree} = \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ radians}
   \]

   Thus, to convert 40 degrees to radians, we multiply by this conversion factor:

   \[
   40^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{40\pi}{180} = \frac{2\pi}{9} \text{ radians}
   \]

3. **Conclusion with the final numerical answer:**

   The complement of a 50-degree angle in circular measure is \(\frac{2\pi}{9}\) radians.

   ""What is the contribution of sulfur in sulfuric acid?""

2. **Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations in English:**

   To solve this problem, we'll need to determine the percentage by mass of sulfur in the compound sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

   **Step 1: Determine the molar mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).**

   The chemical formula for sulfuric acid is H₂SO₄, which means each molecule consists of:
   - 2 hydrogen (H) atoms
   - 1 sulfur (S) atom
   - 4 oxygen (O) atoms

   Next, we find the atomic mass of each element:
   - The atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1.01 g/mol
   - The atomic mass of Sulfur (S) = 32.07 g/mol
   - The atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol

   Now, calculate the molar mass of H₂SO₄:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of } \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 = (2 \times 1.01) + (1 \times 32.07) + (4 \times 16.00)
   \]
   \[
   = 2.02 + 32.07 + 64.00
   \]
   \[
   = 98.09 \text{ g/mol}
   \]

   **Step 2: Determine the contribution of sulfur in sulfuric acid.**

   We need to calculate the percentage of the total molar mass that is contributed by sulfur. We do this by dividing the mass of sulfur by the total molar mass of sulfuric acid and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

   \[
   \text{Percentage of sulfur} = \left(\frac{32.07}{98.09}\right) \times 100\%
   \]
   \[
   = 0.3268 \times 100\%

A wheel with a diameter of 0.20 meters travels how many meters when it completes one full rotation?

### Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the circumference of the wheel. The circumference is the distance that the wheel travels in one complete rotation.

The formula to calculate the circumference \( C \) of a circle (or a wheel, in this case) is given by:
\[
C = \pi \times d
\]
where \( d \) is the diameter of the circle.

In this problem, the diameter \( d \) of the wheel is 0.20 meters. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the formula:

The difference in the circumference of two wheels is 120 cm. What is the difference in their radii in cm?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the circumference and the radius of a circle. The formula to find the circumference \( C \) of a circle given its radius \( r \) is:

\[ C = 2\pi r \]

Let's denote the radii of the two circles as \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), where \( r_1 > r_2 \).

The circumferences of these two circles will therefore be:
1. \( C_1 = 2\pi r_1 \)
2. \( C_2 = 2\pi r_2 \)

We know from the problem that the difference in their circumferences is 120 cm. So we can write:

\[ C_1 - C_2 = 120 \]

Substituting the formulas for the circumferences, we get:

\[ 2\pi r_1 - 2\pi r_2 = 120 \]

We can factor out the common term of \( 2\pi \):

\[ 2\pi (r_1 - r_2) = 120 \]

Divide both sides of the equation by \( 2\pi \) to solve for \( r_1 - r_2 \):

\[ r_1 - r_2 = \frac{120}{2\pi} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ r_1 - r_2 = \frac{60}{\pi} \]

To find a numerical approximation, we substitute the approximate value of \(\pi\) (~3.14159):

\[ r_1 - r_2 \approx \frac{60}{3.14159} \approx 19.098 \]

Therefore, the difference in their radii, approximately equals 19.098 cm.

In Lincoln's toy box, there are toys representing each number in the binary numeral system. There are 6 more toy boxes for Lincoln’s siblings. How many toys are there in total?

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to derive the number of binary representations (toys) possible with a given number of bits, assuming each representation corresponds to a distinct toy. However, the problem does not specify the number of bits or the range of binary numbers represented. Therefore, we will consider a general approach assuming each box contains the complete set of binary numbers for a certain number of bits.

### Assumptions:
1. Assume each toy box contains all binary numbers that can be represented with `n` bits.
2. The number of distinct binary numbers with `n` bits is \(2^n\). This is because for each bit, there are two possible values (0 or 1), and thus \(2^n\) combinations.

### Calculation:
1. If Lincoln's toy box contains binary numbers represented with `n` bits, it would contain \(2^n\) toys.
2. In addition to Lincoln's box, there are 6 more boxes identical to Lincoln's, for his siblings.

3. Therefore, the total number of toy boxes is \(1 + 6 = 7\).

4. Each of these toy boxes contains \((2^n)\) toys. Thus, the total number of toys across all boxes is:
   \[
   7 \times 2^n
   \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of `n`, we can't compute a specific numerical answer without further information. Thus, the answer would depend on the number of bits represented by `n`.

**Final Answer Format:**
The total number of toys in all boxes is given by the expression \(7 \times 2^n\), where `n` is the number of bits for each binary representation.

**Translated:** When 200 grams of limestone is heated in an open vessel, how much calcium oxide will be obtained?

## Solution:

Limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). When calcium carbonate is heated, it decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The chemical reaction can be represented as follows:

\[ \text{CaCO}_3 \, (\text{s}) \rightarrow \text{CaO} \, (\text{s}) + \text{CO}_2 \, (\text{g}) \]

To find out how much calcium oxide is produced, we need to use stoichiometry based on the molar masses of the substances involved.

1. **Calculate Molar Mass:**

    - Molar mass of CaCO₃:

      - Calcium (Ca): 40.08 g/mol
      - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
      - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol (since there are 3 oxygen atoms, 16.00 \(\times\) 3 = 48.00)

      \[ \text{Molar mass of CaCO}_3 = 40.08 \, + \, 12.01 \, + \, 48.00 = 100.09 \text{ g/mol} \]

    - Molar mass of CaO:

      - Calcium (Ca): 40.08 g/mol
      - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

      \[ \text{Molar mass of CaO} = 40.08 + 16.00 = 56.08 \text{ g/mol} \]

2. **Convert Grams to Moles:**

    Calculate the moles of CaCO₃:

    \[ \text{Moles of CaCO}_3 = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{100.09 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 2.00 \text{ moles} \]

3. **Use Stoichiometry to Find Moles of CaO:**

    From the balanced chemical equation, 1 mole of CaCO₃ produces 1 mole of CaO. Therefore, 2.00 moles of CaCO"

   According to Newton's second law, the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:
   \[
   F_{\text{net}} = m \times a
   \]

3. **Calculate the Net Force:**

   \]

4. **Relationship Between Applied Force, Frictional Force, and Net Force:**
   The applied force is countered by the frictional force (\( F_{\text{friction}} \)) and results in the net force. Thus, the equation is:
   \[
   F_{\text{applied}} - F_{\text{friction}} = F_{\text{net}}
   \]

5. **Solve for Frictional Force:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for the frictional force:
   \[
   F_{\text{friction}} = F_{\text{applied}} - F_{\text{net}}

   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   F_{\text{friction}} = 30 \, \text{N} - 24 \, \text{N} = 6 \, \text{N}

The diameter of a circle is 9 cm. What is the radian measure of the central angle subtended by an arc of 15 cm?

### Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the central angle in radians for a given arc length. The formula to find the radian measure of a central angle (\(\theta\)) given the arc length (\(s\)) and the radius (\(r\)) of the circle is:

\[
\theta = \frac{s}{r}
\]

**Step 1: Determine the radius of the circle.**

The problem states that the diameter of the circle is 9 cm. Since the radius is half of the diameter, we have:

\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{9 \text{ cm}}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cm}

**Step 2: Plug the values into the formula.**

We are given the arc length \(s = 15 \text{ cm}\) and have found the radius \(r = 4.5 \text{ cm}\). Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{s}{r} = \frac{15 \text{ cm}}{4.5 \text{ cm}}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the central angle.**

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\theta = \frac{15}{4.5} = \frac{150}{45} = \frac{10}{3}

In a hydraulic press, the areas of the small and large pistons are 5 square centimeters and 25 square centimeters, respectively. If a force of 100 Newtons is applied to the small piston, what force will be obtained on the large piston?

### Solution:
This problem involves using **Pascal's Principle**, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions throughout the fluid. The principle is often applied in hydraulic systems.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Identify the area of the pistons:**
   - Area of the small piston, \( A_1 = 5 \) cm².
   - Area of the large piston, \( A_2 = 25 \) cm².

2. **Identify the force applied to the small piston:**
   - Force applied, \( F_1 = 100 \) N.

3. **According to Pascal's Principle, the pressure (\( P \)) on the small piston will be the same as on the large piston:**
   \[
   P_1 = P_2

To solve this problem, we start by listing all the possible outcomes when two coins are tossed. Each coin has two possible outcomes: Heads (H) and Tails (T). Therefore, for two coins, the possible outcomes are:

1. (H, H) - Both coins show Heads.
2. (H, T) - First coin shows Heads, and second coin shows Tails.
3. (T, H) - First coin shows Tails, and second coin shows Heads.
4. (T, T) - Both coins show Tails.

The problem in English is: ""What is the molecular mass of 6 moles of nitrogen?""

## Solution
To find the molecular mass of 6 moles of nitrogen, we first need to know the molecular mass of a single mole of nitrogen.

### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Mass of Nitrogen
- Nitrogen is a diatomic molecule, represented as \(N_2\).
- The atomic mass of a single nitrogen atom (\(N\)) is approximately 14 grams/mole.
- Therefore, the molecular mass of nitrogen gas (\(N_2\)) is:
  \[
  2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ grams/mole}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Mass of 6 Moles of Nitrogen
- Given that the molecular mass of one mole of \(N_2\) is 28 grams, for 6 moles, the calculation is:
  \[
  6 \times 28 = 168 \text{ grams}
  \]

So, the molecular mass of 6 moles of nitrogen gas (\(N_2\)) is 168 grams.

5 grams of hydrogen gas is passed into 75 grams of chlorine gas. How many moles of hydrogen remain after the reaction?

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the chemical reaction between hydrogen and chlorine. The reaction is:

\[ \text{H}_2 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HCl} \]

This is a stoichiometric reaction where 1 mole of \(\text{H}_2\) reacts with 1 mole of \(\text{Cl}_2\) to produce 2 moles of \(\text{HCl}\).

**Step 1: Calculate the moles of \( \text{H}_2 \) and \( \text{Cl}_2 \).**

- The molar mass of hydrogen (\(\text{H}_2\)) is approximately 2 g/mol.
- The molar mass of chlorine (\(\text{Cl}_2\)) is approximately 71 g/mol.

Calculate the number of moles of hydrogen gas:

\[
\text{Moles of } \text{H}_2 = \frac{\text{mass of } \text{H}_2}{\text{molar mass of } \text{H}_2} = \frac{5 \text{ g}}{2 \text{ g/mol}} = 2.5 \text{ moles}
\]

Calculate the number of moles of chlorine gas:

\[
\text{Moles of } \text{Cl}_2 = \frac{\text{mass of } \text{Cl}_2}{\text{molar mass of } \text{Cl}_2} = \frac{75 \text{ g}}{71 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 1.056 \text{ moles}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the limiting reagent.**

From the stoichiometry of the reaction, we see that it takes 1 mole of \(\text{H}_2\) to react with 1 mole of \(\text{Cl}_2\).

- We have 2.5 moles of \(\text{H}_2\).
- We have 1.056 moles of \(\text{Cl}_2\).

Since 1.056 moles of \(\text{Cl}_2\) can only fully react with 1.056 moles of \(\text{H}_2"

In a 100 mL solution, what is the concentration of 0.4 grams of sodium hydroxide?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the concentration of sodium hydroxide in a solution, we need to calculate its molarity. Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**

The molecular weight of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:
- Sodium (Na) = 23 g/mol
- Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H) = 1 g/mol

So, the molecular weight of NaOH = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol.

To find the number of moles, use the formula:

\[
\text{Number of moles} = \frac{\text{Mass of solute (g)}}{\text{Molar mass of solute (g/mol)}}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Number of moles of NaOH} = \frac{0.4 \text{ g}}{40 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.01 \text{ mol}
\]

**Step 2: Convert the volume of solution from milliliters to liters.**

The volume of the solution is given as 100 mL. We need this in liters because molarity is calculated in terms of liters.

\[
100 \text{ mL} = 0.1 \text{ L}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the molarity of the solution.**

Molarity (M) is given by:

\[
M = \frac{\text{Number of moles of solute}}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
M = \frac{0.01 \text{ mol}}{0.1 \text{ L}} = 0.1 \text{ M}
\]

Therefore, the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution is **0.1 M**.

At the peak of a mountain, the value of gravitational acceleration is 9.77 m/s². What is the height of the mountain in meters?

## Solution:
To find the height of the mountain, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration variation with altitude. The formula is derived from the concept that the gravitational acceleration \( g \) at a height \( h \) above sea level is given by:

\[ g' = g \left(1 - \frac{2h}{R}\right) \]

Where:
- \( g' \) is the gravitational acceleration at height \( h \) (9.77 m/s² in this case),
- \( g \) is the standard gravitational acceleration at sea level (approximately 9.81 m/s²),
- \( R \) is the Earth's radius (approximately 6,371,000 meters).

Rearrange the equation to solve for height \( h \):

\[ 9.77 = 9.81 \left(1 - \frac{2h}{6,371,000}\right) \]

Divide both sides by 9.81:

\[ \frac{9.77}{9.81} = 1 - \frac{2h}{6,371,000} \]

\[ 1 - \frac{9.77}{9.81} = \frac{2h}{6,371,000} \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ \frac{2h}{6,371,000} = 1 - \frac{9.77}{9.81} \approx 1 - 0.9959 \approx 0.0041 \]

Now solve for \( h\):

\[ 2h = 0.0041 \times 6,371,000 \]

\[ 2h = 26121.1 \, \text{m} \]

\[ h = \frac{26121.1}{2} \]

\[ h \approx 13060.55 \, \text{m} \]

However, this value seems unrealistically high. Reevaluating without approximation gives a more reasonable outcome. Let's recheck our operations.

1. Subtraction result:

\[ 1 - \frac{9.77}{9.81} = 0.00408 \]

A driver traveling at 54 km/h sees a pedestrian 46 meters away and immediately applies the brakes. The car stops 1 meter in front of the pedestrian. What was the car's acceleration?

## Detailed Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the acceleration of the car as it comes to a stop. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Convert the Speed to Meters per Second:**
   The speed of the car is given as 54 km/h. To convert this speed to meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor \( \frac{5}{18} \) (since \( 1 \text{ km/h} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ m/s} \)).

   \[
   54 \, \text{km/h} = 54 \times \frac{5}{18} \, \text{m/s} = 15 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

2. **Determine the Stopping Distance:**
   The car stops 1 meter in front of the pedestrian who was initially 46 meters away. Therefore, the stopping distance (the distance over which the car decelerates) is:

   \[
   \text{Stopping distance} = 46 - 1 = 45 \, \text{meters}
   \]

3. **Use the Kinematic Equation:**
   We can use the kinematic equation that relates initial velocity (\(v_i\)), final velocity (\(v_f\)), acceleration (\(a\)), and stopping distance (\(d\)):

   \[
   v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad
   \]

   Here, \(v_f = 0\) (since the car stops), \(v_i = 15 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(d = 45 \, \text{m}\). Plug these values into the equation:

   \[
   0 = (15)^2 + 2a(45)
   \]

4. **Solve for Acceleration:**
   Rearranging the equation to solve for \(a\):

   \[
   0 = 225 + 90a
   \]
   \[
   90a = -225
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{-225}{90} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s}^2

- The molar mass of oxygen (\(O_2\)) is approximately 32 g/mol.

**Determining Moles:**
1. **Moles of sodium present:**
   \[ \text{Moles of } Na = \frac{46 \text{ g}}{23 \text{ g/mol}} = 2 \text{ moles} \]

2. **Moles of oxygen available:**
   \[ \text{Moles of } O_2 = \frac{64 \text{ g}}{32 \text{ g/mol}} = 2 \text{ moles} \]

Translated into English: ""If an object tied to a string is swung in a vertical plane and brought back to its starting point once, how much work is done in joules?""

## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - An object tied to a string is swung around in a vertical circle and returns to its starting position.

2. **Conceptual Analysis:**
   - When an object tied with a string is swung in a vertical loop, it moves in a circular path.
   - As it returns to its starting point, it completes one full rotation.
   - The key factor to determine the work done is understanding that work is force applied over a distance.

3. **Important Physics Concepts:**
   - In circular motion, centripetal force is required to keep the object moving in a circle. This force doesn't do work because it acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.
   - The object returns to the same point height-wise, meaning gravitational potential energy remains constant across the closed loop path.

4. **Work Done Formula:**
   - Work = Force × Distance × cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the force direction and the direction of motion.
   - During movement in a circle, since the angle between the force direction (centripetal) and motion is 90 degrees, the cosine of 90 is 0.

5. **Calculation of Work Done:**
   - Since no energy is transferred to or from the gravitational field (i.e., no net change in gravitational potential energy) and centripetal force does no work (since no displacement in the direction of the force), the total work done over a complete circle is 0 Joules.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The work done on the object during one complete rotation in the vertical plane is 0 Joules.

- The initial velocity (\( v_i \)) is 15 m/s,
- The final velocity (\( v_f \)) is 75 m/s,
- The time period (\( t \)) is 10 seconds.

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

\[
a = \frac{75 \, \text{m/s} - 15 \, \text{m/s}}{10 \, \text{s}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a = \frac{60 \, \text{m/s}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 6 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Therefore, the acceleration of the car is \( 6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Pavel mentioned that he had 100000 (in binary) bananas. He distributed the bananas among 1000 (in binary) people. According to our number system, how many bananas will each person get?

## Step 2: Convert the binary numbers to decimal numbers

To solve the problem, we first need to convert the binary numbers to decimal numbers.

1. **Convert 100000 (binary) to decimal:**
   
   \(100000_2\) represents a binary number. We calculate its decimal equivalent as follows:
   - The binary number \(100000_2\) can be expanded as:
     \[
     1 \times 2^5 + 0 \times 2^4 + 0 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0
     \]

   - Simplifying the expression, we get:
     \[
     1 \times 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 32
     \]

   So, 100000 in binary is 32 in decimal.

2. **Convert 1000 (binary) to decimal:**

   \(1000_2\) represents a binary number. We calculate its decimal equivalent as follows:
   - The binary number \(1000_2\) can be expanded as:
     \[
     1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0
     \]
   
   - Simplifying the expression, we get:
     \[
     1 \times 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8
     \]

   So, 1000 in binary is 8 in decimal.

## Step 3: Calculate how many bananas each person will get

Now that we know the total number of bananas in decimal (32) and the total number of people in decimal (8), we can calculate how many bananas each person will receive:

\[
\text{Number of bananas each person gets} = \frac{\text{Total number of bananas}}{\text{Total number of people}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Each person will get 4 bananas.

If a coin is tossed three times, what is the probability of getting at least one head?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Total Possible Outcomes:**

   When a coin is tossed once, there are 2 possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).

   When tossed three times, the outcomes are combinations of the results of each toss. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times is given by:
   
   \[
   2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^3 = 8
   \]

   These outcomes are: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, and TTT.

2. **Calculating the Probability of At Least One Head:**

   To find the probability of getting at least one head, we use the complementary probability approach, which is often simpler.

   The complementary event is ""not getting any head,"" which means getting all tails (TTT) in this context.

   There is only 1 such outcome (TTT).

3. **Finding the Probability of the Complementary Event:**

   The probability of getting tails in all three tosses (TTT) is calculated as follows:

   \[
   P(\text{All tails}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes for no heads (TTT)}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
   \]

   \[
   P(\text{All tails}) = \frac{1}{8}
   \]

4. **Finding the Probability of Getting At Least One Head:**

   The probability of getting at least one head is the complement of the probability of getting all tails:

   \[
   P(\text{At least one head}) = 1 - P(\text{All tails})
   \]

   \[
   P(\text{At least one head}) = 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
   \]

""What is the volume of 88 grams of carbon dioxide gas at standard temperature and pressure?""

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of carbon dioxide gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP is commonly defined as a temperature of \(0^\circ\) Celsius (273.15 K) and a pressure of 1 atm.

**Step 1: Determine the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO\(_2\)):**

Carbon dioxide (CO\(_2\)) consists of one carbon (C) atom and two oxygen (O) atoms.

- The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.
- The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.

Thus, the molar mass of CO\(_2\) is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Molar mass of CO\(_2\)} = 12.01 \, \text{g/mol} + 2 \times 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 44.01 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of CO\(_2\) present:**

We have 88 grams of CO\(_2\), and the molar mass is 44.01 g/mol. The number of moles (\(n\)) is determined using the formula:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{88 \, \text{g}}{44.01 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2 \, \text{moles}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the volume of the gas at STP:**

At standard temperature and pressure, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, the volume \(V\) of the gas can be determined by:

\[
V = n \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 2 \, \text{moles} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 44.8 \, \text{L}
\]

**Conclusion:**

The volume of 88 grams of carbon dioxide gas at standard temperature and pressure is 44.8 liters.

Determine the percentage by mass of aluminum in aluminum hydroxide.

**Solution:**

To find the percentage by mass of aluminum in aluminum hydroxide, we first need to determine the molar mass of aluminum hydroxide and then calculate how much of that mass is contributed by aluminum.

1. **Chemical Formula**:
   - Aluminum hydroxide is represented by the chemical formula \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \).

2. **Molar Mass Calculation**:
   - **Aluminum (Al)**: The atomic mass of aluminum is approximately \( 27 \, \text{g/mol} \).
   - **Oxygen (O)**: The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately \( 16 \, \text{g/mol} \).
   - **Hydrogen (H)**: The atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately \( 1 \, \text{g/mol} \).

3. **Calculate Molar Mass of \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \)**:
   - The molar mass of the compound \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \) is calculated by summing the masses of all the atoms present:
     \[
     \text{Molar mass of } \text{Al(OH)}_3 = 1(\text{Al}) + 3(\text{O}) + 3(\text{H})
     \]
     \[
     = 27 \, \text{g/mol} + 3(16 \, \text{g/mol}) + 3(1 \, \text{g/mol})

     \[
     = 27 \, \text{g/mol} + 48 \, \text{g/mol} + 3 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
     \[

5 grams of coke and 5 grams of oxygen react to produce carbon dioxide. How many grams of coke will remain at the end of the reaction?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we must understand the chemical reaction involved. Coke primarily consists of carbon. The reaction we are considering is the combustion of carbon (coke) to form carbon dioxide, described by the chemical equation:

\[ \text{C} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 \]

Given:
- Mass of coke (carbon) = 5 grams
- Mass of oxygen (\( \text{O}_2 \)) = 5 grams

**1. Determine the Molecular Masses:**

- The atomic mass of carbon (C) = 12 g/mol
- The molecular mass of oxygen (\( \text{O}_2 \)) = 32 g/mol

**2. Calculate Moles of Each Reactant:**

Calculate the number of moles of coke (carbon):
\[ \text{Moles of C} = \frac{\text{mass of C}}{\text{atomic mass of C}} = \frac{5 \text{ g}}{12 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.417 \text{ moles} \]

Calculate the number of moles of oxygen:
\[ \text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{\text{mass of O}_2}{\text{molecular mass of O}_2} = \frac{5 \text{ g}}{32 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.156 \text{ moles} \]

**3. Identify the Limiting Reactant:**

According to the balanced equation, the reaction requires 1 mole of \(\text{C}\) to react with 1 mole of \(\text{O}_2\).

- It is clear from the calculations that the moles of \(\text{O}_2\) (0.156 moles) are less than the moles of \(\text{C}\) (0.417 moles).

Thus, \(\text{O}_2\) is the limiting reactant.

The problem in English is: What is the probability of selecting a perfect square number when choosing randomly from the first twenty-five natural numbers?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen number from the first 25 natural numbers (1 through 25) is a perfect square.

#### Step 1: Identify the Perfect Square Numbers
A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. We need to determine the perfect square numbers between 1 and 25.

The integers whose square lies within 1 and 25 are:
- \(1^2 = 1\)
- \(2^2 = 4\)
- \(3^2 = 9\)
- \(4^2 = 16\)
- \(5^2 = 25\)

So the perfect squares are: 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25.

#### Step 2: Count the Number of Favorable Outcomes
The favorable outcomes, i.e., the perfect squares from 1 to 25, are 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25. There are a total of 5 perfect square numbers.

#### Step 3: Determine the Total Number of Possible Outcomes
The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of natural numbers from 1 to 25, which is 25.

#### Step 4: Calculate the Probability
The probability \( P \) of selecting a perfect square number is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{5}{25} = \frac{1}{5}

### Solution:
To find the pressure at the bottom of the pond when it is half full, we need to use the formula for pressure due to a column of liquid:

\[ P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure in Pascals (Pa).
- \( \rho \) is the density of the liquid (for water, \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)).
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\(g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\)).
- \( h \) is the height of the liquid column, which, in this case, is half the total height of the pond.

Given:
- Total height of the pond = 3 meters.
  
Since the pond is half full, the height of the water column (h) will be:

\[ h = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \, \text{meters} \]

Now substituting the values into the pressure formula:

\[ P = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 1.5 \, \text{m} \]

\[ P = 14715 \, \text{Pa} \]

What is the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas at standard conditions?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas at standard conditions (usually 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atm pressure), we use the concept of molar volume of a gas.

### Step 1: Determine the Molar Mass of Hydrogen
Hydrogen gas (\(H_2\)) consists of two hydrogen atoms. The atomic mass of a single hydrogen atom is approximately \(1\) gram/mole. Therefore, the molar mass of \(H_2\) is:
\[ 2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{grams/mole} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Moles
Using the given mass of hydrogen gas, we calculate the number of moles (\(n\)) using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of moles} (n) = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{2 \, \text{grams}}{2 \, \text{grams/mole}} = 1 \, \text{mole} \]

### Step 3: Use the Molar Volume at Standard Conditions
At standard temperature and pressure (STP; 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atm), one mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters.

### Step 4: Calculate the Volume
Since we have 1 mole of hydrogen gas, using the molar volume, we can directly determine its volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = 1 \, \text{mole} \times 22.4 \, \text{liters/mole} = 22.4 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas at standard conditions is 22.4 liters.

If an object is dropped from a height of 100 meters, what will be its velocity (in m/s) when it hits the ground?

## Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use the kinematic equations of motion under gravity. Given the following variables:
- Initial velocity (\(u\)) = 0 m/s (since the object is dropped)
- Height (\(h\)) = 100 meters
- Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) = 9.8 m/s²
- Final velocity (\(v\)) = ? (this is what we need to find)

We can use the equation of motion:

\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2gh \]

Insert the given values into the equation:

\[ v^2 = 0 + 2 \times 9.8 \times 100 \]
\[ v^2 = 19.6 \times 100 \]
\[ v^2 = 1960 \]

To find the final velocity (\(v\)), take the square root of both sides:

\[ v = \sqrt{1960} \]

We calculate:

\[ v \approx 44.27 \]

\[
\text{Arc Length} = 2 \pi r \times \frac{\theta}{360^\circ}
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle,
- \( \theta \) is the angle subtended by the arc at the center in degrees.

Given:
- Radius \( r = 2 \) cm
- Angle \( \theta = 180^\circ \)

Where:
- \( K \) represents the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( °C \) represents the temperature in Celsius.

This formula shows that the Kelvin scale has the same increment as the Celsius scale. In other words, a change in temperature by 1 degree Celsius results in a change of 1 Kelvin.

What is the percentage of hydrogen in water?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine the percentage of hydrogen in water (H₂O), we first need to know the composition of a water molecule. 

1. **Composition of Water:**
   - A water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. This is represented by the chemical formula H₂O.

2. **Atomic Weights:**
   - The atomic weight of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 gram/mole.
   - The atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 grams/mole.

3. **Molecular Weight of Water:**
   - The molecular weight of water (H₂O) can be calculated by summing the weights of its constituent atoms:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of H₂O} = (2 \times \text{atomic weight of H}) + (\text{atomic weight of O})
     \]
     \[
     = (2 \times 1) + 16 = 2 + 16 = 18 \text{ grams/mole}
     \]

4. **Weight of Hydrogen in Water:**
   - The contribution of hydrogen to the molecular weight of water comes from the two hydrogen atoms:
     \[
     \text{Weight of hydrogen in water} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ grams/mole}
     \]

5. **Percentage of Hydrogen in Water:**
   - To find the percentage of hydrogen in water, use the formula for percentage:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of hydrogen} = \left(\frac{\text{Weight of hydrogen in water}}{\text{Molecular weight of water}}\right) \times 100
     \]
     \[
     = \left(\frac{2}{18}\right) \times 100 \approx 11.11\%

1000 ml of a 0.125 M solution of potassium carbonate is prepared. How many grams of potassium carbonate are in the solution?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Molarity**: 
   - Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. 
   - In this problem, the molarity of the potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃) solution is 0.125 M, meaning there are 0.125 moles of K₂CO₃ in 1 liter (1000 ml) of the solution.

2. **Volume of the Solution**:
   - Since we have exactly 1000 ml of the solution, it is equivalent to 1 liter.

3. **Calculating Moles of Potassium Carbonate**:
   - Using the definition of molarity:
     \[
     \text{Moles of K₂CO₃} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume in liters} = 0.125 \, \text{moles/liter} \times 1 \, \text{liter} = 0.125 \, \text{moles}
     \]

4. **Molar Mass of Potassium Carbonate (K₂CO₃)**:
   - To find the mass of potassium carbonate, we need its molar mass.
   - Potassium (K) has an atomic mass of approximately 39.1 g/mol.
     - Thus, 2 Potassium atoms: \( 2 \times 39.1 = 78.2 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.0 g/mol.
   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.0 g/mol.
     - Thus, 3 Oxygen atoms: \( 3 \times 16.0 = 48.0 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Therefore, the molar mass of K₂CO₃ is:
     \[
     78.2 \, \text{g/mol} + 12.0 \, \text{g/mol} + 48.0 \, \text{g/mol} = 138.2 \, \text{g/mol}

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Moles of Sulfuric Acid:**

   - Sulfuric acid (\(\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4\)) is given as a 0.5 molar solution.
   - Molarity (\(M\)) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution. Therefore, the moles of sulfuric acid can be calculated as:

     \[

2. **Calculate Moles of Sodium Hydroxide:**

   - Sodium hydroxide (\(\text{NaOH}\)) added is 10 grams.
   - Molar mass of \(\text{NaOH}\) = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol.
   - Moles of \(\text{NaOH}\):

     \[
     \text{Moles of NaOH} = \frac{10 \, \text{g}}{40 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.25 \, \text{moles}

3. **Neutralization Reaction:**

   The balanced chemical reaction between sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide is:

   \[
   \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2 \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}

\[ \text{C} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 \]

From the balanced equation, one molecule of carbon (C) reacts with one molecule of oxygen gas (O₂) to produce one molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂). According to the law of conservation of mass and stoichiometry, the mass ratios in this reaction need to be maintained.

#### Step 1: Molar Masses

Let's calculate the molar masses of the reactants:
- Molar mass of Carbon (C): 12 g/mol
- Molar mass of Oxygen (O₂): 32 g/mol

#### Step 2: Stoichiometry of the Reaction

The stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that:
- 12 grams of Carbon reacts with 32 grams of Oxygen gas (O₂) to form 44 grams of Carbon Dioxide.

#### Step 3: Proportion for 3 grams of Oxygen

We are given that 3 grams of oxygen are available for the reaction. We need to find out how many grams of carbon will react with this amount of oxygen.

Create a proportion based on the stoichiometry:
\[ \frac{\text{12 g of C}}{\text{32 g of O}_2} = \frac{x \text{ g of C}}{3 \text{ g of O}_2} \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12 \times 3}{32} \]

#### Step 4: Calculation

\[ x = \frac{36}{32} = 1.125 \]

### Conclusion

1.125 grams of carbon will combine with 3 grams of oxygen to form carbon dioxide.

To determine the cross-sectional area of a wire using a screw gauge, the linear scale reading is 2 mm, the circular scale reading is 0.40 mm, with a total of 100 divisions on the circular scale, and the pitch of the device is 1 mm. Which mark on the circular scale coincides exactly with the linear scale?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Screw Gauge Measurement:**
   - A screw gauge measures dimensions by combining readings from a linear scale and a rotating circular scale.
   - The ""pitch"" is the distance the screw moves longitudinally with one complete turn of the circular scale. Here, the pitch is given as 1 mm.
   - The ""least count"" (LC) of a screw gauge is determined by dividing the pitch by the number of divisions on the circular scale.

2. **Determine the Least Count (LC):**
   - Total divisions on circular scale = 100.
   - Pitch = 1 mm.
   - Least Count (LC) = \(\frac{\text{Pitch}}{\text{Number of Divisions on Circular Scale}} = \frac{1 \text{ mm}}{100} = 0.01 \text{ mm}\).

3. **Calculate the Actual Measurement:**
   - Linear scale reading (LSR) = 2 mm.
   - Observed reading on the circular scale = 0.40 mm.
   - Actual reading on the circular scale can be calculated using the least count:
     \[
     \text{Circular Scale Reading (CSR)} = \text{Number of Divisions} \times \text{LC} = \text{CSR Value}
     \]
   - Here, CSR is given directly as 0.40 mm.

4. **Determine the Number of Divisions on the Circular Scale:**
   - Substituting for the above formula using CSR as 0.40 mm:
     \[
     0.40 \text{ mm} = \text{Number of Divisions} \times 0.01 \text{ mm}
     \]
   - Solving for the number of divisions:
     \[
     \text{Number of Divisions} = \frac{0.40 \text{ mm}}{0.01 \text{ mm/division}} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The 40th mark on the circular scale coincides exactly with the linear scale reading indicating"

On the same road, two objects having masses of 15 kg and 10 kg move towards each other in opposite directions with velocities of 3 m/s and 5 m/s respectively and collide, sticking together. What is the kinetic energy in joules of the second object before the collision?

### Step-by-Step Solution

To find the kinetic energy of the second object before the collision, we use the formula for kinetic energy:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

Where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the object,
- \( v \) is the velocity of the object.

Given for the second object:
- Mass (\( m \)) = 10 kg
- Velocity (\( v \)) = 5 m/s

Substitute these values into the kinetic energy formula:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \, \text{kg} \times (5 \, \text{m/s})^2
\]

Calculate the velocity squared:

\[
(5 \, \text{m/s})^2 = 25 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Now substitute back into the kinetic energy equation:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 25
\]

\[
KE = 5 \times 25
\]

\[
KE = 125 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy of the second object before the collision is 125 joules.

An object moved 10 meters forward in a straight path and then returned 4 meters along the same path. What is the difference between the distance traveled and the displacement in meters?

### Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of ""distance"" and ""displacement.""

1. **Distance** is a scalar quantity that refers to ""how much ground an object has covered"" during its motion. For this scenario:
   - The object moves 10 meters forward.
   - Then, it moves 4 meters back.
   - Therefore, the total distance traveled is: 
     \[
     10 \, \text{meters} + 4 \, \text{meters} = 14 \, \text{meters}
     \]

2. **Displacement** is a vector quantity that involves both direction and magnitude; it refers to ""how far out of place an object is"" from its starting point.
   - Initially, the object moves 10 meters forward.
   - Then, it returns 4 meters back. Thus, its net movement or displacement from the starting point is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{meters} - 4 \, \text{meters} = 6 \, \text{meters} \text{ forward}
     \]

3. **Difference between Distance and Displacement**:
   - Calculating the difference:
     \[
     \text{Distance} - \text{Displacement} = 14 \, \text{meters} - 6 \, \text{meters}

A 1 kg mass object was thrown straight upwards. It fell to the ground after 10 seconds. What will be the potential energy of the object at its maximum height?

## Solution:
To determine the potential energy of the object at its maximum height, we first need to find this maximum height. The problem provides us with the total time the object is in the air, which is 10 seconds.

### Step 1: Determine the time taken to reach maximum height
When an object is thrown upwards, it takes half the total time to reach the maximum height, and the other half to descend. Thus, the time to reach the maximum height is:
\[ t = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the initial velocity
Using the first equation of motion:
\[ v = u + at \]
where \( v \) is the final velocity at the maximum height (0 m/s), \( u \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration (here, \(-9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) due to gravity), and \( t \) is the time of 5 seconds.

Rearranging for initial velocity \( u \):
\[ 0 = u + (-9.8) \times 5 \]
\[ u = 9.8 \times 5 = 49 \, \text{m/s} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the maximum height
Using the second equation of motion:
\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]
where \( s \) is the maximum height, \( u \) is 49 m/s, \( a \) is \(-9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\), and \( t \) is 5 seconds.

Substituting the values:
\[ s = 49 \times 5 + \frac{1}{2} \times (-9.8) \times (5)^2 \]
\[ s = 245 - \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 25 \]
\[ s = 245 - 4.9 \times 25 \]
\[ s = 245 - 122.5 \]
\[ s = 122.5 \, \text{m} \]

A motor spends a total of 107 joules of energy to lift a 2 kg object to a height of 5 meters. How many joules of energy are wasted in the motor?

## Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we'll first calculate the amount of energy needed to lift a 2 kg object to a height of 5 meters, which is essentially the gravitational potential energy (GPE) gained by the object. This can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)} = mgh
\]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the object, which is 2 kg.
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
- \( h \) is the height, which is 5 meters.

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[
\text{GPE} = 2 \times 9.8 \times 5
\]

\[
\text{GPE} = 98 \, \text{joules}
\]

This means that 98 joules of energy are required to lift the object to the desired height.

The motor consumes a total of 107 joules of energy. The difference between the total energy consumed and the actual energy required for lifting indicates the amount of energy wasted, typically due to inefficiencies such as friction or heat.

The wasted energy can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Wasted Energy} = \text{Total Energy Used} - \text{Useful Energy}
\]

\[
\text{Wasted Energy} = 107 - 98
\]

\[
\text{Wasted Energy} = 9 \, \text{joules}
\]

Thus, the motor wastes 9 joules of energy.

A spherical ball with a diameter of 4 cm fits perfectly into a cylindrical container. What is the volume of the cylinder in cubic centimeters?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the volume of the cylinder that perfectly encloses the sphere, we need to understand the relationship between the sphere and the cylinder:

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - The ball is a sphere with a given diameter of 4 cm. Therefore, the radius of the sphere (and hence the ball) is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) cm.
   - Since the ball fits perfectly inside the cylinder, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the diameter of the cylinder. Therefore, the radius of the cylinder is also 2 cm.
   - The height of the cylinder is equal to the diameter of the sphere (because the sphere touches both the top and bottom of the cylinder). Thus, the height of the cylinder is 4 cm.

2. **Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder**:
   The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

   Substituting the known values:
   - Radius \( r = 2 \) cm
   - Height \( h = 4 \) cm

   \[
   V = \pi \times (2)^2 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   V = \pi \times 4 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   V = 16\pi
   \]

3. **Calculating the Numerical Value**:
   Using the approximate value of \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
   \[
   V \approx 16 \times 3.1416 = 50.2656
   \]

Thus, the volume of the cylinder is approximately 50.27 cubic centimeters.

A coin is tossed 2000 times and it comes up heads 1030 times. What is the probability of getting tails when the coin is tossed once?

## Solution
To find the probability of getting tails in a single toss, we'll first need to determine the total number of tails obtained in the 2000 tosses and then use that to find the probability.

1. **Determine the Number of Tails:**
   - Total number of tosses = 2000
   - Number of heads obtained = 1030
   
   Therefore, the number of tails is:
   \[
   \text{Number of tails} = \text{Total tosses} - \text{Number of heads} = 2000 - 1030 = 970
   \]

2. **Calculate the Probability of Tails:**
   - The probability of an event is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Probability of an event} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
   \]
   
   In this case, the probability of getting tails is:
   \[
   P(\text{Tails}) = \frac{\text{Number of tails}}{\text{Total number of tosses}} = \frac{970}{2000}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   - Divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 970 and 2000 is 10.
   \[
   \frac{970}{2000} = \frac{970 \div 10}{2000 \div 10} = \frac{97}{200}
   \]

Therefore, the probability of getting tails in a single coin toss is \(\frac{97}{200}\).

The problem in English: If the difference in circumference between two wheels is 70 cm, what is the difference in their diameters in cm?

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the diameter and the circumference of a circle. The formula for the circumference \( C \) of a circle with diameter \( D \) is given by:

\[ C = \pi D \]

Given:

- The difference in circumferences of the two wheels, \( C_1 - C_2 = 70 \) cm.

From the formula for circumference, we have:

\[ C_1 = \pi D_1 \]
\[ C_2 = \pi D_2 \]

Substituting into the difference of circumferences:

\[ \pi D_1 - \pi D_2 = 70 \]

Factor out \( \pi \):

\[ \pi (D_1 - D_2) = 70 \]

To find the difference in diameters, \( D_1 - D_2 \), divide both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ D_1 - D_2 = \frac{70}{\pi} \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[ D_1 - D_2 = \frac{70}{3.1416} \]
\[ D_1 - D_2 \approx 22.28 \]

Thus, the difference in their diameters is approximately 22.28 cm.

To produce 56 grams of calcium oxide, how many grams of oxygen are needed?

## Detailed Solution:
To solve this problem, we must first understand the chemical reaction involved in the formation of calcium oxide (CaO). The balanced chemical equation for the formation of calcium oxide from calcium and oxygen is:

\[ \text{2Ca} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{2CaO} \]

This equation shows that two moles of calcium react with one mole of oxygen to produce two moles of calcium oxide.

### Step 1: Determine the Molar Masses
- The molar mass of calcium (Ca) is approximately 40 grams/mole.
- The molar mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 grams/mole.
- Therefore, the molar mass of dioxygen (O₂) is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) grams/mole.
- The molar mass of calcium oxide (CaO) is \(40 + 16 = 56\) grams/mole.

### Step 2: Calculate Moles of Calcium Oxide
Given that we need to produce 56 grams of calcium oxide, we first calculate the number of moles of CaO:

\[ \text{Moles of CaO} = \frac{\text{Mass of CaO}}{\text{Molar mass of CaO}} = \frac{56 \text{ grams}}{56 \text{ grams/mole}} = 1 \text{ mole} \]

### Step 3: Relate Moles of Oxygen to Moles of Calcium Oxide
The balanced equation indicates that 1 mole of \(\text{O}_2\) will react with calcium to produce 2 moles of calcium oxide. Hence, for 1 mole of CaO, 0.5 moles of \(\text{O}_2\) are required.

### Step 4: Calculate Mass of Oxygen
Next, we find out how many grams of oxygen this corresponds to by using the molar mass of \(\text{O}_2\):

\[ \text{Mass of } \text{O}_2 = \text{Moles of } \text{O}_2 \times \text{Molar mass of } \text{O}_2 = 0.5 \text{ moles} \times 32 \text{ grams/mole} = 16 \text{ grams} \]

A freely falling object travels a distance of 25 meters in 5 seconds. How much further distance will the object travel in the 6th second?

## Solution
Given the scenario, we need to understand the concept of an object freely falling under gravity. For a body falling freely under the influence of gravity (ignoring air resistance), the distance it travels in a given time period is determined by the equation of motion:

\[ s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]

where:
- \( s \) is the distance traveled,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on Earth),
- \( t \) is the time in seconds.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate Total Distance in 5 Seconds:**

   Using the information that the object travels 25 meters in 5 seconds, we set up the equation:
   
   \[ s_5 = \frac{1}{2} g (5^2) = 25 \]

   Solving for \( g \), we substitute:
   
   \[ 25 = \frac{1}{2} g \times 25 \]

   \[ 25 = \frac{25g}{2} \]

   \[ 50 = 25g \]

   \[ g = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]

2. **Calculate Total Distance in 6 Seconds:**

   To find out how much distance the object covers in total by the 6th second:
   
   \[ s_6 = \frac{1}{2} g (6^2) \]

   Substitute \( g = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):
   
   \[ s_6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 36 \]

   \[ s_6 = 36 \, \text{meters} \]

3. **Find the Distance Traveled in the 6th Second:**

   The distance traveled during the 6th second is the total distance up to 6 seconds minus the total distance up to 5 seconds:

   \[ \text{Distance in 6th second} = s_6 - s_5 = 36 - 25 \]

   \[ = 11 \, \text{meters} \]

To produce 56 grams of calcium oxide, how many moles of oxygen are required?

## Step 2: Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we need to consider the chemical reaction involved in forming calcium oxide (CaO) from its elements. The reaction can be represented as follows:

\[ \text{2Ca} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{2CaO} \]

This balanced chemical equation tells us that 2 moles of calcium (Ca) react with 1 mole of oxygen (O\(_2\)) to produce 2 moles of calcium oxide (CaO).

### Step 2.1: Calculate the molar mass of calcium oxide (CaO)

The molar mass of a compound can be determined by adding up the atomic masses of its constituent elements.

- Atomic mass of Calcium (Ca) = 40.08 g/mol
- Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol

So, the molar mass of calcium oxide (CaO) is:

\[ Molar \, mass \, of \, CaO = 40.08 \, \text{g/mol} (Ca) + 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} (O) = 56.08 \, \text{g/mol} \]

### Step 2.2: Calculate the moles of calcium oxide produced

We are given that 56 grams of calcium oxide are produced. Using the molar mass of CaO calculated above, we can find the moles of CaO:

\[ \text{Moles of CaO} = \frac{\text{mass of CaO}}{\text{molar mass of CaO}} \]

\[ \text{Moles of CaO} = \frac{56 \, \text{g}}{56.08 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.9986 \, \text{mol} \]

### Step 2.3: Calculate the moles of oxygen required

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of CaO are produced with 1 mole of O\(_2\). Thus, the moles of O\(_2\) required are half the moles of CaO produced:

\[ \text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{0.9986 \, \text{mol CaO}}{2"

The main scale reading is 14 mm, the Vernier constant is 0.1 mm, and the Vernier reading is 3. What is the total reading in mm?

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to understand how to calculate the total reading using a Vernier caliper. A Vernier caliper is a precision instrument that has two scales—the main scale and the Vernier scale. Here's how to calculate the total reading:

1. **Main Scale Reading:** This is directly given as 14 mm.

2. **Vernier Constant and Vernier Scale Reading:**
   - The Vernier constant is 0.1 mm. This means each division on the Vernier scale represents 0.1 mm.
   - The Vernier reading is given as 3. This means the 3rd division on the Vernier scale aligns with a division on the main scale.

3. **Calculating the Vernier Contribution:**
   - The Vernier contribution to the measurement can be calculated by multiplying the Vernier constant by the Vernier scale reading:
   \[
   \text{Vernier Contribution} = (\text{Vernier Reading}) \times (\text{Vernier Constant}) = 3 \times 0.1 \, \text{mm} = 0.3 \, \text{mm}

     \]
     \[
     \text{Vernier Scale Division} = \frac{15}{16} \, \text{mm}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Vernier Constant:**

     \[
     \text{Vernier Constant} = \text{Main Scale Division} - \text{Vernier Scale Division}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Vernier Constant} = 1 - \frac{15}{16}

In Bipasha's class, there are 250 (in octal) students. Each student has 11 (in hexadecimal) books. According to our number system, how many total books do they have?

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we first need to convert the numbers given in octal and hexadecimal to decimal (base 10), so we can perform a straightforward multiplication to find the total number of books.

1. **Convert 250 from Octal to Decimal:**

   The number 250 in octal is interpreted as follows:
   - \(250_{8}\) = \(2 \times 8^2 + 5 \times 8^1 + 0 \times 8^0\)
   - Simplifying, we have:
     - \(2 \times 64 = 128\)
     - \(5 \times 8 = 40\)
     - \(0 \times 1 = 0\)
   - Adding them up: \(128 + 40 + 0 = 168\)

   Therefore, 250 in octal is equal to 168 in decimal.

2. **Convert 11 from Hexadecimal to Decimal:**

   The number 11 in hexadecimal is interpreted as follows:
   - \(11_{16}\) = \(1 \times 16^1 + 1 \times 16^0\)
   - Simplifying, we have:
     - \(1 \times 16 = 16\)
     - \(1 \times 1 = 1\)
   - Adding them up: \(16 + 1 = 17\)

   Therefore, 11 in hexadecimal is equal to 17 in decimal.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Books:**

   Now, we multiply the number of students by the number of books each student has, both in decimal:

   \[
   168 \times 17 = 2856
   \]

Therefore, the total number of books that all the students have is 2856.

If an object is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 9.8 meters per second, how high will it rise?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum height the object reaches when it is thrown upwards with a given initial velocity. We will use the following kinematic equation for motion under gravity:

\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \]

Where:
- \( v \) is the final velocity (m/s) at the maximum height (which is 0 m/s because the object momentarily comes to rest at its highest point),
- \( u \) is the initial velocity (9.8 m/s, as given),
- \( a \) is the acceleration due to gravity (since the object is moving upwards against gravity, this is \(-9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)),
- \( s \) is the displacement, which in this case is the maximum height.

Let's substitute the known values into the equation:

\[ 0 = (9.8)^2 + 2 \times (-9.8) \times s \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ 0 = 96.04 - 19.6s \]

By solving for \( s \), we get:

\[ 19.6s = 96.04 \]

\[ s = \frac{96.04}{19.6} \]

\[ s = 4.9 \]

To solve this problem, we use the kinematic equation for motion under gravity, where an object is dropped from a certain height. The equation we need to use is:

\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2gh \]

where:
- \( v \) is the final velocity,
- \( u \) is the initial velocity (which is 0, since the object is dropped),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) on Earth),
- \( h \) is the height from which the object is dropped.

1. **Initial Values:**
   - Initial velocity, \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \) (since the object is dropped)
   - Height, \( h = 50 \, \text{m} \)
   - Gravitational acceleration, \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

A Vernier scale is used with a meter scale where 10 divisions are equal to 9 mm. What is the smallest measurement in millimeters that can be measured using this Vernier scale?

## Solution:

To find the smallest measurement that can be measured (known as the Vernier scale's least count), we need to understand the basic concept of a Vernier scale.

### Step 1: Understand the Vernier Scale

The Vernier scale enhances measurement precision by allowing measurements smaller than the smallest division of the main scale. 

We are given:
- On the Vernier scale, 10 divisions equal 9 mm.

### Step 2: Calculate the Value of One Vernier Scale Division

To find the value of one division on the Vernier scale:
\[
\text{Value of one Vernier division} = \frac{9 \text{ mm}}{10} = 0.9 \text{ mm}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Value of One Main Scale Division

A typical meter scale (main scale) is marked in millimeters.
\[
\text{Value of one main scale division} = 1 \text{ mm}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Least Count of the Vernier Scale

The least count of the Vernier scale is the smallest difference that can be measured between one main scale division and one Vernier scale division. This is given by:
\[
\text{Least count} = \text{Value of one main scale division} - \text{Value of one Vernier division} = 1 \text{ mm} - 0.9 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ mm}
\]

Hence, using this Vernier scale, the smallest measurement that can theoretically be made is 0.1 mm.

In Bipasha's class, there are 13 students in octal numbering. Each has 56 pens in hexadecimal numbering. What is the total number of pens they all have together in the decimal numbering system?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Convert the number of students from octal to decimal:**

   The number of students is given as ""13"" in octal. To convert from octal to decimal, we can use the following conversion method:

   \[
   13_{(8)} = 1 \times 8^1 + 3 \times 8^0
   \]

   Calculating the above:

   \[
   1 \times 8^1 = 8
   \]
   \[
   3 \times 8^0 = 3
   \]

   Adding these values gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   So, there are 11 students in decimal.

2. **Convert the number of pens from hexadecimal to decimal:**

   The number of pens is given as ""56"" in hexadecimal. To convert from hexadecimal to decimal, we use the following conversion method:

   \[
   56_{(16)} = 5 \times 16^1 + 6 \times 16^0
   \]

   Calculating the above:

   \[
   5 \times 16^1 = 80
   \]
   \[
   6 \times 16^0 = 6
   \]

   Adding these values gives:

   \[
   80 + 6 = 86
   \]

   So, each student has 86 pens in decimal.

3. **Calculate the total number of pens:**

   To find the total number of pens, multiply the number of students by the number of pens each student has:

   \[
   11 \times 86
   \]

   Performing this multiplication:

   \[
   11 \times 86 = 946
   \]

   Therefore, the total number of pens is 946.

**Conclusion:**

The total number of pens all the students have together in decimal is 946.

From the tickets numbered consecutively from 1 to 10, if one ticket is randomly selected, what is the probability that the ticket is a multiple of 2 or 3?

## Detailed Solution:

To find the probability that a randomly selected ticket is a multiple of 2 or 3, we need to consider the total possible outcomes (total tickets) and the favorable outcomes (tickets that are multiples of 2 or 3).

### Step 1: Total Number of Tickets
The tickets are numbered from 1 to 10, so the total number of tickets is 10.

### Step 2: Find Multiples of 2
The multiples of 2 from 1 to 10 are:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

This gives us a total of 5 multiples of 2.

### Step 3: Find Multiples of 3
The multiples of 3 from 1 to 10 are:
3, 6, 9.

This gives us a total of 3 multiples of 3.

### Step 4: Consider Multiples of Both 2 and 3 (i.e., LCM of 2 and 3)
The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3 is 6. Therefore, the multiples of both 2 and 3 (i.e., multiples of 6) are:
6.

There is 1 number (6) that is a multiple of both 2 and 3.

### Step 5: Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
To find the total number of favorable outcomes where the number is a multiple of either 2 or 3, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle:

Number of favorable outcomes = (Number of multiples of 2) + (Number of multiples of 3) - (Number of multiples of both 2 and 3).

Substituting the values we found:
Number of favorable outcomes = 5 (multiples of 2) + 3 (multiples of 3) - 1 (multiples of both 2 and 3) = 7.

### Step 6: Calculate the Probability
Probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes).

Substituting the numbers:
Probability = 7 / 10.

Therefore, the probability that the selected ticket is a multiple of 2 or"

   A 1 kg mass gun fires a bullet weighing 5 grams, causing the gun to recoil at a velocity of 2 m/s. What is the final velocity of the bullet in m/s?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we apply the principle of conservation of momentum. The conservation of momentum states that in the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a closed system before and after an event is the same.

   **Given:**
   - Mass of the gun (\(m_{\text{gun}}\)): 1 kg
   - Velocity of the gun after firing (\(v_{\text{gun}}\)): -2 m/s (negative because it recoils in the opposite direction)
   - Mass of the bullet (\(m_{\text{bullet}}\)): 5 grams = 0.005 kg

   Since initially, both the gun and the bullet are at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is 0.

   **Final momentum of the system:**
   The system consists of the gun and the bullet. After the gun fires, the bullet and the gun move in opposite directions due to recoil.

   Let's denote the final velocity of the bullet as \(v_{\text{bullet}}\).

   The total momentum of the system after the bullet is fired is:
   \[
   m_{\text{gun}} \times v_{\text{gun}} + m_{\text{bullet}} \times v_{\text{bullet}}
   \]

   According to the conservation of momentum:
   \[
   0 = (1 \, \text{kg}) \times (-2 \, \text{m/s}) + (0.005 \, \text{kg}) \times v_{\text{bullet}}
   \]

   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   0 = -2 + 0.005 \times v_{\text{bullet}}
   \]

   Rearranging to solve for \(v_{\text{bullet}}\):
   \[
   0.005 \times v_{\text{bullet}} = 2
   \]

   Dividing both sides by 0.005:
   \[
   v_{\text{bullet}} = \frac{2}{0.005} = 400
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   The final velocity of the bullet is 400 m/s.

A mountain located at a distance of 500 kilometers from a point subtends an angle of 5 degrees. What is the height of the mountain in meters?

### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry, specifically the tangent of the angle. We will assume that the observer's eye level at the point is at the same horizontal level as the base of the mountain. The angle given is the angle of elevation from the observer's point to the top of the mountain.

**Let's denote:**
- \( d = 500 \) kilometers, the distance from the observer to the base of the mountain.
- \( \theta = 5 \) degrees, the angle of elevation.
- \( h \) is the height of the mountain, which we need to find.

**Using the tangent function:**
\[ 
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjacent side}} 
\]
In our case:
\[ 
\tan(5^\circ) = \frac{h}{500,000} 
\]
The distance is converted to meters (1 km = 1000 meters), so 500 km = 500,000 meters.

**Solving for \( h \):**
\[ 
h = 500,000 \times \tan(5^\circ) 
\]

**Calculate \( \tan(5^\circ) \):**
Using a calculator, we find:
\[ 
\tan(5^\circ) \approx 0.08749 
\]

**Substitute back to find \( h \):**
\[ 
h = 500,000 \times 0.08749 \approx 43,745 
\]

Thus, the height of the mountain is approximately 43,745 meters.

**Conclusion:**
By using trigonometry, specifically the tangent of an angle, we were able to determine the height of the mountain based on its angular elevation from a specific distance.

What is the molecular weight of 15 moles of chlorine?

## Solution:
To find the molecular weight of 15 moles of chlorine, we should begin by identifying the molecular weight of a single mole of chlorine molecules.

1. **Identify the molecular formula for chlorine gas:**
   - Chlorine gas is diatomic, meaning it exists as a molecule with two chlorine atoms, represented as \(\text{Cl}_2\).

2. **Find the atomic weight of chlorine:**
   - The atomic weight of a single chlorine atom (Cl) is approximately 35.5 amu (atomic mass units).

3. **Calculate the molecular weight of \(\text{Cl}_2\):**
   - Since each chlorine molecule consists of two chlorine atoms:
   \[
   \text{Molecular weight of } \text{Cl}_2 = 2 \times 35.5 = 71 \text{ amu}
   \]

4. **Calculate the molecular weight of 15 moles of chlorine:**
   - The molecular weight of 1 mole of \(\text{Cl}_2\) is 71 grams (since 1 mole of a substance is its molecular weight in grams).
   - Therefore, the molecular weight of 15 moles of \(\text{Cl}_2\) would be:

The problem states: ""10 grams of sodium hydroxide reacted with 5 grams of carbon dioxide. How many grams of sodium hydroxide will remain after the reaction?""

## Solution:

The chemical reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) can be represented as:

\[ 2 \text{NaOH} + \text{CO}_2 \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

### Step 1: Determine the molar masses

- Molar mass of NaOH = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol
- Molar mass of CO₂ = 12 (C) + 2*16 (O) = 44 g/mol

### Step 2: Determine the stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation

From the balanced reaction, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO₂. Therefore:

- 2 moles of NaOH (80 g, because 2 * 40 g/mol) react with 1 mole of CO₂ (44 g)

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of NaOH and CO₂ available

We are given:

- 10 grams of NaOH
- 5 grams of CO₂

### Step 4: Find the limiting reagent

1. Convert the given mass of NaOH to moles:
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ g NaOH}}{40 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.25 \text{ mol NaOH}
   \]

2. Convert the given mass of CO₂ to moles:
   \[
   \frac{5 \text{ g CO}_2}{44 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.1136 \text{ mol CO}_2
   \]

3. Use the stoichiometry to determine how much NaOH is needed for 0.1136 mol CO₂:
   \[
   0.1136 \text{ mol CO}_2 \times 2 \text{ mol NaOH/mol CO}_2 = 0.2272 \text{ mol NaOH}

Since we have 0.25 mol NaOH available but only need 0.2272 mol to react with all the CO₂, NaOH is in excess.

A circle has a radius of 5 cm, and an arc subtends an angle of 60 degrees at the center. What is the approximate length of the arc in centimeters?

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Circumference of the Circle**:
   The formula for the circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by:
   \[
   C = 2 \pi r
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. Here, the radius \(r\) is 5 cm. Substituting the value, we get:
   \[
   C = 2 \pi \times 5 = 10 \pi \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Arc Length Formula**:
   The length \(L\) of an arc subtending an angle \(\theta\) at the center of a circle with radius \(r\) is calculated using:
   \[
   L = \frac{\theta}{360} \times C
   \]
   Since the arc subtends an angle \(\theta = 60\) degrees, we use this in our formula. We have already calculated \(C = 10 \pi\), so:
   \[
   L = \frac{60}{360} \times 10 \pi = \frac{1}{6} \times 10 \pi
   \]

3. **Calculate Arc Length**:
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   L = \frac{10 \pi}{6} = \frac{5 \pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Approximating \(\pi\)**:
   Assuming \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
   \[
   L \approx \frac{5 \times 3.1416}{3} = \frac{15.708}{3} \approx 5.236 \text{ cm}

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To find the area of a square when the diagonal is given, we need to understand the relationship between the side length of the square and its diagonal. For a square:

   - Let the side length of the square be \( s \).

   - According to the properties of a square, the diagonal \( d \) is related to the side length \( s \) by the formula:
     \[
     d = s\sqrt{2}
     \]

   Given that the diagonal \( d = \sqrt{2} \) cm, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   s\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}
   \]

   To find \( s \), divide both sides by \( \sqrt{2} \):
   \[
   s = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 1
   \]

   Now, knowing \( s = 1 \) cm, we can find the area \( A \) of the square using the formula:
   \[
   A = s^2

   Substituting \( s = 1 \) cm:
   \[
   A = (1)^2 = 1 \text{ square cm}

## Solution

To determine the displacement, we need to understand the geometric scenario. 

1. **Definition of Displacement**: 
   Displacement is the straight-line distance between the initial and final positions of an object. It is a vector quantity and has both magnitude and direction.

2. **Definition of Circumference**:
   The circumference of a circle is given by the formula \( C = 2\pi r \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

3. **Given**:
   - Radius (\( r \)) = 10 meters.

4. **Calculate the Circumference**:
   \[
   C = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \, \text{meters}
   \]

5. **Part of the Circumference Traversed**:
   - One-fourth of the circumference is traversed, which means:
   \[
   \text{Traversed arc length} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20\pi = 5\pi \, \text{meters}
   \]

6. **Geometry of the Situation**:
   - When one-fourth of the circumference of a circle is traversed, the arc corresponds to a 90-degree sector (or a quarter of a circle). 

7. **Displacement Calculation**:
   - The displacement is the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points of this arc, which is the hypotenuse of the right-angled isosceles triangle formed by the radii connecting the center to these points.
   - In such a triangle:
     - Both legs (radii) are equal to the radius of the circle, 10 meters.
     - The angle between these radii is 90 degrees.

8. **Using Pythagoras' Theorem**:

A wheel covers a distance of 4 km in 70 rotations. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the relationship between distance traveled, circumference, and number of rotations:**
   - The wheel makes 70 rotations to travel 4 km.
   - The distance traveled by the wheel is the circumference of the wheel multiplied by the number of rotations.
   - So, if \( C \) is the circumference of the wheel, the equation can be written as:
     \[
     70 \times C = 4 \text{ km}
     \]
   
2. **Convert the units for consistency:**
   - Convert 4 km into meters to match the unit we need for the diameter, which is in meters.
   - \( 4 \text{ km} = 4000 \text{ meters} \).

3. **Solve for the circumference of the wheel:**
   \[
   C = \frac{4000 \text{ meters}}{70}
   \]
   - Perform the division:
   \[
   C \approx 57.14 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Use the relationship between the circumference and the diameter:**
   - The circumference of a circle (or wheel) is given by the formula \( C = \pi \times d \), where \( d \) is the diameter.
   - Rearrange this formula to solve for \( d \):
   \[
   d = \frac{C}{\pi}
   \]
   - Substitute the value of \( C \) we found:
   \[
   d = \frac{57.14}{\pi}

   - Use \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
   \[
   d \approx \frac{57.14}{3.14159} \approx 18.19 \text{ meters}

Using a flawless slide calipers to measure the length of a rod, the main scale reading is found to be 5 mm and the vernier coincidence is 16. The smallest division of the main scale is 0.5 mm, and 19 divisions of the main scale equal 20 divisions of the vernier scale. What is the vernier constant in mm?

### Solution:

To find the vernier constant, we first need to understand the relationship between the main scale and vernier scale. The vernier constant, often called the least count, is the smallest length that can be measured accurately with this instrument. It's given by the difference in lengths between one division of the main scale and one division of the vernier scale.

1. **Determine the length of one main scale division:**
   - Given that the smallest division on the main scale is 0.5 mm.

2. **Length of one vernier scale division:**
   - According to the problem, 19 divisions on the main scale equal 20 divisions on the vernier scale.
   - Therefore, the length of 19 main scale divisions = 19 × 0.5 mm = 9.5 mm.
   - These 19 main scale divisions correspond to 20 vernier scale divisions.

3. **Calculate the length of one vernier scale division:**
   - Since 9.5 mm is spread over 20 vernier scale divisions, the length of one vernier division = 9.5 mm / 20.

4. **Calculate the vernier constant (least count):**
   - The least count is the difference between the length of one main scale division and one vernier scale division.
   - Vernier constant = Length of one main scale division - Length of one vernier scale division
   - = 0.5 mm - (9.5 mm / 20)
   - = 0.5 mm - 0.475 mm
   - = 0.025 mm

Thus, the vernier constant of the slide calipers is 0.025 mm.

A cow is tied with a rope so that it can graze on a circular field of area 25 square meters. What is the diameter of the field in meters?

## Solution:
To find the diameter of the circular field, we need to use the formula for the area of a circle:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
Where:
- \( A \) is the area of the circle.
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle.
- \( \pi \) is approximately 3.14159.

Given that the area \( A = 25 \) square meters, we substitute this into the formula:
\[
25 = \pi r^2
\]

To solve for \( r^2 \), divide both sides by \( \pi \):
\[
r^2 = \frac{25}{\pi}
\]

Now, solve for \( r \) by taking the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{25}{\pi}}
\]

We will approximate \( \pi \) as 3.14159 for calculation:
\[
r \approx \sqrt{\frac{25}{3.14159}}
\]

Calculate \( \frac{25}{3.14159} \):

   - ""What is the molecular weight of 2 moles of copper sulfate?""

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**
   To find the molecular weight of 2 moles of copper sulfate (CuSO₄), we first need to determine the molecular weight of a single mole of copper sulfate.

   - **Atomic weights of the elements involved:**
     - Copper (Cu): 63.55 amu (atomic mass units)
     - Sulfur (S): 32.07 amu
     - Oxygen (O): 16.00 amu

   - **Molecular formula for copper sulfate: CuSO₄**
     - The molecular weight of CuSO₄ is calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms present in the formula.
       \[
       \text{Molecular weight of CuSO}_{4} = \text{Atomic weight of Cu} + \text{Atomic weight of S} + 4 \times \text{Atomic weight of O}
       \]
     - Substitute in the known atomic weights:
       \[
       = 63.55 + 32.07 + 4 \times 16.00
       \]
     - Calculate the sum:
       \[
       = 63.55 + 32.07 + 64.00
       \]
       \[
       = 159.62 \, \text{amu}
       \]

   - **Molecular weight of 2 moles of copper sulfate:**
     - The molecular weight calculated above is for 1 mole of CuSO₄. Since we are asked for 2 moles, we multiply the weight of 1 mole by 2.
       \[
       \text{Molecular weight of 2 moles of CuSO}_{4} = 2 \times 159.62
       \]
     - Calculate the result:
       \[
       = 319.24 \, \text{amu}
       \]

""What is the probability of selecting a perfect square number when a number is chosen randomly from the first one hundred natural numbers?""

## Solution
To find the probability, we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the Total Outcomes**: 
   - The problem states that we are selecting a number from the first one hundred natural numbers. 
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 100.

2. **Identify the Favorable Outcomes**:
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. 
   - We need to find all the perfect squares from 1 to 100 (since we are dealing with the first 100 natural numbers).
   - The perfect squares within this range are: 
     \[
     1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 5^2 = 25, 
     \]
     \[
     6^2 = 36, \quad 7^2 = 49, \quad 8^2 = 64, \quad 9^2 = 81, \quad 10^2 = 100
     \]
   - These numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100) are the perfect squares within the first 100 natural numbers.

3. **Count the Number of Favorable Outcomes**:
   - There are a total of 10 perfect square numbers.

4. **Calculate the Probability**:
   - The probability of an event is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability \( P \) of selecting a perfect square number is:
     \[
     P = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}} = \frac{10}{100} = \frac{1}{10}
     \]

Thus, the probability of selecting a perfect square number from the first 100 natural numbers is \( \frac{1}{10} \).

Among some students, 60 like cricket, 40 like football, and 25 like both games. How many students like at least one of the games?

### Detailed Solution:

To find out how many students like at least one of the games, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion from set theory. This principle helps in finding the union of two sets when there is an overlap between them.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the set of students who like cricket.
- \( F \) as the set of students who like football.

From the problem:
- \(|C| = 60\) (the number of students who like cricket),
- \(|F| = 40\) (the number of students who like football),
- \(|C \cap F| = 25\) (the number of students who like both cricket and football).

We need to find \(|C \cup F|\), the number of students who like at least one of the games. According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the formula is:

\[
|C \cup F| = |C| + |F| - |C \cap F|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|C \cup F| = 60 + 40 - 25
\]
\[
|C \cup F| = 75
\]

### Conclusion:
Thus, the number of students who like at least one of the two games is 75.

A boy weighing 40 kg climbs up to the roof in 15 seconds using stairs. The staircase has 20 steps, and each step has a height of 16 cm. What is the power output of the boy in watts?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the power generated by the boy as he climbs the stairs.
   - Power is defined as the rate at which work is done, which can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work done}}{\text{Time taken}}
     \]

2. **Find the Total Height Climbed:**
   - Each step has a height of 16 cm.
   - Number of steps = 20
   - Total height \( h \) climbed = number of steps \(\times\) height per step.
   - Convert the height from centimeters to meters for SI unit consistency:
     \[
     h = 20 \times 16 = 320 \, \text{cm} = 3.2 \, \text{m}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Work Done:**
   - Work done is equal to the gravitational potential energy gained by the boy.
   - Work done \( W = \text{Weight} \times \text{Height climbed} = m \times g \times h \)
   - Here, \( m = 40 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the boy), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity).
   - \[
   W = 40 \times 9.8 \times 3.2 
   \]
   - \[
   W = 40 \times 31.36 
   \]
   - \[
   W = 1254.4 \, \text{Joules}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Power Output:**
   - Given the time taken \( t = 15 \, \text{seconds} \).
   - Use the formula for power:
     \[
     \text{Power} = \frac{1254.4}{15} 
     \]
   - \[

""What is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle with a radius of 5 cm?""

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.

### Step 1: Understand the formula for circumference
The circumference \( C \) of a circle is calculated by the formula:
\[ C = 2\pi r \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

\[ C = 2\pi r = 2\pi \times 5 = 10\pi \]

### Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
The ratio \( R \) of the circumference to the diameter is:
\[ R = \frac{C}{d} = \frac{10\pi}{10} \]

Simplifying the ratio:
\[ R = \pi \]

A solid metallic sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 36 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resultant cylinder in square centimeters?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere
The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Here, \( r = 3 \) cm.

Substitute the value of \( r \):
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36\pi \, \text{cubic centimeters} \]

### Step 2: Understand Volume Conservation
When the sphere is melted to form the cylinder, its entire volume is conserved. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is the same as that of the sphere, which is \( 36\pi \) cubic centimeters.

### Step 3: Calculate the Radius of the Cylinder
The volume formula of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know \( h = 36 \) cm. We will use the volume calculated from the sphere to find the radius of the cylinder:
\[ 36\pi = \pi r^2 \times 36 \]

By cancelling \(\pi\) on both sides and simplifying:
\[ 36 = r^2 \times 36 \]

Divide both sides by 36:
\[ r^2 = 1 \]

Take the square root:
\[ r = 1 \, \text{cm} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Curved Surface Area of the Cylinder
The formula for the curved surface area \((CSA)\) of a cylinder is:
\[ CSA = 2\pi rh \]

Substitute the values of \( r \) and \( h \):
\[ CSA = 2\pi \times 1 \times 36 = 72\pi \]

\[ CSA \approx 72 \times 3.1416 = 226.1952 \, \text{square centimeters} \]

   The actual area is 200 square meters. However, the measured area was found to be 192 square meters. What is the percentage relative error?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To find the percentage relative error, we first need to calculate the absolute error and then use it to find the relative error percentage.

   - **Step 1: Calculate the Absolute Error**
     
     The absolute error is the difference between the actual value and the measured value.

     \[
     \text{Absolute Error} = \text{Actual Area} - \text{Measured Area} = 200\, \text{sq meters} - 192\, \text{sq meters} = 8\, \text{sq meters}
     \]

   - **Step 2: Calculate the Relative Error**

     The relative error is the absolute error divided by the actual value. It tells us how large the error is in relation to the true value.

     \[
     \text{Relative Error} = \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{\text{Actual Area}} = \frac{8}{200}
     \]

     Simplifying the fraction:

     \[
     \text{Relative Error} = \frac{8}{200} = \frac{1}{25} = 0.04
     \]

   - **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Relative Error**

     To find the percentage relative error, we multiply the relative error by 100.

     \[
     \text{Percentage Relative Error} = 0.04 \times 100 = 4\%
     \]

   The percentage relative error is 4%.

   ""In a test cricket match, what is the probability of it ending in a draw?""

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible outcomes of a test cricket match and then identify how many of those outcomes result in a draw. 

   Here are the possible outcomes for a test cricket match:
   - Team A wins.
   - Team B wins.
   - The match ends in a draw.

   Since the problem does not provide specific statistics or odds for these outcomes, we have to rely on general cricket knowledge and assumptions. Based on a typical test cricket scenario, let's assume the following probabilities as an estimate (without specific data):

   - Probability of Team A winning: \( P(A) \)
   - Probability of Team B winning: \( P(B) \)
   - Probability of a Draw: \( P(D) \)

   The sum of these probabilities should equal 1:
   \[ P(A) + P(B) + P(D) = 1 \]

   Empirical data over the years has shown that test matches have a significant chance of ending in a draw; though this has changed over time with more result-oriented pitches and play. Historically, the draw probability could have been nearly 30-40%.

   Assuming we have:
   - \( P(A) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.3 \)

   The equation becomes:
   \[ 0.3 + 0.3 + P(D) = 1 \]

   \[ P(D) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 \]

   Thus, assuming historical data, the probability of a test match ending in a draw can be estimated at 0.4 or 40%.

A spherical ball with a diameter of 2 cm fits perfectly inside a cylindrical box. What is the volume of the unoccupied part of the cylinder in cubic centimeters?

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a sphere with a diameter of 2 cm.
   - This sphere fits perfectly inside a cylindrical box, meaning the diameter of the sphere is equal to the diameter of the cylinder.
   - We need to find the volume of the space in the cylinder that is not occupied by the sphere.

2. **Determine the Radius:**
   - The diameter of the sphere (and thus the cylinder) is 2 cm.
   - Therefore, the radius of both the sphere and the cylinder is half of that, 1 cm.

3. **Height of the Cylinder:**
   - Since the sphere fits perfectly, the height of the cylinder must be equal to the diameter of the sphere.
   - So, the height of the cylinder is also 2 cm.

4. **Volume of the Cylinder:**
   - The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
   - Substituting the values, we have \( V = \pi (1)^2 (2) = 2\pi \) cubic centimeters.

5. **Volume of the Sphere:**
   - The formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (1)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \) cubic centimeters.

6. **Calculate Unoccupied Volume:**
   - The unoccupied volume is the volume of the cylinder minus the volume of the sphere.
   - Thus, it is \( 2\pi - \frac{4}{3}\pi = \frac{6\pi}{3} - \frac{4\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \).

What initial speed should an object be thrown vertically upwards so that it hits the ground after 10 seconds?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use kinematic equations related to motion under gravity. The primary equation used here is:

\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

where:
- \( s \) = displacement of the object (in meters)
- \( u \) = initial velocity (in meters per second)
- \( a \) = acceleration (in meters per second squared)
- \( t \) = time (in seconds)

In our case:
- The final position of the object \( s \) is 0 meters (since it returns to the ground).
- The acceleration \( a \) is \(-9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) (negative because gravity is acting downwards).
- The total time \( t \) is 10 seconds.

The equation can be rearranged to solve for the initial velocity \( u \):

Given that the object's journey consists of two phases: going up until it momentarily stops before coming back down. The time to reach the highest point is \( t_{\text{up}} = \frac{t}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) seconds.

For the upward journey, the time to reach the maximum height is 5 seconds. At the maximum height, final velocity \( v \) is 0 m/s. 

Using the equation for velocity:

\[ v = u + at \]

At the highest point, the final velocity \( v \) is 0, so we have:

\[ 0 = u - 9.8 \times 5 \]

Solving for \( u \):

\[ u = 9.8 \times 5 = 49 \, \text{m/s} \]

Thus, the object should be thrown with an initial velocity of 49 m/s upwards so that it hits the ground after 10 seconds.

   The problem is asking: ""What is the percentage composition of oxygen in water?""

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution**:

   To determine the percentage composition of oxygen in water, we need to analyze the chemical composition of a water molecule.

   A molecule of water (H₂O) consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. To find the percentage composition, we should consider the molar masses of these atoms:

   - The molar mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 gram/mole.
   - The molar mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 grams/mole.

   Therefore, the molar mass of a water molecule (H₂O) can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Molar mass of H₂O} = (2 \times 1 \text{ g/mole}) + (16 \text{ g/mole}) = 18 \text{ g/mole}
   \]

   Next, we find out the contribution of oxygen to this molar mass to calculate the percentage of oxygen in water.

   The mass of oxygen in one mole of water is 16 grams (since there is one oxygen atom per water molecule).

   The percentage of oxygen in water can be calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of Oxygen} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Oxygen in water}}{\text{Molar mass of water}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of Oxygen} = \left( \frac{16}{18} \right) \times 100 \approx 88.89\%

To make 4 grams of magnesium oxide, 2 grams of magnesium and 2 grams of oxygen gas were mixed in a suitable environment. However, the desired amount of product was not obtained. How many grams of oxygen reacted in the process?

### Solution:

1. **Understanding the Chemical Reaction:**

   We are dealing with the formation of magnesium oxide (\( \text{MgO} \)) from magnesium (\( \text{Mg} \)) and oxygen (\( \text{O}_2 \)). The chemical reaction can be written as:
   \[
   2 \, \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{MgO}
   \]

   From the reaction, it is clear that 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide.

2. **Molar Mass Calculations:**

   - **Molar mass of magnesium (Mg)** = 24 grams/mole
   - **Molar mass of oxygen gas \( (\text{O}_2) \)** = 32 grams/mole
   - **Molar mass of magnesium oxide (MgO)** = 40 grams/mole

3. **Expected Reaction:**

   To form magnesium oxide, 2 grams of magnesium would theoretically require:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ grams of } \text{O}_2}{2 \times 24 \text{ grams of Mg}} \times 2 \text{ grams of Mg} = \frac{32}{48} \times 2 = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ grams of } \text{O}_2
   \]

   Therefore, 2 grams of magnesium should ideally react with approximately 1.33 grams of oxygen to form magnesium oxide, yielding:
   \[
   \left(\frac{40 \text{ grams of } \text{MgO}}{24 \text{ grams of Mg}}\right) \times 2 \text{ grams of Mg} = \frac{40}{24} \times 2 \approx 3.33 \text{ grams of } \text{MgO}
   \]

   However, the reaction is not complete, as stated in the problem (""the desired amount of product was not obtained"").

A cow is tied with a rope in such a way that it can graze on a circular field of 25 square meters. What is the perimeter of the field?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the perimeter of the circular area that the cow can graze, given the area.

### Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Area and Radius

The formula for the area \( A \) of a circle is given by:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where:
- \( A \) is the area,
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle,
- \( \pi \) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

In this problem, the area \( A \) is given as 25 square meters.

### Step 2: Solve for the Radius

Substitute the given area into the area formula and solve for the radius \( r \):

\[ 25 = \pi r^2 \]

To find \( r^2 \), divide both sides of the equation by \( \pi \):

\[ r^2 = \frac{25}{\pi} \]

Now, take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

\[ r = \sqrt{\frac{25}{\pi}} \]

Calculate \( r \):

\[ r \approx \sqrt{\frac{25}{3.14159}} \]

\[ r \approx \sqrt{7.9577} \]

\[ r \approx 2.82 \text{ meters} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Perimeter (Circumference) 

Now that we have the radius, we can find the perimeter (circumference) of the circle, which is given by the formula:

\[ C = 2\pi r \]

Substitute the calculated radius into this formula:

\[ C = 2\pi \times 2.82 \]

Calculate \( C \):

\[ C \approx 2 \times 3.14159 \times 2.82 \]

\[ C \approx 17.72 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the field is approximately 17.72 meters.

Translated to English, it reads: ""0.1 mole of sulfuric acid equals how many grams of sulfuric acid?""

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To find out how many grams 0.1 mole of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) contains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Molecular Formula of Sulfuric Acid**: 
   - The molecular formula of sulfuric acid is H₂SO₄.

2. **Find the Molar Mass of Sulfuric Acid**:
   - The molar mass is calculated by summing up the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule of H₂SO₄.
   - The atomic masses (approximate) are: 
     - Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol
     - Sulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol
     - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

   - Calculate the molecular weight:
     - For Hydrogen: 2 * 1.01 = 2.02 g/mol
     - For Sulfur: 1 * 32.07 = 32.07 g/mol
     - For Oxygen: 4 * 16.00 = 64.00 g/mol

   - Sum these values to find the molar mass of H₂SO₄:
     \[
     2.02 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 98.09 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Mass from Moles**:
   - Use the relation: 
     \[
     \text{mass} = \text{moles} \times \text{molar mass}
     \]

   - Given that there are 0.1 moles of H₂SO₄, the mass can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{mass} = 0.1 \times 98.09 = 9.809 \, \text{grams}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Thus, 0.1 mole of sulfuric acid corresponds to 9.809 grams.

In a right-angled triangle, the perpendicular (height or leg) and the hypotenuse are 5 and 13 respectively. What is the base (other leg) of the triangle?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the base of a right-angled triangle given its perpendicular and hypotenuse, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

where \( c \) is the hypotenuse, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the other two sides of the triangle (the legs).

In this problem:
- The hypotenuse \( c = 13 \)
- The perpendicular \( a = 5 \)

We need to find the base \( b \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we plug in the known values:

\[ 5^2 + b^2 = 13^2 \]

First, calculate \( 5^2 \) and \( 13^2 \):

\[ 5^2 = 25 \]
\[ 13^2 = 169 \]

Substitute these values back into the equation:

\[ 25 + b^2 = 169 \]

To find \( b^2 \), subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

\[ b^2 = 169 - 25 \]
\[ b^2 = 144 \]

Now, solve for \( b \) by taking the square root of both sides:

\[ b = \sqrt{144} \]
\[ b = 12 \]

Therefore, the base of the triangle is 12.

17.75 grams of sodium sulfate is dissolved in 250 milliliters of solution. What is the molarity of the solution?

## Solution:

To find the molarity of the solution, we need to use the formula for molarity:

\[ \text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}} \]

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of sodium sulfate.

The chemical formula for sodium sulfate is \( \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4 \). First, we'll calculate its molar mass.

- The atomic mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 23.0 grams/mol.
- The atomic mass of sulfur (S) is approximately 32.1 grams/mol.
- The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.0 grams/mol.

Using the formula \( \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4 \):

\[ \text{Molar mass of Na}_2\text{SO}_4 = 2(23.0) + 32.1 + 4(16.0) \]

\[ = 46.0 + 32.1 + 64.0 \]

\[ = 142.1 \text{ grams/mol} \]

Now, we'll calculate the moles of sodium sulfate:

\[ \text{Moles of Na}_2\text{SO}_4 = \frac{\text{Given mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{17.75 \text{ grams}}{142.1 \text{ grams/mol}} \]

\[ = 0.1249 \text{ moles} \]

### Step 2: Convert the volume of the solution from milliliters to liters.

The volume of the solution is given as 250 milliliters. To convert this to liters:

\[ 250 \text{ mL} = 0.250 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the molarity of the solution.

Now, we use the formula for molarity:

\[ \text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{0.1249 \text{ moles}}{0.250 \text{ liters}} \]

\[ = 0.4996 \text{ M} \]

This is approximately 0.50 M when rounded to two significant figures.

### Solution
To find the probability of getting at least one head when two coins are tossed, we can use the concept of complementary probability.

#### Step 1: Understand the Sample Space
When two coins are tossed, each coin has two possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T). Hence, the total number of possible outcomes is:
- (Coin 1, Coin 2): HH, HT, TH, TT

This gives us 4 possible outcomes:
1. Heads on both coins (HH)
2. Heads on the first coin and Tails on the second (HT)
3. Tails on the first coin and Heads on the second (TH)
4. Tails on both coins (TT)

#### Step 2: Identify Favorable Outcomes
The event of getting at least one head includes the following outcomes:
1. HH (Heads on both coins)
2. HT (Heads on the first coin)
3. TH (Heads on the second coin)

These are 3 favorable outcomes.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
The probability of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

Total number of possible outcomes = 4  
Number of favorable outcomes (at least one head) = 3

Probability of getting at least one head = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = \( \frac{3}{4} \)

#### Conclusion
Therefore, the probability of getting at least one head when two coins are tossed is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

In uniform acceleration, if the velocity of an object increases from 4 m/s to 8 m/s in 2 seconds, what will be the velocity of the object in meters per second after 4 more seconds?

## Detailed Solution:

1. **Calculate the Acceleration:**

   The problem tells us that the object's velocity increases from 4 m/s to 8 m/s over a time period of 2 seconds. We can use the following formula to find the acceleration \(a\):

   \[
   a = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time taken}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t}
   \]

   Where:
   - \(v_1 = 4 \, \text{m/s}\) (initial velocity),
   - \(v_2 = 8 \, \text{m/s}\) (final velocity),
   - \(t = 2 \, \text{seconds}\).

   Substituting the values in gives:

   \[
   a = \frac{8 \, \text{m/s} - 4 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \, \text{s}} = \frac{4 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

   So, the acceleration is \(2 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

2. **Determine the Velocity After 4 More Seconds:**

   Knowing the acceleration, we can determine the velocity of the object after an additional 4 seconds. The velocity after a certain time can be found using the formula:

   \[
   v = u + at
   \]

   Where:
   - \(u = 8 \, \text{m/s}\) (velocity at the end of the first 2 seconds which is now the initial velocity for this new calculation),
   - \(a = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2\),
   - \(t = 4 \, \text{seconds}\).

""A 2 kg mass is falling from a height of 60 meters. When it is at a height of 10 meters from the ground, how many times its kinetic energy will be compared to its potential energy?""

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) at a certain height during the fall of an object.

### Step 1: Calculate Initial Potential Energy

The potential energy (PE) at the initial height is given by the formula:
\[ PE = m \times g \times h \]
where \( m = 2 \) kg is the mass, \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h = 60 \) m is the initial height.

\[ PE_{\text{initial}} = 2 \times 9.8 \times 60 = 1176 \, \text{Joules} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Potential Energy at 10 meters

At a height of 10 meters, the potential energy will be:
\[ PE_{10} = m \times g \times h_{10} \]
where \( h_{10} = 10 \) m.

\[ PE_{10} = 2 \times 9.8 \times 10 = 196 \, \text{Joules} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Kinetic Energy at 10 meters

The loss in potential energy from 60 meters to 10 meters is converted into kinetic energy. 

The difference in potential energy is:
\[ \Delta PE = PE_{\text{initial}} - PE_{10} = 1176 - 196 = 980 \, \text{Joules} \]

According to energy conservation, this difference is equal to the kinetic energy (KE) at 10 meters since energy is conserved in a system where only gravitational force acts.

\[ KE_{10} = \Delta PE = 980 \, \text{Joules} \]

### Step 4: Find the Ratio of Kinetic Energy to Potential Energy at 10 meters

To find out how many times the kinetic energy is compared to potential energy at 10 meters:

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{KE_{10}}{PE_{10}} = \frac{980}{196} = 5 \]

If \( A = \{1, 4, 6, 8\} \), how many ordered pairs can be formed when calculating \( A \times A \)?

## Solution:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs that can be formed from the set \( A \) when forming the Cartesian product \( A \times A \).

### Step 1: Understanding Cartesian Product
The Cartesian product \( A \times A \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a \) and \( b \) are elements of the set \( A \).

### Step 2: Elements of Set \( A \)
The set \( A \) is given as:

\[ A = \{1, 4, 6, 8\} \]

This set contains 4 elements.

### Step 3: Calculating Number of Ordered Pairs
For each element \( a \) in \( A \), we can pair it with every element \( b \) in \( A \) to form \((a, b)\). Since there are 4 elements in \( A \), for each first element of the pair, there are 4 possible second elements.

The total number of ordered pairs is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for the first term of the pair by the number of choices for the second term:

\[ |A \times A| = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

### Conclusion
Thus, the number of ordered pairs in \( A \times A \) is **16**.

   There are 15 white, 10 black, and 20 red balls in a basket. A ball is drawn at random. What is the probability that the ball is yellow?

2. **Solution:**

   To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of balls in the basket and then find out how many of those balls are yellow.

   - **Step 1:** Calculate the total number of balls in the basket.
     - White balls = 15
     - Black balls = 10
     - Red balls = 20

     Total number of balls = White balls + Black balls + Red balls
                           = 15 + 10 + 20
                           = 45

   - **Step 2:** Determine the number of yellow balls.
     Since the problem only mentions white, black, and red balls, and there is no mention of yellow balls, we can assume there are 0 yellow balls in the basket.

   - **Step 3:** Calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball.
     The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

     Number of favorable outcomes (yellow balls) = 0 (since there are no yellow balls)
     Total number of possible outcomes (total balls) = 45

     Probability of drawing a yellow ball = Number of yellow balls / Total number of balls
                                         = 0 / 45

The difference in the circumference of two wheels is 120 cm. What is the difference in their diameters in cm?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the circumference \( C \) and the diameter \( D \) of a circle, which is given by the formula:
\[ C = \pi D \]

From the problem statement, we have:
\[ C_1 - C_2 = 120 \text{ cm} \]
where \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are the circumferences of the first and second wheel, respectively.

Substituting the circumference formula, we get:
\[ \pi D_1 - \pi D_2 = 120 \]

This can be factored as:
\[ \pi (D_1 - D_2) = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by \( \pi \), we solve for the difference in diameters:
\[ D_1 - D_2 = \frac{120}{\pi} \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we calculate:
\[ D_1 - D_2 \approx \frac{120}{3.14} \]
\[ D_1 - D_2 \approx 38.22 \]

Therefore, the difference in the diameters of the two wheels is approximately 38.22 cm.

Rasel said that he had 452 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 9 (in hexadecimal) to Karim. How many bananas will he have left in the hexadecimal number system?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Hexadecimal System**:
   - The hexadecimal system is base 16. It uses numbers 0-9 and letters A-F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, and so on, up to F which stands for 15.

2. **Identify the Numbers in Hexadecimal**:
   - Rasel initially had `452` in hexadecimal.
   - He gave away `9` in hexadecimal.

3. **Convert the Hexadecimal Numbers to Decimal for Simplicity**:
   - Convert `452` from hexadecimal to decimal:
     - 4 × 16² + 5 × 16¹ + 2 × 16⁰
     - = 4 × 256 + 5 × 16 + 2 × 1
     - = 1024 + 80 + 2
     - = 1106 (in decimal)

   - Convert `9` from hexadecimal to decimal:
     - 9 is the same in both hexadecimal and decimal, so it is 9.

4. **Perform the Subtraction in Decimal**:
   - Subtract the number of bananas given away from the initial amount:
     - 1106 (initial amount in decimal) - 9 (given away)
     - = 1097 (in decimal)

5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal**:
   - Convert 1097 from decimal to hexadecimal:
     - Divide the number by 16 and keep track of remainders.
     - 1097 ÷ 16 = 68 remainder 9 (rightmost digit)
     - 68 ÷ 16 = 4 remainder 4
     - 4 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 4 (leftmost digit)

   - Thus, 1097 in decimal is `449` in hexadecimal.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - After giving 9 bananas to Karim, Rasel will have `449` in hexadecimal.

""How many grams of sodium carbonate should be added to 2 liters of solution to make it a semi-molar solution?""

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Concept of Molarity:**
   - Molarity (\( M \)) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

2. **Define Semi-Molar:**
   - A semi-molar solution means it is 0.5 molar. Therefore, for a semi-molar sodium carbonate solution, the concentration should be 0.5 moles per liter.

3. **Determine the Required Moles for 2 Liters:**
   - Since we have 2 liters of solution and we want it to be 0.5 molar, we calculate the total moles of sodium carbonate required:
     \[
     \text{Required moles} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume in Liters} = 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 2 \, \text{L} = 1 \, \text{mole}
     \]

4. **Determine the Molecular Weight of Sodium Carbonate (\(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3\)):**
   - Sodium (\(\text{Na}\)) has an atomic weight of 23 g/mol. Since there are two sodium atoms, their total weight is \(23 \times 2 = 46\) g/mol.
   - Carbon (\(\text{C}\)) has an atomic weight of 12 g/mol.
   - Oxygen (\(\text{O}\)) has an atomic weight of 16 g/mol. Since there are three oxygen atoms, their total weight is \(16 \times 3 = 48\) g/mol.
   - Adding these up gives the molecular weight of sodium carbonate:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of } \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 = 46 + 12 + 48 = 106 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Mass of Sodium Carbonate Needed:**
   - Since we need 1 mole of sodium carbonate to achieve the semi-molar concentration in 2 liters of solution:

A solid metal sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. What is the height of the resulting cylinder in cm?

## Detailed Solution:

Given:
- Radius of the sphere, \( r_{\text{sphere}} = 6 \) cm
- Radius of the cylinder, \( r_{\text{cylinder}} = 3 \) cm

We need to find the height of the cylinder, denoted as \( h \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere
The volume \( V \) of a sphere is calculated using the formula:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Substituting the given radius of the sphere:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 = 288 \pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder
When the sphere is melted to form a cylinder, the volume of the metal remains conserved. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder will also be \( 288 \pi \) cubic cm.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]

Substituting the given radius of the cylinder and setting it equal to the sphere's volume:
\[
\pi (3)^2 h = 288 \pi
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
9\pi h = 288 \pi
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the Height \( h \)
Canceling \(\pi\) from both sides of the equation:
\[
9h = 288
\]

Solving for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{288}{9} = 32
\]

Thus, the height of the cylinder is 32 cm.

When a die is rolled and a coin is tossed together, what is the probability of getting a number divisible by 3 on the die and any side of the coin?

### Solution:

To find the probability of obtaining a number divisible by 3 on a die and any side on a coin, we must first compute the probabilities separately for the die and the coin, and then consider their outcomes together.

**Step 1: Probability of a number divisible by 3 on the die**

A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. The numbers that are divisible by 3 are:
- 3
- 6

So, there are 2 favorable outcomes when it comes to getting a number divisible by 3. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number divisible by 3 on the die is:
\[ 
P(\text{number divisible by 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} 
\]

**Step 2: Probability of getting any side of the coin**

When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes:
- Heads (H)
- Tails (T)

Any side of the coin is definitely one of these outcomes, so:
\[ 
P(\text{any side of coin}) = 1 
\]

**Step 3: Combined probability**

Since we are interested in the probability of both events happening simultaneously (i.e., the number on the die is divisible by 3 and any side of the coin appears), we can multiply the probabilities of the independent events:

\[ 
P(\text{number divisible by 3 and any side of coin}) = P(\text{number divisible by 3}) \times P(\text{any side of coin}) = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3} 
\]

Therefore, the probability of getting a number divisible by 3 on the die and any side on the coin is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

**Conclusion:**
The probability of obtaining a number divisible by 3 on the die and any side on the coin is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The surface areas of the small and large pistons of a hydraulic press are 10 square centimeters and 350 square centimeters, respectively. If a force of 100 Newton is applied to the small piston, what force will be exerted on the large piston?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Hydraulic Press Principle**:
   The operation of a hydraulic press is based on Pascal's principle, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. This means the pressure in different parts of the hydraulic system will be the same.

2. **Pressure Calculation**:
   - The pressure applied on the small piston can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     P = \frac{F}{A}
     \]
     Where \( P \) is the pressure, \( F \) is the force applied, and \( A \) is the area on which the force is applied.

   - For the small piston:
     \[
     A_{\text{small}} = 10 \, \text{cm}^2 
     \]
     \[
     F_{\text{small}} = 100 \, \text{N}

   - The pressure applied on the small piston:
     \[
     P_{\text{small}} = \frac{F_{\text{small}}}{A_{\text{small}}} = \frac{100 \, \text{N}}{10 \, \text{cm}^2} = 10 \, \text{N/cm}^2 
     \]

3. **Pressure on the Large Piston**:
   Since the pressure is constant throughout the fluid, the pressure on the large piston is also 10 N/cm².

4. **Force on the Large Piston**:
   - The area of the large piston is:
     \[
     A_{\text{large}} = 350 \, \text{cm}^2 
     \]

   - Using the same pressure on the large piston, the force can be calculated as:
     \[
     F_{\text{large}} = P_{\text{large}} \times A_{\text{large}} = 10 \, \text{N/cm}^2 \times 350 \, \text{cm}^2

A circle with a radius of 2 cm has an arc that subtends a central angle of 90 degrees. What is the approximate length of the arc in cm?

## Solution:

To find the length of an arc in a circle, we use the formula for arc length:

\[
\text{Arc Length} = 2 \pi r \left( \frac{\theta}{360} \right)
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle,
- \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees.

Given:
- Radius, \( r = 2 \) cm
- Central angle, \( \theta = 90 \) degrees

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Arc Length} = 2 \pi \times 2 \times \left( \frac{90}{360} \right)
\]

Let's simplify the calculation:

1. Calculate the fraction of the circle the arc represents:
   \[
   \frac{90}{360} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

2. Multiply by the circumference of the whole circle, which is \( 2 \pi r = 2 \pi \times 2 = 4 \pi \).

3. Putting it all together:
   \[
   \text{Arc Length} = 4 \pi \times \frac{1}{4} = \pi

\[ 1 \text{ degree} = \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ radians} \]

For a 6-degree angle:

\[ \theta = 6 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{30} \text{ radians} \]

### Step 2: Apply the Arc Length Formula

Given:
- Radius \( r = 6440 \text{ km} \)
- Central angle \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{30} \text{ radians} \)

Plug these values into the arc length formula:

\[ \text{Arc length} = 6440 \times \frac{\pi}{30} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Arc Length

Now compute the actual numerical value:

\[ \text{Arc length} = 6440 \times \frac{\pi}{30} \]

Using the value of \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):

\[ \text{Arc length} = 6440 \times \frac{3.14159}{30} \]

\[ \text{Arc length} \approx 6440 \times 0.10472 \]

\[ \text{Arc length} \approx 674.1 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the distance between Dinajpur and Rangpur is approximately 674.1 km.

""A container with a height of 0.20 meters is filled with water. What is the pressure experienced at the bottom of the container?""

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the pressure at the bottom of a container filled with water. The pressure exerted by a fluid at a certain depth is calculated using the formula:

\[ P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h \]

where:
- \( P \) is the pressure at the bottom of the container,
- \( \rho \) is the density of the fluid (water, in this case),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( h \) is the height of the fluid column.

### Step 1: Identify the Known Values

1. **Density of Water (\( \rho \)):** For water, the density is approximately \( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).
2. **Acceleration due to Gravity (\( g \)):** The standard value is \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
3. **Height of Water Column (\( h \)):** Given as \( 0.20 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Apply the Formula

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[ P = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 0.20 \, \text{m} \]

### Step 3: Perform the Calculation

\[ P = 1000 \times 9.81 \times 0.20 \]

\[ P = 1000 \times (9.81 \times 0.20) \]

\[ P = 1000 \times 1.962 \]

\[ P = 1962 \, \text{Pascal} \]

Thus, the pressure at the bottom of the container is 1962 Pascals.

To produce 6 moles of ammonia, how many moles of hydrogen are required?

### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we first need to refer to the chemical equation for the synthesis of ammonia. Ammonia (\(NH_3\)) is produced via the Haber process, which is represented by the balanced chemical equation:

\[ N_2 + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3 \]

This equation indicates that:

- 1 mole of nitrogen gas (\(N_2\)) reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas (\(H_2\)) to produce 2 moles of ammonia (\(NH_3\)).

Now, let's consider the task of producing 6 moles of ammonia. We need to determine the moles of hydrogen required based on the stoichiometry (molar ratios) provided by the balanced equation.

1. According to the equation, 2 moles of \(NH_3\) require 3 moles of \(H_2\).

2. We want to produce 6 moles of \(NH_3\), which is three times the amount shown in the balanced chemical equation. Therefore, we need to adjust the amount of \(H_2\) accordingly:

   \[
   \text{Moles of } H_2 \text{ required} = 3 \times \left(\frac{6 \text{ moles of } NH_3}{2 \text{ moles of } NH_3}\right) 
   \]

3. Simplifying the fraction \(\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)\) gives us 3.

4. Hence:
   \[
   \text{Moles of } H_2 = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ moles}
   \]

So, to produce 6 moles of ammonia, 9 moles of hydrogen are required.

10 grams of sodium hydroxide react with 5 grams of carbon dioxide. What is the mass of the salt produced?

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To determine the mass of the salt produced when sodium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide, we first need to understand the chemical reaction involved:

1. **Chemical Reaction:**
   \[
   2 \text{NaOH} + \text{CO}_2 \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]

   Sodium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to form sodium carbonate and water.

2. **Molar Mass Calculation:**

     - Sodium (Na) = 23 g/mol
     - Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol
     - Hydrogen (H) = 1 g/mol
     - Total = \(23 + 16 + 1 = 40\) g/mol

   - **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):**
     - Carbon (C) = 12 g/mol
     - Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol
     - Total = \(12 + (16 \times 2) = 44\) g/mol

   - **Sodium Carbonate (Na₂CO₃):**
     - Sodium (Na) = \(2 \times 23 = 46\) g/mol
     - Carbon (C) = 12 g/mol
     - Oxygen (O) = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) g/mol
     - Total = \(46 + 12 + 48 = 106\) g/mol

3. **Stoichiometry of the Reaction:**
   According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO₂ to produce 1 mole of Na₂CO₃.

A solution containing potassium carbonate is prepared with a volume of 750 ml and a concentration of 0.125 molar. How many moles of potassium carbonate are in the solution?

### Solution:
To find the number of moles of potassium carbonate present in the solution, we can use the formula for molarity, which is given by:

\[ \text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{Moles of solute (mol)}}{\text{Volume of solution (L)}} \]

We are given:
- Molarity (M) = 0.125 mol/L
- Volume of solution = 750 ml

First, we need to convert the volume from milliliters to liters because molarity is expressed in terms of liters. 

\[ 750 \, \text{ml} = \frac{750}{1000} \, \text{L} = 0.75 \, \text{L} \]

Now that we have the volume in liters, we can substitute the values into the molarity formula to solve for the number of moles of potassium carbonate:

\[ 0.125 = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{0.75} \]

Rearranging to solve for the moles of solute:

\[ \text{Moles of solute} = 0.125 \times 0.75 \]

Calculating the above expression:

\[ \text{Moles of solute} = 0.09375 \]

Thus, the number of moles of potassium carbonate in the solution is 0.09375 moles.

A body is thrown vertically upwards with a speed of 196 m/s. What will be its speed after 10 seconds?

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we will use the equations of motion under gravity. When an object is thrown upwards, it decelerates due to gravity, which is approximately \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) in the downward direction. 

Here, we need to find the speed of the object after 10 seconds. 

**Given:**
- Initial speed (\( u \)) = 196 m/s
- Time (\( t \)) = 10 s
- Acceleration due to gravity (\( g \)) = -9.8 m/s\(^2\) (negative because it is acting in the opposite direction of the initial velocity)

We can use the first equation of motion:
\[ v = u + at \]

Where:
- \( v \) is the final velocity,
- \( u \) is the initial velocity,
- \( a \) is the acceleration,
- \( t \) is the time period.

Plugging in the values:
\[ a = -g = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]
\[ u = 196 \, \text{m/s} \]
\[ t = 10 \, \text{s} \]

\[ v = 196 \, \text{m/s} + (-9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2) \times 10 \, \text{s} \]
\[ v = 196 \, \text{m/s} - 98 \, \text{m/s} \]
\[ v = 98 \, \text{m/s} \]

Therefore, the speed of the object after 10 seconds is 98 m/s.

To determine the increase in the length of the steel beam when the temperature changes, we use the formula for linear expansion:

\[ \Delta L = L_0 \times \alpha \times \Delta T \]

where:
- \(\Delta L\) is the change in length,
- \(L_0\) is the original length,

What is the percentage of carbon in methane?

## Solution
To find the percentage of carbon in methane, we first need to determine the molecular formula of methane. Methane is a simple hydrocarbon with the chemical formula \( CH_4 \). This indicates that one molecule of methane consists of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.

Next, we need to calculate the molar mass of methane. The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule.

1. **Atomic Mass of Carbon (C):** Approximately 12.01 grams/mole.
2. **Atomic Mass of Hydrogen (H):** Approximately 1.01 grams/mole.

Now, compute the molar mass of methane:

- Molar mass of carbon in methane:
  \[
  1 \times 12.01 = 12.01 \text{ grams/mole}
  \]

- Molar mass of hydrogen in methane:
  \[
  4 \times 1.01 = 4.04 \text{ grams/mole}
  \]

Thus, the total molar mass of methane is:
\[
12.01 + 4.04 = 16.05 \text{ grams/mole}
\]

To find the percentage of carbon in methane, we divide the molar mass of carbon by the molar mass of methane and multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage:

\[
\frac{12.01}{16.05} \times 100 \approx 74.83\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of carbon in methane is approximately 74.83%.

A wheel covers a distance of 3.25 kilometers by rotating 25 times. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Total Distance Covered:**
   The wheel covers a total distance of 3.25 kilometers. We need to convert this distance into meters, as we want to find the diameter in meters.

   \[
   3.25 \text{ km} = 3.25 \times 1000 \text{ meters} = 3250 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Distance Covered in One Rotation:**
   Since the wheel rotates 25 times to cover 3250 meters, the distance covered by one complete rotation of the wheel is:

   \[
   \text{Distance per rotation} = \frac{3250 \text{ meters}}{25} = 130 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Relate Circumference to Distance Covered:**
   The distance covered in one rotation of the wheel is the circumference of the wheel. Therefore, the circumference \( C \) of the wheel is 130 meters.

4. **Relate Circumference to Diameter:**
   The formula for the circumference \( C \) of a circle (wheel) in terms of its diameter \( d \) is given by:

   \[
   C = \pi \times d
   \]

   Here, we need to solve for the diameter \( d \).

5. **Solve for the Diameter:**
   Rearranging the formula to solve for \( d \):

   \[
   d = \frac{C}{\pi}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   d = \frac{130}{\pi}
   \]

   Using the approximate value \(\pi \approx 3.1416\), we compute:

   \[
   d \approx \frac{130}{3.1416} \approx 41.39 \text{ meters}
   \]

A stone is dropped from a tower that is 2000 meters high. How much time will it take to reach the ground? (Acceleration due to gravity \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \))

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use the equations of motion that describe the distance an object travels under constant acceleration. The specific equation we'll use is:

\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

Where:
- \( s \) is the distance the object travels (2000 meters in this case).
- \( u \) is the initial velocity (0 m/s, since the stone is dropped).
- \( a \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
- \( t \) is the time in seconds which we need to find.

Since the stone is dropped, its initial velocity \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting the known values into the equation gives:

\[ 2000 = 0 \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot t^2 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2000 = 5t^2 \]

To isolate \( t^2 \), divide both sides by 5:

\[ t^2 = \frac{2000}{5} \]

\[ t^2 = 400 \]

Now, solve for \( t \) by taking the square root of both sides:

\[ t = \sqrt{400} \]

\[ t = 20 \]

Therefore, it will take 20 seconds for the stone to reach the ground.

If a runner with a mass of 60 kg has a kinetic energy of 1920 Joules, what is their velocity?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the velocity of the runner, we need to use the formula for kinetic energy, which is given by:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

Where:
- \( KE \) is the kinetic energy, which is 1920 Joules.
- \( m \) is the mass of the runner, which is 60 kg.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the runner, which we need to find.

#### Step 1: Set up the equation with the given values
Plugging in the known values into the kinetic energy equation, we get:

\[ 1920 = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \times v^2 \]

#### Step 2: Simplify and solve for \( v^2 \)
Simplifying the expression:

\[ 1920 = 30 \times v^2 \]

Divide both sides by 30 to isolate \( v^2 \):

\[ v^2 = \frac{1920}{30} \]

Perform the division:

\[ v^2 = 64 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate \( v \)
To find \( v \), take the square root of both sides:

\[ v = \sqrt{64} \]

\[ v = 8 \]

Thus, the velocity of the runner is 8 meters per second.

A car accelerates from a speed of 36 km/h to 72 km/h in 1 minute, and then further accelerates to 108 km/h in the next 1 minute. What is the acceleration of the car?

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to find the acceleration of the car during each minute segment and then determine if the acceleration is constant or varies.

1. **Understanding the change in velocity**:  
   - Initial velocity (\(v_0\)) = 36 km/h
   - Velocity after 1 minute (\(v_1\)) = 72 km/h
   - Velocity after another 1 minute (\(v_2\)) = 108 km/h

2. **Convert speeds from km/h to m/s**:   
   Since acceleration is typically calculated in meters per second squared (m/s²), converting the velocities from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s) is necessary.
   - \(v_0 = 36 \text{ km/h} = \frac{36 \times 1000}{3600} = 10 \text{ m/s}\)
   - \(v_1 = 72 \text{ km/h} = \frac{72 \times 1000}{3600} = 20 \text{ m/s}\)
   - \(v_2 = 108 \text{ km/h} = \frac{108 \times 1000}{3600} = 30 \text{ m/s}\)

3. **Calculate the acceleration during the first minute**:
   - Time (\(\Delta t_1\)) = 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Change in velocity (\(\Delta v_1\)) = \(v_1 - v_0 = 20 \text{ m/s} - 10 \text{ m/s} = 10 \text{ m/s}\)
   - Acceleration (\(a_1\)) = \(\frac{\Delta v_1}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{10 \text{ m/s}}{60 \text{ s}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ m/s}^2\)

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To find the specific heat capacity (\(c\)) of the material, we will use the formula:

   \[
   Q = mc\Delta T
   \]

   where:
   - \(Q\) is the heat energy supplied (in joules),
   - \(m\) is the mass of the substance (in kilograms),
   - \(c\) is the specific heat capacity (in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius),
   - \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature (in degrees Celsius).

   **Step 1:** Identify the given values from the problem:
   - Mass, \(m = 5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{kg}\)
   - Heat supplied, \(Q = 1520 \, \text{joules}\)
   - Initial temperature = 20°C
   - Final temperature = 100°C

   **Step 2:** Calculate the change in temperature (\(\Delta T\)):
   \[
   \Delta T = \text{Final temperature} - \text{Initial temperature} = 100°C - 20°C = 80°C
   \]

   **Step 3:** Substitute the values into the formula \(Q = mc\Delta T\) to solve for \(c\):
   \[
   1520 = (5 \times 10^{-2}) \times c \times 80
   \]

   **Step 4:** Simplify and solve for \(c\):
   \[
   1520 = 4 \times 10^{-2} \times c

   \[
   c = \frac{1520}{4 \times 10^{-2}}

In a bag, there are 12 blue balls, 16 white balls, and 20 black balls. What is the probability that a randomly selected ball is blue?

### Step 2: Explanation and Solution

To find the probability that a randomly selected ball is blue, we need to use the formula for probability, which is:

\[
P(\text{Blue ball}) = \frac{\text{Number of blue balls}}{\text{Total number of balls}}
\]

**Step 2.1: Calculate the total number of balls**

First, we calculate the total number of balls in the bag by adding the number of each color of balls:

- Number of blue balls = 12
- Number of white balls = 16
- Number of black balls = 20

\[
\text{Total number of balls} = 12 + 16 + 20 = 48
\]

**Step 2.2: Calculate the probability of picking a blue ball**

The probability of picking a blue ball is the ratio of the number of blue balls to the total number of balls:

\[
P(\text{Blue ball}) = \frac{12}{48}
\]

**Step 2.3: Simplify the probability**

To simplify the fraction \(\frac{12}{48}\), divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor, which is 12:

\[
\frac{12}{48} = \frac{12 \div 12}{48 \div 12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Problem: What is the probability that a randomly chosen number from the natural numbers 1 to 200 is a perfect cube?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Perfect Cubes:**
   A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as \( n^3 \), where \( n \) is an integer.

2. **Finding Perfect Cubes up to 200:**
   We need to determine which perfect cubes are less than or equal to 200.

   - \( 1^3 = 1 \)
   - \( 2^3 = 8 \)
   - \( 3^3 = 27 \)
   - \( 4^3 = 64 \)
   - \( 5^3 = 125 \)
   - \( 6^3 = 216 \) 

   Since \( 6^3 = 216 \) is greater than 200, we stop here. Thus, the numbers 1, 8, 27, 64, and 125 are the only perfect cubes within our range.

3. **Counting the Perfect Cubes:**
   There are 5 perfect cubes in the range from 1 to 200: 1, 8, 27, 64, and 125.

4. **Calculating Probability:**
   The total number of natural numbers from 1 to 200 is 200.

   Probability \( P \) of selecting a perfect cube is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (perfect cubes) to the total number of possible outcomes (numbers from 1 to 200).

   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of perfect cubes}}{\text{Total numbers}}

   \[
   P = \frac{5}{200} = \frac{1}{40}
   \]

   Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 200 is a perfect cube is \(\frac{1}{40}\).

""When four five-taka coins are tossed together, how many sample points will there be?""

## Detailed Solution:
In probability theory and statistics, a ""sample point"" refers to an individual possible outcome of an experiment. When dealing with coins, each coin has two possible outcomes when tossed: heads (H) or tails (T).

Since we have four coins, and each coin has two possible outcomes, we can consider each coin toss independently.

1. **First Coin:** This coin can result in 2 outcomes: H or T.

2. **Second Coin:** Similar to the first, this coin also has 2 outcomes: H or T.

3. **Third Coin:** Again, this coin has 2 outcomes: H or T.

4. **Fourth Coin:** Finally, this coin has 2 outcomes: H or T.

To find the total number of sample points, we need to determine all possible combinations of outcomes from these four coins. The total number of combinations can be calculated using the fundamental principle of counting, which involves multiplying the number of outcomes for each independent event:

\[ 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^4 \]

Calculating \( 2^4 \):

\[ 2^4 = 16 \]

Thus, when four coins are tossed together, there are 16 distinct possible outcomes, or sample points.

These possible outcomes (sample points) are:
- HHHH
- HHHT
- HHTH
- HHTT
- HTHH
- HTHT
- HTTH
- HTTT
- THHH
- THHT
- THTH
- THTT
- TTHH
- TTHT
- TTTH
- TTTT

If an object is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 19.6 m/s, how high will the object rise to its maximum height?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use the principles of kinematics in physics. We are given:
- Initial velocity (\(u\)) = 19.6 m/s (upward)

We have to find the maximum height (\(h\)) that the object will reach. When the object reaches its maximum height, the final velocity (\(v\)) becomes 0 m/s. The acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) is -9.8 m/s² (the negative sign indicates that gravity is acting in the opposite direction to the motion of the object).

We can use the following kinematic equation to find the maximum height:
\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s \]
where
- \(v\) is the final velocity,
- \(u\) is the initial velocity,
- \(a\) is the acceleration, and
- \(s\) is the displacement (which in this case is the maximum height \(h\)).

Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[ 0^2 = (19.6)^2 + 2 \times (-9.8) \times h \]

Solve for \(h\):
\[ 0 = 384.16 - 19.6 h \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \(h\):
\[ 19.6 h = 384.16 \]

Divide both sides by 19.6 to find \(h\):
\[ h = \frac{384.16}{19.6} \]

Calculating the value:
\[ h = 19.6 \]

The object will rise to a maximum height of 19.6 meters.

A 10-gram mass object is dropped from a height of 60 meters. At what height above the ground will the potential energy of the object be five times its kinetic energy?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the basic concept of energy conversion when an object is dropped from a certain height. The total mechanical energy of the system is conserved (assuming no air resistance), which consists of potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE). 

1. **Define Potential and Kinetic Energy:**

   The potential energy (PE) of an object at height \( h \) is given by:
   \[
   PE = m \cdot g \cdot h
   \]
   where:
   - \( m = 0.01 \) kg (since 10 grams equals 0.01 kg),
   - \( g = 9.8 \) m/s² is the acceleration due to gravity,
   - \( h \) is the height above the ground.

   The kinetic energy (KE) of the object falling is given by:
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]

2. **Total Mechanical Energy Conservation:**

   The total mechanical energy at the starting height (60 meters) can be represented entirely by potential energy, since initial velocity is zero:
   \[
   PE_{\text{initial}} = m \cdot g \cdot 60
   \]
   \[
   PE_{\text{initial}} = 0.01 \times 9.8 \times 60 = 5.88 \text{ J}
   \]

   As the object falls, the total energy remains constant:
   \[
   PE + KE = 5.88 \text{ J}
   \]

3. **Condition for the Problem:**

   We need to find height \( h \) such that:
   \[
   PE = 5 \times KE
   \]

   From the conservation of energy:
   \[
   m \cdot g \cdot h + \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = 5.88
   \]

   Replacing KE by \(\frac{PE}{5}\), we have:
   \[
   m \cdot g \cdot h + \frac{1}{5}(m \cdot g \cdot h)"

""What is the probability of getting an odd number when a fair die is rolled?""

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the problem:** 
   A standard die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. In this scenario, we need to determine the probability of rolling an odd number.

2. **Identify the odd numbers on a die:**
   The odd numbers on a standard die are 1, 3, and 5. Thus, there are three odd numbers possible when rolling a die.

3. **Determine the total outcomes:**
   Since a die has 6 faces, there are a total of 6 possible outcomes when rolling the die.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability of an event is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
   \]

   - Here, the number of favorable outcomes (rolling an odd number) is 3.
   - The total number of outcomes is 6.

   Substituting the numbers into the formula, we get:

   \[
   \text{Probability of rolling an odd number} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number on a fair die is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

In 500 ml of solution, 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved. What is the concentration of the solution?

**2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

To find the concentration of the sulfuric acid solution, we need to calculate the concentration in terms of molarity. Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. 

**Step 1: Find the molar mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).**

The molar mass of H₂SO₄ can be calculated by adding the atomic masses of its constituent atoms:
- Hydrogen (H): 2 × 1 = 2 g/mol
- Sulfur (S): 1 × 32 = 32 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 4 × 16 = 64 g/mol

Adding these, the molar mass of H₂SO₄ = 2 + 32 + 64 = 98 g/mol.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid in the solution.**

The number of moles of a substance is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass of substance (g)}}{\text{Molar mass (g/mol)}}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
\text{Moles of } H₂SO₄ = \frac{24.5 \text{ g}}{98 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.25 \text{ mol}
\]

**Step 3: Convert the volume of solution from milliliters to liters.**

Since molarity is moles per liter, we need to convert 500 ml to liters:
\[
500 \text{ ml} = 0.500 \text{ L}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the molarity of the solution.**

Molarity (\(M\)) is calculated as follows:
\[
M = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Volume of solution (L)}}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
M = \frac{0.25 \text{ mol}}{0.500 \text{ L}} = 0.5 \text{ M}
\]

   A number is randomly selected from the natural numbers between 10 and 21. What is the probability that the number is divisible by 2 or 3?

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution:**

   To find the probability that a randomly selected number is divisible by 2 or 3, we perform the following steps:

   Step 1: First, list all the natural numbers between 10 and 21, inclusive. These numbers are:  
   \( 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 \).

   Step 2: Determine how many numbers are in this list. There are 12 numbers.

   Step 3: Identify which of these numbers are divisible by 2:
   - A number is divisible by 2 if it is even.
   - The even numbers in our list are:  
   \( 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 \).

   So, there are 6 numbers divisible by 2.

   Step 4: Identify which of these numbers are divisible by 3:
   - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
   - The numbers divisible by 3 are:  
   \( 12, 15, 18, 21 \).

   So, there are 4 numbers divisible by 3.

   Step 5: Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to find numbers divisible by 2 or 3:
   - We need to calculate \( |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \),
     where \( |A| \) is the count of numbers divisible by 2,
     \( |B| \) is the count of numbers divisible by 3, and
     \( |A \cap B| \) is count of numbers divisible by both 2 and 3.
   - The numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., by 6) are:  
   \( 12, 18 \).

   So, there are 2 numbers divisible by both 2 and 3.

   Calculate \( |A \cup B| \):

Russell said that he had 452 (in hexadecimal) bananas, but he gave 1000 (in octal) to Karim. How many bananas will he have left in our number system (decimal)?

## Step-by-step Solution:

### Step 1: Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal
The number 452 is given in hexadecimal. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system.

To convert 452 from hexadecimal to decimal:
- \( 452_{16} = 4 \times 16^2 + 5 \times 16^1 + 2 \times 16^0 \)

Calculating this:
- \( 4 \times 16^2 = 4 \times 256 = 1024 \)
- \( 5 \times 16^1 = 5 \times 16 = 80 \)
- \( 2 \times 16^0 = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)

Adding these values together gives:
- \( 1024 + 80 + 2 = 1106 \)

So, 452 in hexadecimal is 1106 in decimal.

### Step 2: Convert Octal to Decimal
The number 1000 is given in octal. Octal is a base-8 number system.

To convert 1000 from octal to decimal:
- \( 1000_{8} = 1 \times 8^3 + 0 \times 8^2 + 0 \times 8^1 + 0 \times 8^0 \)

Calculating this:
- \( 1 \times 8^3 = 1 \times 512 = 512 \)
- Since the rest are zeros, their contribution is 0.

So, 1000 in octal is 512 in decimal.

### Step 3: Subtract the Bananas Given Away
Russell initially had 1106 bananas (in decimal). He gave away 512 bananas.

To find out how many bananas he has left:
- \( 1106 - 512 = 594 \)

A solid metal sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 4 cm. What is the lateral surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

## Solution:

First, let's outline our approach:
1. Calculate the volume of the metal sphere.
2. Determine the volume of the cylinder formed from the sphere.
3. Use the volume to find the radius of the cylinder.
4. Calculate the lateral surface area of the cylinder.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere

The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Given the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, the radius \( r \) is half of that, i.e., 3 cm. Thus:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36\pi \, \text{cubic centimeters}
\]

### Step 2: Volume of the Cylinder

The melted metal forms a cylinder, so the volume of the cylinder will be the same as the volume of the sphere:

\[
V = 36\pi \, \text{cubic centimeters}
\]

### Step 3: Find the Radius of the Cylinder

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

Given the height of the cylinder \( h = 4 \, \text{cm} \), we can equate this to the sphere's volume and solve for the radius \( r \):
\[
36\pi = \pi r^2 \times 4
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \pi \), we have:
\[
36 = 4r^2
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
9 = r^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
r = 3 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area of the Cylinder

The lateral surface area of a cylinder (also known as the curved surface area) is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]

Substituting the known values \( r = 3 \, \text{cm} \) and \( h = 4 \"

What is the mass of \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) oxygen atoms?

**Solution:**

To find the mass of \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) oxygen atoms, we should understand that \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) is Avogadro's number, which is the number of units (atoms, molecules, etc.) in one mole of substance.

1. **Determine the Molar Mass of Oxygen Atom:**
   The atomic mass of an oxygen atom is approximately 16 atomic mass units (amu). This means that one mole of oxygen atoms has a mass of 16 grams per mole.

2. **Use Avogadro's Number:**
   Avogadro's number tells us that one mole of any substance contains \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) units of that substance. Here we have \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) atoms of oxygen, which is exactly one mole.

3. **Calculate the Mass:**
   Since \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) oxygen atoms make up one mole, and one mole of oxygen atoms has a mass of 16 grams, the mass of \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) oxygen atoms is therefore 16 grams.

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To find the percentage composition of oxygen in sodium hydroxide (NaOH), we first need to determine the molar mass of NaOH and the molar mass contribution of oxygen within it.

   **Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of NaOH.**

   - Sodium (Na): The atomic mass is approximately 23 grams/mole.
   - Oxygen (O): The atomic mass is approximately 16 grams/mole.
   - Hydrogen (H): The atomic mass is approximately 1 gram/mole.

   Now, add these atomic masses to find the molar mass of NaOH:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of NaOH} = \text{Mass of Na} + \text{Mass of O} + \text{Mass of H} = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 \text{ grams/mole}
   \]

   **Step 2: Calculate the mass contribution and percentage of oxygen in NaOH.**

   The oxygen component accounts for 16 grams in the total molar mass of NaOH (40 grams/mole).

   Therefore, the percentage of oxygen in NaOH is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Oxygen} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of O}}{\text{Molar mass of NaOH}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Oxygen} = \left( \frac{16}{40} \right) \times 100\% = 40\%

1 kg of ice is heated by 1 Kelvin. How much heat is required?

### Solution:

To determine how much heat is required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of ice by 1 Kelvin, we can use the formula:

\[ Q = mc\Delta T \]

where:
- \( Q \) is the heat energy required,
- \( m \) is the mass of the substance, here it is 1 kg,
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of the substance,
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

For ice, the specific heat capacity \( c \) is approximately \( 2.09 \, \text{J/g}^\circ \text{C} \) or equivalently \( 2.09 \, \text{kJ/kg K} \) (since 1 Kelvin is equivalent to 1 degree Celsius in terms of temperature change).

Given:
- \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( c = 2.09 \, \text{kJ/kg K} \),
- \(\Delta T = 1 \, \text{K}\).

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ Q = (1 \, \text{kg}) \times (2.09 \, \text{kJ/kg K}) \times (1 \, \text{K}) \]

\[ Q = 2.09 \, \text{kJ} \]

## Step-by-Step Solution

To find the gravitational acceleration at a height above the Earth's surface, we can use the formula for gravitational acceleration:

\[
g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant, approximately \( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \),
- \( M \) is the mass of the Earth, \( 5.98 \times 10^{24} \) kg,
- \( r \) is the total distance from the center of the Earth to the point in question.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Distance \( r \)

The total distance \( r \) is the sum of the Earth’s radius and the height above the Earth’s surface:
\[
r = R_{\text{Earth}} + h = 6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} + 500 \times 10^3 \, \text{m}

The atmospheric pressure at a certain place is 93296 pascal. The density of kerosene is 800 kg/m³, and the density of benzene is 980 kg/m³. What is the height of a mercury column in meters?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the height of a mercury column that corresponds to the given atmospheric pressure, we need to use the principle of hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure equation is given by:

\[ P = \rho g h \]

where:
- \( P \) is the pressure,
- \( \rho \) (rho) is the density of the liquid,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( h \) is the height of the liquid column.

### Step 1: Setting up the equation

We are given:
- \( P = 93296 \) Pascal,
- \( g = 9.81 \) m/s² (approximate value of gravity).

We need to find \( h \), and we know the atmospheric pressure is being balanced by the pressure of a mercury column.

### Step 2: Determine the density of mercury

Since the problem doesn't provide the density of mercury, we use the standard density value for mercury:
- \( \rho_{mercury} = 13546 \) kg/m³.

### Step 3: Calculating the height of the mercury column

Using the hydrostatic pressure formula:

\[ 93296 = 13546 \times 9.81 \times h \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{93296}{13546 \times 9.81} \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( h \)

First calculate the denominator:

\[ 13546 \times 9.81 = 132892.26 \]

Now divide to find the height \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{93296}{132892.26} \]

\[ h \approx 0.702 \, \text{m} \]

## Conclusion

Thus, the height of the mercury column that corresponds to the given atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.702 meters.

## Solution:
Let's denote the two angles as \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \) is the larger angle and \( y \) is the smaller angle.

### Step 1: Setup the Equations
1. According to the problem, the sum of the two angles is 60 degrees:
   \[
   x + y = 60
   \]
2. The difference between the two angles is 30 degrees:
   \[
   x - y = 30
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations
We need to solve the above equations simultaneously.

#### Adding the Equations:
\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 60 + 30
\]
\[
2x = 90
\]

#### Solve for \( x \):
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

### Step 3: Verify and Find \( y \)
Using the first equation to find \( y \):
\[
x + y = 60
\]
Substitute \( x = 45 \):
\[
45 + y = 60
\]

Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 60 - 45 = 15
\]

### Step 4: Verification
We can verify our solution by checking if these values satisfy both original conditions:
- Sum: \( 45 + 15 = 60 \)
- Difference: \( 45 - 15 = 30 \)

Both conditions are satisfied. Thus, the measure of the larger angle is correct.

In a container, 40 grams of sodium metal and 35.5 grams of chlorine gas were placed. Under suitable conditions, a reaction was allowed to occur to produce sodium chloride. How many grams of sodium chloride will be produced?

### Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the chemical reaction occurring and apply the principle of conservation of mass.

#### Step 1: Identify the chemical reaction.
The reaction between sodium (\( \text{Na} \)) and chlorine (\( \text{Cl}_2 \)) is:
\[
2 \text{Na} + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{NaCl}
\]
This equation shows that 2 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of chlorine gas to produce 2 moles of sodium chloride (\( \text{NaCl} \)).

#### Step 2: Calculate molar masses.
- Molar mass of sodium (\( \text{Na} \)) = 23 g/mol
- Molar mass of chlorine gas (\( \text{Cl}_2 \)) = \( 2 \times 35.5 = 71 \) g/mol
- Molar mass of sodium chloride (\( \text{NaCl} \)) = 58.5 g/mol

#### Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant.
First, we find the number of moles of each reactant.
- Moles of sodium \( = \frac{40 \text{ g}}{23 \text{ g/mol}} = 1.739 \) moles
- Moles of chlorine gas \( = \frac{35.5 \text{ g}}{71 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.5 \) moles

From the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of chlorine gas. Plug in the moles to check for the limiting reactant.

The ratio of sodium to chlorine gas, according to the equation, should be 2:1. Our prepared moles have a ratio:
\[
\frac{1.739}{0.5} \approx 3.478
\]
This shows we have excess sodium. Therefore, chlorine gas is the limiting reactant.

#### Step 4: Calculate the amount of sodium chloride produced.
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of \( \text{Cl}_2 \) produces 2 moles of \( \text{"

In a slide caliper, the main scale of 19 divisions is equal to 20 divisions of the vernier scale. When a small rod is placed between its two jaws, it is observed that the zero mark of the vernier scale exceeds the 5.2 cm mark of the main scale. Furthermore, the 14th division of the vernier scale coincides with a division on the main scale. What is the vernier constant (in mm)?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Vernier Caliper Principle**:
   - The vernier caliper consists of a main scale and a vernier scale. 
   - The difference between one division of the main scale and one division of the vernier scale is called the least count or vernier constant.

2. **Translating the Given Information**:
   - 19 divisions of the main scale = 20 divisions of the vernier scale.
   - Thus, \( 1 \) main scale division (MSD) = \( \frac{20}{19} \) vernier scale division (VSD).

3. **Calculating Vernier Constant**:
   - Vernier constant (V.C.) or least count is given by:
     \[
     \text{V.C.} = 1 \text{ MSD} - 1 \text{ VSD}
     \]
   - If the value of 1 MSD = 1 mm (since 5.2 cm implies the scale is in cm, MSD in mm), then:
     \[
     1 \text{ VSD} = \frac{19}{20} \text{ msd (using proportionality)}
     \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \[
   \text{V.C.} = 1 \text{ mm} - \frac{19}{20} \text{ mm}
   \]
   - \[
   \text{V.C.} = \frac{20 - 19}{20} \text{ mm}
   \]
   - \[
   \text{V.C.} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ mm} = 0.05 \text{ mm}

The radius of a circle is 7 cm. What is the measure of the central angle of an arc that is 14 cm long?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the central angle (in degrees) that corresponds to an arc of length 14 cm in a circle with a radius of 7 cm.

1. **Understand the Formula**:
   The length of an arc (L) in a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   L = r \theta
   \]
   where:
   - \( L \) is the arc length,
   - \( r \) is the radius of the circle,
   - \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

2. **Substitute Known Values**:
   In our problem, we are given:
   - \( L = 14 \) cm (arc length),
   - \( r = 7 \) cm (radius).

   Substituting these into the formula, we get:
   \[
   14 = 7 \theta
   \]

3. **Solve for \(\theta\)**:
   To find \(\theta\), divide both sides of the equation by 7:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{14}{7} = 2 \text{ radians}
   \]

4. **Convert Radians to Degrees**:
   We need the central angle in degrees. The conversion factor from radians to degrees is \( \frac{180}{\pi} \).

   Therefore, convert \(\theta = 2\) radians to degrees:
   \[
   \theta = 2 \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 2 \times 57.2958 \approx 114.592 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Round the Answer**:
   We typically round to the nearest whole number unless specified otherwise. So, the angle is approximately 115 degrees.

In a reaction, 56 grams of caustic potash is dissolved in 0.5 liters of solution. What is the mass of the salt produced in the reaction?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Chemical Reaction**:
   - The term ""caustic potash"" refers to potassium hydroxide, KOH.
   - We assume a typical neutralization reaction where KOH reacts with an acid (often represented in these problems, e.g., HCl producing KCl and water) to produce a salt and water.

2. **Set Up the Reaction Equation**:
   - For simplicity, assume the acid is HCl (hydrochloric acid), which is a common scenario in these types of problems:
     \[
     \text{KOH} + \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{KCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
     \]
   - This reaction is balanced with 1 mole of KOH reacting with 1 mole of HCl to produce 1 mole of KCl and 1 mole of water.

3. **Calculate the Moles of KOH**:
   - Molar mass of KOH = 39 (K) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 56 g/mol.
   - Given mass of KOH = 56 grams, hence moles of KOH = 56 g / 56 g/mol = 1 mole.

What is the mass of water attached to one molecule of mulberry?

### Solution:
First, we need to clarify the problem because ""mulberry"" itself is not a specific chemical compound; it is a type of fruit. Typically, when we refer to a molecule associated with a fruit like a mulberry, we might be discussing a specific compound found in it, such as a sugar or enzyme.

Since the problem is likely focused on basic chemistry principles, we will assume the question is asking about a common sugar that could be associated with such a fruit. One relevant suggestion is to consider a compound like glucose, which is a simple sugar that could be present in mulberries.

The chemical formula for glucose, a common sugar, is C₆H₁₂O₆. However, the question might be about a hydrated form of a compound (such as hydrated glucose) where water molecules are attached.

1. **Identify the correct compound**: 
   - Assuming we are considering a hydrated form of glucose (such as a monohydrate), this would be glucose with water molecules associated, typically noted as C₆H₁₂O₆ · H₂O.
   
2. **Calculate the mass of water**:
   - The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately:
     - Hydrogen (H) has a molar mass of ~1 g/mol and there are 2 hydrogens, so 2 g/mol
     - Oxygen (O) has a molar mass of ~16 g/mol
     - Total molar mass for H₂O = 2 + 16 = 18 g/mol

3. **The scenario assumes a specific compound**:
   - If we assume the compound in question is something like glucose monohydrate, then this would involve one water molecule per ""molecule"" of this compound.

Thus, the mass of water attached per molecule of this compound would be the mass of one water molecule.

The problem states: ""What is the number of atoms in one molecule of ferric carbonate?""

### Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we first need to identify the chemical formula of ferric carbonate and then count the number of atoms in one molecule of that compound.

1. **Identify the Chemical Formula for Ferric Carbonate:**

   Ferric carbonate is composed of iron (Fe), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). The term ""ferric"" indicates that the iron is in the +3 oxidation state. The chemical formula for ferric carbonate is \( \text{Fe}_2(\text{CO}_3)_3 \).

2. **Understanding the Composition:**

   The molecular formula \( \text{Fe}_2(\text{CO}_3)_3 \) tells us the following:
   
   - There are 2 iron (Fe) atoms.
   - There are 3 carbonate (\(\text{CO}_3\)) groups.
   - Each \(\text{CO}_3\) group contains 1 carbon (C) atom and 3 oxygen (O) atoms.
   
3. **Counting the Atoms:**

   - **Iron Atoms**: There are 2 Fe atoms in one molecule of ferric carbonate.
   
   - **Carbon Atoms**: Since there are 3 \(\text{CO}_3\) groups and each contains 1 C atom, there will be \(3 \times 1 = 3\) carbon atoms.
   
   - **Oxygen Atoms**: Since each \(\text{CO}_3\) group contains 3 O atoms, the total number of oxygen atoms will be \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

4. **Total Number of Atoms:**

   To find the total number of atoms in one molecule of ferric carbonate, we sum up the atoms of each type:

   \[
   \text{Total atoms} = 2 \,\text{(Fe atoms)} + 3 \,\text{(C atoms)} + 9 \,\text{(O atoms)} = 14 \,\text{atoms}

A rectangular solid has a length of 5 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the length of its diagonal?

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve for the diagonal of a rectangular solid, also known as a rectangular prism, we use the formula for the space diagonal, which is based on the Pythagorean theorem extended into three dimensions. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular prism is:

\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
\]

where \(l\), \(w\), and \(h\) are the length, width, and height of the solid, respectively.

### Given:
- Length, \(l = 5\) cm
- Width, \(w = 5\) cm
- Height, \(h = 5\) cm

### Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2}
\]

### Calculate each squared term:
- \(5^2 = 25\)
- \(5^2 = 25\)
- \(5^2 = 25\)

### Add the squared terms:
\[
25 + 25 + 25 = 75
\]

### Take the square root:
\[
d = \sqrt{75}
\]

The square root of 75 can be simplified. Notice that \(75 = 25 \times 3\), which makes it:

\[
d = \sqrt{25 \times 3} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{3} = 5\sqrt{3}
\]

Thus, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid is \(5\sqrt{3}\) cm.

A stone is thrown upwards with a velocity of 9.8 m/s. After how much time will it return to the ground?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, we will use the principles of kinematics. The stone being thrown upwards and then returning to the ground is a classic example of a vertical motion problem under gravity.

### Step 1: Understanding Motion under Gravity
- Initial velocity (\(v_0\)) = 9.8 m/s (upwards)
- Final velocity (\(v\)) = 0 m/s (at the peak of its path, the velocity becomes 0)
- Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) = 9.8 m/s² (downwards)
- The motion can be divided into two parts: 
  1. Ascending to the highest point.
  2. Descending back to the ground.

### Step 2: Time to Reach the Highest Point
For the ascent, we use the first equation of motion:
\[ v = v_0 - gt \]

Setting the final velocity \( v = 0 \) at the highest point, the equation becomes:
\[ 0 = 9.8 - 9.8t_1 \]

Solving for \( t_1 \):
\[ 9.8t_1 = 9.8 \]

\[ t_1 = \frac{9.8}{9.8} = 1 \text{ second} \]

### Step 3: Total Time of Flight
The time to ascend to the highest point is equal to the time to descend back to the starting point. So, if it takes \( t_1 = 1 \) second to go up, it will also take 1 second to come back down.

Total time (\(T\)) for the upward and downward journey:
\[ T = t_1 + t_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the stone will return to the ground after 2 seconds.

### Conclusion
The stone will return to the ground after a total time of 2 seconds.

The problem in Bengali is asking: 

""What is the cardinality (number of elements) of the power set of the set \( A = \{3, 4, 5, 8\} \?""

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We need to find the cardinality of the power set of a given set \( A = \{3, 4, 5, 8\} \). The power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets, including the empty set and the set itself.

2. **Formula for the Power Set:**
   If a set has \( n \) elements, then the number of elements in its power set is \( 2^n \). This is because each element has two choices: it can either be included in a subset or not be included.

3. **Identify \( n \) for Set \( A \):**
   Here, set \( A \) has four elements: \{3, 4, 5, 8\}. So, \( n = 4 \).

4. **Calculate the Cardinality:**
   Apply the formula for the power set: 
   \[
   \text{Number of elements in the power set of } A = 2^n = 2^4 = 16
   \]

5. **Verify the Understanding:**
   Let's verify by listing a few subsets:
   - Empty set: \(\emptyset\)
   - Single element subsets: \(\{3\}, \{4\}, \{5\}, \{8\}\)
   - Two element subsets: \(\{3, 4\}, \{3, 5\}, \{3, 8\}, \{4, 5\}, \{4, 8\}, \{5, 8\}\)
   - Three element subsets: \(\{3, 4, 5\}, \{3, 4, 8\}, \{3, 5, 8\}, \{4, 5, 8\}\)
   - The entire set: \(\{3, 4, 5, 8\}\)

   Adding these up, indeed there are 16 subsets, corroborating that the power set has 16 elements.

What is the ratio of the circumference to the radius of a circle with a radius of 20 meters?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio of the circumference (C) of a circle to its radius (r). Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Formula for Circumference of a Circle:**
   \[
   C = 2\pi r
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius of the circle, and \(\pi\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

2. **Given Information:**
   The radius \(r\) is given as 20 meters.

3. **Calculate the Circumference:**
   Using the formula for the circumference:
   \[
   C = 2\pi \times 20
   \]
   \[
   C = 40\pi
   \]

4. **Formulate the Ratio:**
   We need the ratio of the circumference \(C\) to the radius \(r\).Thus:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{C}{r} = \frac{40\pi}{20}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Ratio:**
   Simplifying the ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 20:
   \[
   \frac{40\pi}{20} = 2\pi
   \]

   Since \(\pi\) is a constant, we can express the ratio simply as:
   - The ratio is \(2\pi:1\), or simply, \(2\pi\).

Therefore, the ratio of the circumference to the radius of the circle is \(2\pi\).

A solid metal sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 1 cm. What is the total surface area of the created cylinder in square centimeters?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere
The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
For the sphere with a radius (\( r \)) of 3 cm, the volume is:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36\pi \text{ cubic centimeters}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Dimensions of the Cylinder
When melted, the sphere's material will occupy the same volume as the cylinder. Hence, the volume of the cylinder is also \( 36\pi \) cubic centimeters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Given that the radius \( r \) of the cylinder is 1 cm:
\[
36\pi = \pi (1)^2 h \implies 36\pi = \pi h \implies h = 36 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Surface Area of the Cylinder
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
A = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2
\]
where \( 2\pi r h \) is the lateral surface area and \( 2\pi r^2 \) accounts for the area of the two circular ends.

Substituting the known values (\( r = 1 \) cm, \( h = 36 \) cm):
\[
A = 2\pi \times 1 \times 36 + 2\pi \times 1^2 = 72\pi + 2\pi = 74\pi \text{ square centimeters}
\]

### Conclusion
The total surface area of the cylinder formed is \( 74\pi \) square centimeters.

How many grams of sodium chloride should be added to a 2-liter solution to make it semi-molar?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we start by defining what semi-molar means. A semi-molar solution is one that has a concentration of 0.5 moles per liter. We need to determine how many grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) are required to achieve this concentration in a 2-liter solution.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Molar Concentration:**
   - Since we need a semi-molar solution, the molarity \( M \) is 0.5 moles/liter.

2. **Determine the Total Moles Required:**
   - We have a 2-liter solution, so the total moles of NaCl required can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total moles required} = 0.5 \, \text{moles/liter} \times 2 \, \text{liters} = 1 \, \text{mole}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Molar Mass of Sodium Chloride (NaCl):**
   - The molar mass of NaCl is the sum of the atomic masses of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl).
   - Atomic mass of Na = 23 g/mol
   - Atomic mass of Cl = 35.5 g/mol
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of NaCl} = 23 \, \text{g/mol} + 35.5 \, \text{g/mol} = 58.5 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Mass of NaCl Required:**
   - To find out how many grams of NaCl are needed to have 1 mole, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass:
   \[
   \text{Mass of NaCl required} = 1 \, \text{mole} \times 58.5 \, \text{g/mol} = 58.5 \, \text{grams}

A cow is tied with a rope in such a way that it can graze on a circular field of 144 square meters. What is the radius of the field in meters?

### Step 2: Provide a Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To find the radius of the circular field, we need to understand the relationship between the area of a circle and its radius. The formula for the area \(A\) of a circle is given by:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

In this problem, we know that the area of the circular field is \(144\) square meters. We can substitute this value into the formula and solve for the radius \(r\).

\[
144 = \pi r^2
\]

To isolate \(r^2\), divide both sides by \(\pi\):

\[
r^2 = \frac{144}{\pi}
\]

Next, solve for \(r\) by taking the square root of both sides:

\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{144}{\pi}}
\]

Since \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), we can estimate:

\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{144}{3.14159}} \approx \sqrt{45.8366}
\]

Calculate the square root:

\[
r \approx 6.76
\]

Thus, the radius of the circular field is approximately \(6.76\) meters.

A gun with a mass of 5 kg fires a bullet with a mass of 20 grams at a velocity of 500 m/s over a duration of 0.1 seconds. What is the magnitude of the force exerted on the bullet by the gun?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we'll utilize Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force exerted on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. This can be mathematically expressed as:

\[ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( \Delta p \) is the change in momentum, and \( \Delta t \) is the change in time.

**Step 1: Calculate the Change in Momentum (\( \Delta p \))**

The momentum of an object is given by the product of its mass and velocity. Therefore, the initial momentum (\( p_{\text{initial}} \)) and the final momentum (\( p_{\text{final}} \)) of the bullet can be calculated as follows:

- **Initial Momentum, \( p_{\text{initial}} \):**

Before the bullet is fired, its velocity is 0. Thus, the initial momentum is:

\[ p_{\text{initial}} = m \cdot v_{\text{initial}} = 0 \]

- **Final Momentum, \( p_{\text{final}} \):**

After being fired, the bullet acquires a velocity of 500 m/s. Hence, the final momentum is:

\[ p_{\text{final}} = m \cdot v_{\text{final}} = 0.02 \, \text{kg} \cdot 500 \, \text{m/s} \]

(Note: Convert the mass of the bullet from grams to kilograms: 20 grams = 0.02 kg)

\[ p_{\text{final}} = 10 \, \text{kg m/s} \]

- **Change in Momentum, \( \Delta p \):**

The change in momentum (\( \Delta p \)) is:

\[ \Delta p = p_{\text{final}} - p_{\text{initial}} = 10 \, \text{kg m/s} - 0 \]

\[ \Delta p = 10 \, \text{kg m/s} \]

The problem is: ""How many grams of oxygen will react with 12 grams of magnesium?""

## Step 2: Solution with detailed explanations

To solve this problem, we must first understand the chemical reaction that takes place between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O₂) to form magnesium oxide (MgO). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:

\[ 2 \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO} \]

From this equation, we see that 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen to form 2 moles of magnesium oxide.

Next, we need the molar masses of the substances involved:
- The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24 grams/mole.
- The molar mass of oxygen (O₂) is approximately 32 grams/mole.

### Part A: Calculate moles of magnesium
First, calculate the number of moles of magnesium we have:

\[
\text{Moles of Mg} = \frac{\text{mass of Mg}}{\text{molar mass of Mg}} = \frac{12 \text{ grams}}{24 \text{ grams/mole}} = 0.5 \text{ moles of Mg}
\]

### Part B: Determine moles of oxygen required
According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O₂. Therefore, 0.5 moles of Mg will react with:

\[
\text{Moles of } \text{O}_2 = \frac{0.5 \text{ moles of Mg}}{2} = 0.25 \text{ moles of O}_2
\]

### Part C: Calculate mass of oxygen required
Finally, calculate the mass of 0.25 moles of oxygen required:

\[
\text{Mass of O}_2 = \text{moles of O}_2 \times \text{molar mass of O}_2 = 0.25 \text{ moles} \times 32 \text{ grams/mole} = 8 \text{ grams}
\]

Therefore, 12 grams of magnesium will react with 8 grams of oxygen.

### Step-by-Step Solution
To find the area of the square, we need to first determine the side length of the square using the given diagonal length.

1. **Understand the Relationship between the Diagonal and the Side of a Square:**

   For a square with side length \( s \), the diagonal \( d \) is related to the side length by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   d = s\sqrt{2}
   \]

   Given:
   \[
   d = 4\sqrt{2} \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Solve for the Side Length \( s \):**

   Using the relationship \( d = s\sqrt{2} \), substitute the given diagonal length:
   \[
   4\sqrt{2} = s\sqrt{2}
   \]

   Divide both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\) to solve for \( s \):
   \[
   s = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 4 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Area of the Square:**

   The area \( A \) of a square is given by the square of its side length:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]

   Substitute the side length we found:
   \[
   A = 4^2 = 16 \text{ square centimeters}

Therefore, the area of the square is \( 16 \) square centimeters.

To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Chemical Reaction**: The chemical reaction between potassium carbonate (\( \text{K}_2\text{CO}_3 \)) and hydrochloric acid (\( \text{HCl} \)) is:

   \[
   \text{K}_2\text{CO}_3 + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow 2\text{KCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_2
   \]

2. **Calculate the Moles of Potassium Carbonate**: We know the concentration (\(C\)) and volume (\(V\)) of the potassium carbonate solution:

   \[
   C = 0.125 \, \text{M} \quad \text{and} \quad V = 750 \, \text{ml} = 0.750 \, \text{L}

""If the mass of an atom of an element is \(4.482 \times 10^{-23}\) grams, what is its relative atomic mass?""

## Solution:

To find the relative atomic mass, we need to understand that the relative atomic mass of an element is a number that compares the average mass of an atom of that element to one-twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. By definition, the mass of one carbon-12 atom is approximately \(1.992647 \times 10^{-23}\) grams, and the relative atomic mass of carbon-12 is 12 atomic mass units (amu) by definition.

Let's proceed with the solution step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given mass of the atom of the element:**
   - The mass of an atom of the element is given as \(4.482 \times 10^{-23}\) grams.

2. **Relate this to carbon-12 standard:**
   - A carbon-12 atom has a mass of approximately \(1.992647 \times 10^{-23}\) grams.

3. **Understand the relationship:**
   - The relative atomic mass (A) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{\text{Mass of atom of element}}{\text{Mass of \(1/12\)th of a carbon-12 atom}}
     \]

4. **Calculate the relative atomic mass:**
   - Given that \(1/12\) of the mass of a carbon-12 atom is equal to the atomic mass unit (amu), we equate:
     \[
     \text{amu} = 1.660539 \times 10^{-24} \text{ grams}
     \]
   - Substitute the given values into the equation:
     \[
     A = \frac{4.482 \times 10^{-23} \text{ grams}}{1.660539 \times 10^{-24} \text{ grams/amu}}
     \]

5. **Perform the calculation:**
   - Simplifying the above expression:
     \[
     A = \frac{4.482}{1.660539} \times 10^{1} \text{ amu}

   The impulse \( J \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   J = F \times t
   \]
   where \( F \) is the force applied, and \( t \) is the time duration for which the force is applied.

   Here, 
   \[
   F = 1500 \, \text{Newton (N)}
   \]
   \[
   t = 0.15 \, \text{seconds (s)}
   \]

   Plug these values into the impulse formula:
   \[
   J = 1500 \, \text{N} \times 0.15 \, \text{s} = 225 \, \text{N}\cdot\text{s}
   \]

   The impulse (J), measured in Newton-seconds, is also the change in momentum (\(\Delta p\)) of the object. Thus, the change in momentum is:
   \[
   \Delta p = 225 \, \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   The change in momentum of the object is 225 kg-m/s.

A spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half submerged and floating in water. What is the density of the sphere in kg/m³?

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of buoyancy and how it applies to the floating sphere. The key principle here is Archimedes' Principle, which states that a body fully or partially submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Volume of the sphere, \( V_{\text{sphere}} = 200 \, \text{m}^3 \).
   - The sphere is half-submerged, meaning it displaces water equal to half of its volume.
   - The density of water is approximately \( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).

2. **Determine the Volume of Water Displaced:**
   - Since the sphere is half submerged, the volume of water displaced is:
     \[
     V_{\text{displaced}} = \frac{1}{2} \times V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \, \text{m}^3 = 100 \, \text{m}^3
     \]

3. **Calculate the Weight of Water Displaced:**
   - The weight of the water displaced (which is equal to the buoyant force) is given by:
     \[
     W_{\text{displaced}} = \text{Density of water} \times V_{\text{displaced}} \times g
     \]
   - Here, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). However, we're primarily interested in the mass equivalent, so we'll drop \( g \) for simplification without losing generality:
     \[
     \text{Mass of water displaced} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 100 \, \text{m}^3 = 100,000 \, \text{kg}
     \]

4. **Apply Archimedes' Principle:**
   - According to Archimedes' Principle, the weight of the sphere is equal to the weight of the volume of water displaced when the sphere is half submerged. Hence:

     \]
   - This formula arises from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by two sides and the diagonal of the square.

3. **Using the Given Diagonal Length:**
   - We're given that the diagonal \(d = 8\sqrt{2}\) cm.
   - Substitute the diagonal value into the formula:
     \[
     8\sqrt{2} = s\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Solving for the Side Length \(s\):**
   - To find \(s\), divide both sides of the equation by \(\sqrt{2}\):
     \[
     s = \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, the side length of the square is 8 cm.

5. **Calculating the Area:**

A sound wave has a period of \(5.8 \times 10^{-4}\) seconds and a speed of 320 m/s. What is the wavelength in meters?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a wave, we can use the basic wave relationship:

\[
\text{Speed of the wave} = \text{Wavelength} \times \text{Frequency}
\]

Rearranged, this relationship is:

\[
\text{Wavelength} = \frac{\text{Speed of the wave}}{\text{Frequency}}
\]

The frequency (\(f\)) of a wave is the reciprocal of its period (\(T\)). Thus, we have:

\[
f = \frac{1}{T}
\]

Given:
- Period, \(T = 5.8 \times 10^{-4}\) seconds
- Speed of sound, \(v = 320\) m/s

First, calculate the frequency:

\[
f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{5.8 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1724.14 \text{ Hz}
\]

Now calculate the wavelength using the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{320}{1724.14} \approx 0.1856 \text{ meters}
\]

Thus, the wavelength of the sound wave is approximately 0.1856 meters.

   A circle with a diameter of 2 cm has an arc that subtends an angle of 90 degrees at the center. What is the approximate length of this arc in centimeters?

2. **Step-by-step solution:**

   To find the length of the arc in a circle when the central angle is given, we can use the formula for the arc length:
   
   \[
   \text{Arc length} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r
   \]

   where \(\theta\) is the angle in degrees, and \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

   **Step 1:** Determine the radius of the circle.
   
   Given that the diameter of the circle is 2 cm, the radius \(r\) is half of the diameter.
   \[
   r = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ cm}
   \]

   **Step 2:** Use the arc length formula.

   Substitute \(\theta = 90^\circ\) and \(r = 1 \text{ cm}\) into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Arc length} = \frac{90}{360} \times 2\pi \times 1

   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{Arc length} = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

   **Step 3:** Approximate the arc length.

   Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
   \[
   \text{Arc length} \approx \frac{3.1416}{2} \approx 1.5708

To make the kinetic energy of an object 16 times, by how many times must the velocity be increased?

## Step-by-step Solution:
The problem requires us to understand the relationship between kinetic energy and velocity. The formula for the kinetic energy (\(KE\)) of an object is given by:

\[ KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the object,
- \( v \) is the velocity of the object.

1. **Understanding the Relationship**:
   - Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the velocity. This means if velocity increases, kinetic energy increases by the square of that factor.

2. **Establishing the Initial Condition**:
   - Suppose the initial velocity of the object is \( v_1 \), then the initial kinetic energy is:
     \[ KE_1 = \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 \]

3. **The Final Condition**:
   - Let the new velocity be \( v_2 \). According to the problem, the kinetic energy becomes 16 times the initial kinetic energy. Therefore, the new kinetic energy (\( KE_2 \)) is:
     \[ KE_2 = 16 \times KE_1 = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 \]

4. **Express the Final Kinetic Energy**:
   - From the kinetic energy formula, substitute for the final velocity:
     \[ KE_2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 \]

5. **Equating the Expressions for KE**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2
   \]

   Cancel out the common terms (\(\frac{1}{2} m\)) from both sides:

   \[
   v_2^2 = 16 \times v_1^2
   \]

6. **Solving for \( v_2 \)**:
   \[
   v_2 = \sqrt{16} \times v_1
   \]

7. **Calculate the Factor for Velocity**:
   \[
   v_2 = 4 \times v_1

Using a slide caliper, the main scale reading for measuring the thickness of a rectangular glass plate is 18 mm, and the Vernier coincidence is 8. If the Vernier constant of the instrument is 0.01 cm, what is the thickness in mm?

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Understand the measurement components:**
   - The main scale reading (MSR) is given as 18 mm.
   - The Vernier coincidence (VC) is given as 8.
   - The Vernier constant (VC) is given as 0.01 cm.

2. **Convert the Vernier constant to millimeters:**
   - Given that 1 cm = 10 mm, the Vernier constant in mm is:
     \[
     0.01 \text{ cm} = 0.01 \times 10 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ mm}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Vernier scale reading (VSR):**
   - This is determined by multiplying the Vernier coincidence by the Vernier constant (already converted into mm):

   According to the report from the meteorological department, it rained for 19 days in September. What is the probability that it rained on the 8th of September?

2. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   To determine the probability of an event, we use the following formula:

   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
   \]

   In this problem, we are trying to find the likelihood that it rained on the 8th of September, given that it rained for a total of 19 days in September.

   - **Total number of days in September:** 30
   - **Number of days it rained:** 19

   The condition provided does not give specific information about which particular days it rained, just that it rained on a total of 19 days. Therefore, without explicit information about specific days such as the 8th, one common method to calculate this would be to assume a uniform distribution of the 19 rainy days across the month unless additional information is provided.

   Now, calculate the probability:

   Since each of the 30 days could equally likely be a rainy day, and there are 19 rainy days,

   \[
   \text{Probability of rain on the 8th} = \frac{19}{30}
   \]

Two objects weighing 15 kg and 10 kg are coming from opposite directions on the same road at speeds of 3 m/s and 5 m/s respectively. They collide head-on and stick together. What is their combined speed in m/s after the collision?

## Detailed Solution:
To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision, assuming no external forces act on the system.

1. **Determine the momentum of each object before the collision:**

   - The momentum of an object is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Momentum} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Velocity}
     \]

2. **Calculate the momentum of the 15 kg object:**

   - Mass = 15 kg
   - Velocity = 3 m/s (since it is traveling in the opposite direction we can consider it positive)
   - Momentum = 15 kg × 3 m/s = 45 kg·m/s

3. **Calculate the momentum of the 10 kg object:**

   - Mass = 10 kg
   - Velocity = -5 m/s (this is considered negative as it is moving in the opposite direction to the first object)
   - Momentum = 10 kg × (-5 m/s) = -50 kg·m/s

4. **Calculate the total momentum before the collision:**

   Total momentum before collision = Momentum of 15 kg object + Momentum of 10 kg object
   \[
   = 45 \text{ kg·m/s} + (-50 \text{ kg·m/s}) = -5 \text{ kg·m/s}
   \]

5. **Determine the total mass after the collision:**

   As the objects stick together, their combined mass is simply the sum of their individual masses:
   \[
   \text{Total Mass} = 15 \text{ kg} + 10 \text{ kg} = 25 \text{ kg}
   \]

6. **Calculate the velocity after the collision:**

   Let \(v\) be the velocity after the collision. By the conservation of momentum:
   \[
   (\text{Total mass}) \times v = \text{Total momentum before the collision}

A stationary object with a mass of 2 kg is dropped from above and travels a distance of 36 meters in 3 seconds. What is the acceleration of the object in m/s²?

## Detailed Solution:

To find the acceleration of the object, we can use the equation of motion for constant acceleration, which is:

\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

Where:
- \( s \) is the displacement (36 meters, in this case).
- \( u \) is the initial velocity (since the object is dropped and starts from rest, \( u = 0 \) m/s).
- \( a \) is the acceleration.
- \( t \) is the time (3 seconds).

Since the object starts from rest, we can substitute \( u = 0 \) into the equation:

\[ s = 0 \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

Now, substitute the given values into the equation:

\[ 36 = \frac{1}{2} a (3^2) \]

\[ 36 = \frac{1}{2} a \cdot 9 \]

\[ 36 = \frac{9}{2} a \]

To find \( a \), we rearrange the equation:

\[ a = \frac{36 \cdot 2}{9} \]

\[ a = \frac{72}{9} \]

\[ a = 8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]

Thus, the acceleration of the object is \( 8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

**English:** What is the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid?

## Solution
Chloric acid is a chemical compound with the formula \( HClO_3 \). To find the percentage of oxygen in this compound, we need to determine the molecular weight of each element in the compound and calculate the proportion that oxygen contributes.

1. **Determine the atomic weights**:
   - Hydrogen (H): approximately 1 gram/mole
   - Chlorine (Cl): approximately 35.5 grams/mole
   - Oxygen (O): approximately 16 grams/mole

2. **Calculate the molecular weight of chloric acid (\(HClO_3\))**:
   - Molecular weight of \(HClO_3\) = \(1\) (H) + \(35.5\) (Cl) + \(3 \times 16\) (O)
   - = \(1 + 35.5 + 48\)
   - = \(84.5\) grams/mole

3. **Calculate the total mass contributed by the oxygen atoms**:
   - There are 3 oxygen atoms in chloric acid.
   - Total mass of oxygen = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) grams/mole

4. **Calculate the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid**:
   - Percentage of oxygen = \(\left(\frac{\text{Total mass of oxygen}}{\text{Molecular weight of } HClO_3}\right) \times 100\)
   - = \(\left(\frac{48}{84.5}\right) \times 100\)
   - \(\approx 56.80\%\)

Therefore, the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid is approximately 56.80%.

In a right-angled triangle, the base and the hypotenuse are 12 and 13, respectively. What is the length of the perpendicular side (height)?

## Detailed Solution:
To solve this problem, we will apply the Pythagorean theorem, which is applicable in right-angled triangles. The theorem states:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two legs (base and perpendicular), and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse.

Here, we are given:
- The base (\(a\)) = 12
- The hypotenuse (\(c\)) = 13

We need to find the perpendicular (\(b\)).

### Step-by-step Calculation:
1. Plug the given values into the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   12^2 + b^2 = 13^2
   \]

2. Calculate the squares:
   \[
   144 + b^2 = 169
   \]

3. Subtract 144 from both sides to solve for \(b^2\):
   \[
   b^2 = 169 - 144
   \]

4. Perform the subtraction:
   \[
   b^2 = 25
   \]

5. Take the square root of both sides to find \(b\):
   \[
   b = \sqrt{25} = 5

A stationary object with a mass of 2 kg is dropped from above and covers a distance of 36 meters in 3 seconds. What will be the velocity of the object after 3 seconds in m/s?

## Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we will use the equations of motion under the influence of gravity. We will assume that the only force acting on the object is gravity and air resistance is negligible. The acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) is approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

### Given:
- Initial velocity (\(u\)) = \(0 \, \text{m/s}\) (since the object is dropped)
- Time (\(t\)) = \(3 \, \text{s}\)
- Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) = \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)
- Distance covered (\(s\)) = \(36 \, \text{m}\)

### Step 1: Verify Distance Using the First Equation of Motion
The first equation of motion for uniformly accelerated motion is:
\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ s = 0 \cdot 3 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.8 \cdot 3^2 \]
\[ s = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.8 \cdot 9 \]
\[ s = 44.1 \, \text{m} \]

However, the problem states the object covers 36 meters, less than our computed 44.1 meters.

Thus, we should primarily calculate the velocity after 3 seconds without verifying this discrepancy with distance, assuming solely acceleration from gravity affects calculation for velocity.

### Step 2: Calculate the Final Velocity Using the Second Equation of Motion
The second equation of motion for uniformly accelerated motion is:
\[ v = u + gt \]

where 
\(v\) is the final velocity.

Substituting the given values:
\[ v = 0 + 9.8 \cdot 3 \]
\[ v = 29.4 \, \text{m/s} \]

Therefore, the velocity of the object after 3 seconds is \(29.4 \, \text{m/s}\).

The problem asks: ""What is 54 kilometers per hour in meters per second?""

## Solution:

To convert speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s), we need to use the conversion factors between the units. 

1. **Understand the Conversion Factors:**
   - 1 kilometer (km) is equal to 1000 meters (m).
   - 1 hour equals 3600 seconds.

2. **Conversion Process:**
   - We start by converting kilometers to meters. Since 1 km = 1000 m, 54 km equals:
     \[
     54 \text{ km} \times 1000 \text{ m/km} = 54000 \text{ m}
     \]

   - Next, we convert hours to seconds. Since 1 hour = 3600 seconds, we have:
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate Meters per Second:**
   - Now, convert 54 km/h to m/s by dividing the number of meters by the number of seconds in an hour:
     \[
     \frac{54000 \text{ meters}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} = 15 \text{ m/s}
     \]

Thus, 54 kilometers per hour is equivalent to 15 meters per second.

What is the number of proper subsets for a set with 3 elements?

## Step-by-step Solution:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand what a proper subset is. A proper subset of a set is a subset that contains some, but not all, elements of the original set. This means that the set itself is not considered a proper subset.

1. **Calculate Total Number of Subsets:**
   - If a set has \( n \) elements, then it has \( 2^n \) total subsets. 
   - This includes the empty subset and the set itself.

2. **Calculate Total Number of Subsets for a Set with 3 Elements:**
   - Here, \( n = 3 \).
   - Total subsets = \( 2^3 = 8 \).

3. **Calculate Number of Proper Subsets:**
   - Proper subsets are all the subsets except the entire set itself.
   - Thus, the number of proper subsets = Total subsets - 1 (the set itself).
   - Number of proper subsets = 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, a set with 3 elements has 7 proper subsets.

In a basket, there are 15 white balls, 10 black balls, and 20 red balls. A ball is drawn randomly. What is the probability that the ball is either white or red?

## Solution:
To find the probability that the ball drawn is either white or red, we first need to determine the total number of balls and then calculate the favorable outcomes.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of balls.
- White balls = 15
- Black balls = 10
- Red balls = 20

Total number of balls = White balls + Black balls + Red balls  
\[ = 15 + 10 + 20 = 45 \]

### Step 2: Determine the favorable outcomes.
The favorable outcomes are the number of white balls plus the number of red balls because we are interested in the ball being either white or red.

- Number of white balls = 15
- Number of red balls = 20

Total favorable outcomes (white or red balls) = White balls + Red balls  
\[ = 15 + 20 = 35 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability.
The probability \( P \) of drawing a white or red ball is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

\[ P(\text{white or red}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes (white or red balls)}}{\text{Total number of balls}} \]

\[ P(\text{white or red}) = \frac{35}{45} \]

### Step 4: Simplify the probability.
We can simplify the fraction \(\frac{35}{45}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 5.

\[ \frac{35}{45} = \frac{35 \div 5}{45 \div 5} = \frac{7}{9} \]

Thus, the probability that the randomly drawn ball is either white or red is \(\frac{7}{9}\).

A spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half-submerged in water. What is the buoyant force on the sphere?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

### Understanding the Problem
- We have a sphere with a total volume of 200 cubic meters.
- The sphere is half-submerged, meaning that half of its volume is under the water.
- We need to calculate the buoyant force acting on the sphere.

### Principles Involved
- **Archimedes' Principle:** The buoyant force on a body submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.

### Steps:
1. **Calculate the Volume of Water Displaced:**
   - Since the sphere is half-submerged, the volume of water displaced is half the volume of the sphere.
   - Volume of water displaced = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \, \text{m}^3 = 100 \, \text{m}^3 \)

2. **Calculate the Buoyant Force:**
   - The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced water.
   - Density of water (approximate) = \( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
   - Volume of displaced water = 100 m\(^3\)
   - Mass of displaced water = Volume \(\times\) Density = \( 100 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 = 100000 \, \text{kg} \)
   - Weight of the displaced water (using \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)):

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the molecular mass of methane and then calculate the total mass for 12 moles of it.

### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula of Methane
Methane (CH₄) consists of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Mass of Methane
- The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12 g/mol.
- The atomic mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 g/mol.

The molecular mass of methane is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Molecular mass of } \text{CH}_4 = (1 \times \text{atomic mass of C}) + (4 \times \text{atomic mass of H})
\]
\[
= (1 \times 12 \, \text{g/mol}) + (4 \times 1 \, \text{g/mol})
\]
\[
= 12 \, \text{g/mol} + 4 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
\[
= 16 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Mass of 12 Moles of Methane
Once we have the molecular mass, the total mass for 12 moles of methane can be calculated by multiplying the molecular mass by the number of moles.
\[
\text{Mass of 12 moles of } \text{CH}_4 = \text{molecular mass of CH}_4 \times \text{number of moles}

   - **Find the Molar Mass of Carbon Monoxide (\( \text{CO} \))**:

     Carbon monoxide (CO) is made up of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. We can find its molar mass by adding the molar masses of carbon and oxygen.

     - The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately \( 12.01 \, \text{g/mol} \).
     - The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately \( 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} \).

     \[
     \text{Molar mass of CO} = 12.01 \, \text{g/mol} + 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 28.01 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]

   - **Calculate the Mass of 9 Moles of CO**:

     Now that we have the molar mass of CO, we can calculate the mass of 9 moles.
