Find the smallest non-zero perfect square that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60. What is the number?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Find the LCM of the Given Numbers:**

   To solve this problem, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 25, 40, and 60. We achieve this by first determining the prime factorization of each number:
   
   \[
   25 = 5^2
   \]
   \[
   40 = 2^3 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5
   \]

   The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in any of the factorizations:
   
   - The highest power of 2 present is \( 2^3 \).
   - The highest power of 3 present is \( 3^1 \).
   - The highest power of 5 present is \( 5^2 \).

   Therefore, the LCM is:
   \[
   LCM = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 3 \times 25 = 600
   \]

2. **Determine the Smallest Perfect Square Divisible by the LCM:**

   The problem asks for the smallest non-zero perfect square that is divisible by the LCM, which we calculated as 600. For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even.

   The prime factorization of 600 is:
   \[
   600 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^2
   \]

   To convert \( 600 \) into a perfect square, we need to adjust the exponents to the next even integers:
   - For \( 2^3 \), increase the exponent to 4, i.e., \( 2^4 \).
   - For \( 3^1 \), increase the exponent to 2, i.e., \( 3^2 \).
   - \( 5^2 \) is already even.

   Thus, the smallest perfect square larger than or equal to the LCM of 600 is:

   \[
   \text{Adjusted LCM} = 2^4"

The product of two positive numbers is 98, and the larger number is 2 times the smaller number. What is the smaller number?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote the smaller number as \( x \).

According to the problem, the larger number is \( 2x \).

The product of these two numbers is given as:

\[
x \times 2x = 98
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
2x^2 = 98
\]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:

\[
x^2 = \frac{98}{2}
\]

\[
x^2 = 49
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
x = \sqrt{49}
\]

\[
x = 7
\]

Therefore, the smaller number is 7.

   A shopkeeper buys cloth at the rate of 125 Taka per meter and sells it at the rate of 150 Taka per meter. The shopkeeper makes a profit of 2000 Taka. How many meters of cloth did the shopkeeper buy in total?

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

   To find out how many meters of cloth the shopkeeper bought, we can first determine the profit made per meter of cloth sold.

   - The cost price per meter (CP) = 125 Taka
   - The selling price per meter (SP) = 150 Taka

   The profit per meter of cloth is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Profit per meter} = \text{SP} - \text{CP} = 150 - 125 = 25 \text{ Taka}
   \]

   The shopkeeper's total profit is given as 2000 Taka. Now, we need to determine the total number of meters of cloth he sold to achieve this total profit.

   Let's denote the total meters of cloth sold as \( x \).

   The total profit made can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = \text{Profit per meter} \times \text{Total meters sold}
   \]

   So, we have:
   \[
   25x = 2000
   \]

   Solving for \( x \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{2000}{25}
   \]
   \[
   x = 80
   \]

   Thus, the shopkeeper bought and sold 80 meters of cloth to make a profit of 2000 Taka.

3. **Conclusion with the final numerical answer:**

   **Answer: 80**"

The problem given in Bengali is: ""৪২০ টাকা, ৫৬০ টাকা ও ৬৩০ টাকা  -এর গ.সা.গু _____ টাকা।""

Translated into English, it reads: ""The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 taka, 560 taka, and 630 taka is _____ taka.""

## Step-by-Step Solution

To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the given numbers, we follow these steps:

1. **List the prime factors** of each number.

    - **420**:
      - \( 420 \div 2 = 210 \)
      - \( 210 \div 2 = 105 \)
      - \( 105 \div 3 = 35 \)
      - \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)
      - \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)

      So, the prime factors of 420 are: \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \).

    - **560**:
      - \( 560 \div 2 = 280 \)
      - \( 280 \div 2 = 140 \)
      - \( 140 \div 2 = 70 \)
      - \( 70 \div 2 = 35 \)
      - \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)
      - \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)

      So, the prime factors of 560 are: \( 2^4 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \).

    - **630**:
      - \( 630 \div 2 = 315 \)
      - \( 315 \div 3 = 105 \)
      - \( 105 \div 3 = 35 \)
      - \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)
      - \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)

      So, the prime factors of 630 are: \( 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \).

2. **Identify the common prime factors** and their smallest powers.

    The common prime factors among 420, 560, and 630 are \( 2 \), \( 5 \), and \( 7 \).

    - For \( 2 \), the"

A square field has a side length of \( \frac{5}{2} \) km. The area of the field is _____ square km.

## Solution

To find the area of a square when given the length of its side, we use the formula for the area of a square:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side}^2
\]

Here, the side length of the square is given as \( \frac{5}{2} \) km. We substitute this value into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2

Five years ago, the ratio of the ages of a father and his son was 3:1, and after 15 years, the ratio of their ages will be 2:1. What is the current age of the son?

## Step-by-Step Solution in English:

To solve this problem, we need to establish equations based on the given age ratios and solve them to find the present age of the son.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the current age of the father be \( F \).
- Let the current age of the son be \( S \).

### Step 1: Analyze the situation from 5 years ago
Five years ago, the father's age was \( F - 5 \) and the son's age was \( S - 5 \). According to the problem, at that time, the age ratio was 3:1. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[
\frac{F - 5}{S - 5} = \frac{3}{1}
\]

Cross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction gives us:

\[
F - 5 = 3(S - 5)
\]

Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:

\[
F - 5 = 3S - 15
\]

\[
F = 3S - 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the situation 15 years from now
Fifteen years from now, the father's age will be \( F + 15 \) and the son's age will be \( S + 15 \). The problem states that the age ratio at that time will be 2:1. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[
\frac{F + 15}{S + 15} = \frac{2}{1}
\]

Cross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction gives us:

\[
F + 15 = 2(S + 15)
\]

Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:

\[
F + 15 = 2S + 30
\]

\[
F = 2S + 15 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

### Step 3: Solve the two equations
We have two linear equations from the above steps:

1. \( F = 3S - 10 \)
2. \( F = 2S + 15 \)

A goat was sold at a 10% loss. If the selling price was 450 Taka more, there would have been a 5% profit. What was the purchase price of the goat in Taka?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let the purchase price of the goat be \( x \) Taka.
   
2. **Selling at a 10% Loss**:
   - If the goat is sold at a 10% loss, the selling price is 90% of the purchase price.
   - Selling price at a 10% loss = \( 0.9x \).

3. **Condition for 5% Profit**:
   - The selling price needed for a 5% profit would be 105% of the purchase price.
   - Selling price for a 5% profit = \( 1.05x \).

4. **Given Condition**:
   - We are given that selling at a price 450 Taka more than the actual selling price would result in a 5% profit.
   - Therefore, \( 0.9x + 450 = 1.05x \).

5. **Solve the Equation**:
   - Rearrange the equation: \( 450 = 1.05x - 0.9x \).
   - \( 450 = 0.15x \).

6. **Calculate Purchase Price**:
   - Solving for \( x \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{450}{0.15} = 3000
   \]

Thus, the purchase price of the goat is **3000 Taka**.

A square field has a side length of 300 meters and there is a 4-meter wide road around it. Calculate the area of the road in square meters.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the side length of the outer square:**
   - The original square field has a side length of 300 meters.
   - There is a 4-meter wide road surrounding this field on all sides.
   - Therefore, the road adds 4 meters to each side of the field.
   - Thus, the total increase in length is 4 meters on each side, so the length increase is \(4 + 4 = 8\) meters.
   - Hence, the side length of the outer square (including the road) is:
     \[
     300 + 8 = 308 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the area of the outer square (including the road):**
   - The area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{side length}^2 \).
   - For the outer square, this becomes:
     \[
     308^2 = 94864 \text{ square meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of the original square field:**
   - Similarly, the area of the original square field is:
     \[
     300^2 = 90000 \text{ square meters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the area of the road:**
   - The area of the road is the difference between the area of the outer square and the area of the original field.
   - Thus, the area of the road is:
     \[
     94864 - 90000 = 4864 \text{ square meters}

Find the smallest two consecutive numbers whose squares have a difference that is a perfect square. Identify the smaller number.

### Detailed Solution:
We are tasked with finding two consecutive integers, say \(n\) and \(n+1\), such that the difference between their squares is a perfect square.

1. **Formulating the Problem:**
   \[
   (n+1)^2 - n^2 = \text{perfect square}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Difference:**
   \[
   (n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1
   \]
   Therefore, the difference between their squares is:
   \[
   (n^2 + 2n + 1) - n^2 = 2n + 1
   \]
   We need \(2n + 1\) to be a perfect square. Let \(2n + 1 = k^2\) where \(k\) is an integer.

3. **Solve for \(n\):**
   Rearranging gives us:
   \[
   2n = k^2 - 1
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{k^2 - 1}{2}
   \]

   For \(n\) to be an integer, \(k^2 - 1\) must be even, meaning \(k^2\) (which is always odd if \(k\) is odd) must be odd. Hence, \(k\) itself must be an odd integer.

4. **Find the Smallest \(n\):**
   The smallest odd \(k\) is 3.
   \[
   n = \frac{3^2 - 1}{2} = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

5. **Verification:**
   If \(n = 4\), then \(n+1 = 5\).
   \[
   5^2 - 4^2 = 25 - 16 = 9
   \]
   Since 9 is indeed a perfect square \( (3^2 = 9) \), this confirms that our process is correct.

### Conclusion:
The smallest number is thus 4.

A man saves 850 Taka every month. In which month will his total savings exceed 50,000 Taka?

## Detailed Solution:

To determine in which month the man's total savings will exceed 50,000 Taka, we need to set up an equation based on his monthly savings.

1. **Determine the expression for total savings:**
   - The man saves 850 Taka each month. Therefore, after \( n \) months, his total savings can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total Savings} = 850n
     \]

2. **Set up the inequality to find when savings exceed 50,000 Taka:**
   - We want to determine when his total savings will exceed 50,000. Thus, we set up the inequality:
     \[
     850n > 50,000
     \]

3. **Solve the inequality for \( n \):**
   - Divide both sides of the inequality by 850 to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n > \frac{50,000}{850}
     \]

4. **Calculate the division:**
   - Performing the division, we get:
     \[
     n > 58.8235
     \]

5. **Interpret the result:**
   - Since \( n \) must be a whole number (as it represents the number of months), we round up to the nearest whole number. This is because \( n \) must be greater than 58.8235, meaning it has to be \( n = 59 \) or greater.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, in the 59th month, his total savings will exceed 50,000 Taka.

   A ribbon 50/3 meters long is cut into 3/8 of its length, and then the remaining part is divided into 5 equal pieces. What will be the length of one piece?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   - **Step 1:** Calculate the original length of the ribbon in meters.

     \[
     \text{Original length of the ribbon} = \frac{50}{3} \text{ meters}
     \]

   - **Step 2:** Determine the portion of the ribbon that is cut off.

     We need to find \( \frac{3}{8} \) of the total length of the ribbon, which is:

     \[
     \text{Length of cut portion} = \left(\frac{3}{8}\right) \times \left(\frac{50}{3}\right) = \frac{3 \times 50}{8 \times 3} = \frac{50}{8} = \frac{25}{4} \text{ meters}
     \]

   - **Step 3:** Calculate the remaining length of the ribbon after cutting off the portion.

     \[
     \text{Remaining length} = \frac{50}{3} - \frac{25}{4}
     \]

     To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.

     \[
     \frac{50}{3} = \frac{50 \times 4}{12} = \frac{200}{12}
     \]

     \[
     \frac{25}{4} = \frac{25 \times 3}{12} = \frac{75}{12}
     \]

     Now subtract the fractions:

     \[
     \text{Remaining length} = \frac{200}{12} - \frac{75}{12} = \frac{125}{12} \text{ meters}
     \]

   - **Step 4:** Divide the remaining length of the ribbon into 5 equal pieces.

     \[
     \text{Length of one piece} = \frac{125}{12} \div 5 = \frac{125}{12} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{125}{60} = \frac{25}{12} \text{ meters}

The divisor is 78, the quotient is 25, and the remainder is one-third of the divisor. What is the dividend?

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for division:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \]

Given:
- Divisor = 78
- Quotient = 25
- Remainder = \(\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Divisor} = \frac{1}{3} \times 78\)

First, let's calculate the remainder:

\[ \text{Remainder} = \frac{1}{3} \times 78 = \frac{78}{3} = 26 \]

Now we can substitute these values into the division formula to find the dividend:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (78 \times 25) + 26 \]

Calculate the product:

\[ 78 \times 25 = 1950 \]

Now add the remainder:

\[ \text{Dividend} = 1950 + 26 = 1976 \]

Therefore, the dividend is 1976.

""In a hostel, there are 20 students with a stock of 150 kg of flour for 30 days. However, 30 kg of flour has been spoiled, and 5 students have left for home. For how many days will the remaining students be able to manage with the remaining flour?""

**Solution:**

Step 1: **Initial Setup**

Initially, 20 students were to consume 150 kg of flour for 30 days. This means that the total flour consumption required per student per day can be calculated as follows:

- Total consumption for 20 students for 30 days = 150 kg.
- Per day consumption for 20 students = 150 kg / 30 days = 5 kg/day.
- Per student per day consumption = 5 kg/day / 20 students = 0.25 kg/student/day.

Step 2: **Adjust for Spoiled Flour**

30 kg of flour has become spoiled, so the remaining usable flour is:

- Remaining flour = 150 kg - 30 kg = 120 kg.

Step 3: **Adjust for Leaving Students**

After 5 students leave, the number of remaining students is:

- Remaining students = 20 students - 5 students = 15 students.

Step 4: **Calculate Days of Consumption with Remaining Flour**

Now, the remaining 15 students will consume the 120 kg of flour. We need to find out how many days this stock will last.

Using the per student per day consumption calculated earlier:

- The daily consumption for 15 students = 15 students × 0.25 kg/student/day = 3.75 kg/day.

Finally, the number of days the remaining flour will last:

- Number of days = Total remaining flour / Daily consumption for 15 students
- Number of days = 120 kg / 3.75 kg/day = 32 days.

**Conclusion**

Thus, the remaining flour will last for **32 days** for the 15 students.

What is the smallest number that, when added to 5320, results in a perfect square? 

## Solution

We need to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that \( 5320 + x \) is a perfect square.

### Step 1: Estimate the Square Root of 5320

First, let's find the approximate square root of 5320. Since \( \sqrt{5320} \) is not an integer, we'll estimate it to find the nearest perfect square:

Calculating \( \sqrt{5320} \) gives approximately 72.97.

### Step 2: Identify the Nearest Perfect Squares

Let's consider the perfect squares around this estimate:
- \( 72^2 = 5184 \)
- \( 73^2 = 5329 \)

Since \( 5329 \) (which is \( 73^2 \)) is the next perfect square after 5184, we want \( 5320 + x = 5329 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( x \)

Now subtract 5320 from 5329 to find \( x \):

\[
x = 5329 - 5320 = 9
\]

Thus, the smallest number to be added to 5320 to make it a perfect square is 9.

A triangular field has a base of 24 meters and a height of 15 meters 50 centimeters. What is its area in square meters?

### Step-by-Step Solution

To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
\]

**Step 1: Convert the height to meters.**

The height given is 15 meters 50 centimeters. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, we can express the height in meters as follows:

\[
50 \text{ cm} = \frac{50}{100} \text{ m} = 0.5 \text{ m}
\]

Therefore, the height of the triangle in meters is:

\[
15 \text{ m} + 0.5 \text{ m} = 15.5 \text{ m}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the area.**

Now, using the formula for the area of a triangle, substitute the base and height:

\[
\text{Base} = 24 \text{ m}
\]
\[
\text{Height} = 15.5 \text{ m}
\]

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \times 15.5
\]

**Step 3: Compute the numerical value.**

First, calculate the product of the base and height:

\[
24 \times 15.5 = 372
\]

Then, find the area by halving this product:

The area of a garden is 20 square meters. \( \frac{5}{6} \) of this garden is cultivated with flowers. What is the area of the cultivated part of the garden in square meters?

## Detailed Solution:
To determine the area of the garden that is cultivated with flowers, we need to calculate \( \frac{5}{6} \) of the total area of the garden, which is 20 square meters.

### Step-by-Step Calculations:
1. **Identify the Fractions Involved**: 
   - Total area of the garden = 20 square meters.
   - Fraction of the garden cultivated with flowers = \( \frac{5}{6} \).

2. **Calculate the Cultivated Area**:
   - To find the cultivated area, multiply the total area by the fraction that represents the cultivated part:
   \[
   \text{Cultivated Area} = 20 \times \frac{5}{6}
   \]

3. **Perform the Multiplication**:
   - First, divide 20 by 6:
   \[
   \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.3333
   \]
   - Then, multiply \( \frac{10}{3} \) by 5:
   \[
   \frac{10}{3} \times 5 = \frac{10 \times 5}{3} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.6667
   \]

4. **Express as a Decimal or Mixed Fraction**:
   - Converting to a decimal gives us approximately 16.67, but since it's a straightforward division, \( \frac{50}{3} \) is equivalent to 16 and \( \frac{2}{3} \).

5. **Verify Calculation**:
   - Alternatively, check by multiplying through step-by-step:
   \[
   20 \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{20 \times 5}{6} = \frac{100}{6} = 16.6667
   \]

Therefore, the area of the garden that is cultivated with flowers is approximately 16.67 square meters, or precisely \( \frac{50}{3} \).

**Conclusion**:
The area of the garden cultivated with flowers is \( \frac{50}{3} \), or approximately 16.67 square meters.

A train travels from Kamalapur Station to Narayanganj Station at a speed of 30 km/hr. If the distance was 25 km, it would have taken 10 minutes longer. What is the distance between the two stations in kilometers?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve this problem, let's identify and understand the given information:

1. **Train Speed:** The train's speed is 30 km/hr.

2. **New Hypothetical Situation:**
   - Hypothetical Distance = 25 km.
   - Time required if the distance were 25 km = time with actual distance + 10 minutes.

Let's denote:
- \( d \) = actual distance between Kamalapur Station and Narayanganj Station in km.
- \( t \) = actual time taken to travel distance \( d \) in hours.

Using the formula for distance, we have:
\[ 
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} 
\]

Thus:
\[ 
d = 30 \times t 
\] 
So, \( t = \frac{d}{30} \).

For the hypothetical situation (distance = 25 km):
\[ 
25 = 30 \times (t + \frac{10}{60}) 
\]
\[ 
25 = 30 \times (t + \frac{1}{6}) 
\]

Simplifying:
\[ 
25 = 30t + 5 
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ 
20 = 30t 
\]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ 
t = \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours} 
\]

Now, using the actual travel time \( t = \frac{2}{3} \) in the initial distance formula:
\[ 
d = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} 
\]
\[ 
d = 20 \text{ km} 
\]

### Conclusion:

The actual distance between Kamalapur Station and Narayanganj Station is **20 kilometers**.

The cost of carpeting a room's floor is 7200 Taka in total. If the room's width were 3 meters less, the expense would be 576 Taka less. What is the width of the room in meters?

### Step-by-step solution with explanations:

Let the length and width of the room be \( l \) meters and \( w \) meters respectively. The cost of carpeting is directly proportional to the area of the floor, so the cost per square meter is a constant.

1. **Determine the cost per square meter:**

   The total cost to carpet the room is 7200 Taka, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost per square meter} = \frac{7200}{lw}
   \]

2. **Express the new scenario:**

   If the width of the room is 3 meters less, the width becomes \( w - 3 \). In this case, the new area becomes \( l(w - 3) \), and the cost would be 576 Taka less than the original:

   \[
   \text{New Cost} = 7200 - 576 = 6624
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Cost per square meter} = \frac{6624}{l(w - 3)}
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**

   Since the cost per square meter must be the same in both scenarios, we equate the two expressions:
   \[
   \frac{7200}{lw} = \frac{6624}{l(w - 3)}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**

   Cross-multiply to eliminate fractions:
   \[
   7200 \cdot l(w - 3) = 6624 \cdot lw
   \]

   Expanding the left side gives:
   \[
   7200lw - 21600l = 6624lw
   \]

   Rearranging terms yields:
   \[
   7200lw - 6624lw = 21600l
   \]

   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   576lw = 21600l
   \]

   Dividing both sides by \( 576l \) (assuming \( l \neq 0 \)):
   \[
   w = \frac{21600}{576} = 37.5
   \]

The Spurs basketball team has 22 players. Each player has 11 basketballs. Altogether, how many basketballs do they have?

### Solution:

To find out the total number of basketballs that the team has, we need to perform a simple multiplication operation. This is because each player contributes equally to the total number of basketballs.

1. **Identify the number of players and basketballs per player:**  
   - Number of players = 22
   - Basketballs per player = 11

2. **Calculate the total number of basketballs:**  
   To determine how many basketballs there are in total, multiply the number of players by the number of basketballs each possesses. This can be expressed mathematically as:

   \[
   \text{Total basketballs} = \text{Number of players} \times \text{Basketballs per player}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Total basketballs} = 22 \times 11
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**

   \[
   22 \times 11 = 242
   \]

   The multiplication can be reasoned as follows: multiplying 22 by 11 can be broken down into two simpler multiplications and added together:
   - \( 22 \times 10 = 220 \)
   - \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \)

   Adding these two results:
   
   \[
   220 + 22 = 242
   \]

Thus, the Spurs basketball team has a total of 242 basketballs.

### Conclusion:

The total number of basketballs that the Spurs basketball team has is **242**.

A two-digit number has digits that add up to 10 and the difference between the digits is 4. Determine the largest possible such number.

2. **Step-by-step Solution:**

Let's denote the tens digit of the two-digit number as \( x \) and the units digit as \( y \).

Given conditions:
- The sum of the digits: \( x + y = 10 \)
- The difference of the digits: \( x - y = 4 \)

We have a system of two equations:

1. \( x + y = 10 \)
2. \( x - y = 4 \)

To solve for \( x \) and \( y \), we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's add these two equations to eliminate \( y \):

\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 10 + 4 \]

Simplifying this gives:

\[ 2x = 14 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

\[ x = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 7 \) back into one of the original equations, say \( x + y = 10 \):

\[ 7 + y = 10 \]

Subtracting 7 from both sides gives:

\[ y = 3 \]

Thus, the digits of the number are 7 and 3. Since we want to form the largest possible two-digit number, the tens digit should be the larger digit, \( x = 7 \), and the units digit \( y = 3 \).

Therefore, the largest possible two-digit number is 73.

3. **Conclusion:**

The largest two-digit number where the sum of its digits is 10 and the difference of its digits is 4 is:

The principal amount becomes 1578 taka after 3 years and 1830 taka after 5 years. Determine the rate of interest per annum.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote:
- \( P \) = Principal amount
- \( R \) = Rate of interest per annum
- \( T \) = Time in years
- \( A \) = Amount after \( T \) years
- \( S \) = Simple interest

We are given the following:
- After 3 years, the amount \( A_3 = 1578 \) 
- After 5 years, the amount \( A_5 = 1830 \)

We will use the formula for simple interest:
\[ A = P + S \]
Where,
\[ S = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

### Step 1: Set up equations for each period

For 3 years:
\[ P + \frac{P \times R \times 3}{100} = 1578 \]

For 5 years:
\[ P + \frac{P \times R \times 5}{100} = 1830 \]

### Step 2: Determine the interest difference

The interest for the 3 to 5-year period is the difference in amounts:
\[ 1830 - 1578 = 252 \]

This represents the simple interest for 2 years, so:
\[ \frac{P \times R \times 2}{100} = 252 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \times R \)

\[
P \times R = \frac{252 \times 100}{2} = 12600
\]

### Step 4: Use one period's equation to solve for \( P \)

From the 3-year equation:
\[
P + \frac{P \times R \times 3}{100} = 1578
\]
Substitute \( P \times R = 12600 \):
\[
P + \frac{3 \times 12600}{100} = 1578
\]
\[
P + 378 = 1578
\]
\[
P = 1578 - 378 = 1200
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Rate \( R \)

Substitute \( P = 1200 \) into \( P \times R = 12600 \):

A movie theater charges 7.50 taka for adults and 4.50 taka for children. The proceeds from a movie showing amounted to 540 taka. If 80 tickets were sold, how many adult tickets were sold?

### Step-by-step Solution:

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of adult tickets sold.
- Let \( y \) be the number of children tickets sold.

We have the following system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of tickets sold is 80:
   \[
   x + y = 80
   \]

2. The total revenue from these tickets is 540 taka:
   \[
   7.50x + 4.50y = 540
   \]

**Step 1: Solve the system of equations.**

From equation (1):
\[
x + y = 80
\]
We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 80 - x
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( y = 80 - x \) into equation (2):**
\[
7.50x + 4.50(80 - x) = 540
\]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[
7.50x + 360 - 4.50x = 540
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
3.00x + 360 = 540
\]

Subtract 360 from both sides:
\[
3.00x = 180
\]

Divide both sides by 3.00:
\[
x = 60
\]

Thus, the number of adult tickets sold is 60.

Today, my grandmother made a substantial amount of plum pickle. She filled 4/7 of it into a glass jar and set it aside. The rest was equally divided among the 6 of us. Calculate what fraction of the total pickle each of us received.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Fraction for Distribution**: 
   - Grandmother filled 4/7 of the pickle into a jar. Therefore, she set aside \(4/7\) of the total pickle.
   - The remaining pickle for distribution is the complement of \(4/7\) with respect to the whole, which is \(1 - 4/7\).

2. **Calculate the Fraction of Pickle Remaining**:
   \[
   1 - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{7}{7} - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{3}{7}
   \]
   Thus, \(3/7\) of the total pickle is available for distribution among the 6 of us.

3. **Divide the Remaining Pickle Among 6 People**:
   - We need to divide \(\frac{3}{7}\) equally among 6 people. To find out how much each person gets, divide \(\frac{3}{7}\) by 6.

4. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   \frac{3}{7} \div 6 = \frac{3}{7} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3 \times 1}{7 \times 6} = \frac{3}{42}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Fraction**:
   - The fraction \(\frac{3}{42}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor, which is 3.
   \[
   \frac{3}{42} = \frac{3 \div 3}{42 \div 3} = \frac{1}{14}

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote:
- Sobuj's share as \( S \)
- Dalim's share as \( D \)
- Lincoln's share as \( L \)

### Relationship Analysis:
1. **Relation between Sobuj and Dalim:**  
   Sobuj's share = \( \frac{3}{5} \) of Dalim's share  
   Therefore, \( S = \frac{3}{5}D \)  

2. **Relation between Dalim and Lincoln:**  
   Dalim's share is twice Lincoln's share  
   Therefore, \( D = 2L \)  

3. **Total Share Equation:**
   According to the problem, the total amount of money, 6300 Taka, is divided among Sobuj, Dalim, and Lincoln.
   Therefore, we can write:  
   \[
   S + D + L = 6300
   \]

### Substitution into Total Equation:
Using the relations identified:
- Substitute \( S = \frac{3}{5}D \) into the total equation.
- Substitute \( D = 2L \) into the equation.

Substitute \( D = 2L \) into \( S = \frac{3}{5}D \):  
\[ S = \frac{3}{5} \times 2L = \frac{6}{5}L \]

Now, substitute \( S = \frac{6}{5}L \) and \( D = 2L \) into the total equation:
\[ \frac{6}{5}L + 2L + L = 6300 \]

### Simplifying the Expression:
Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{6}{5}L + 2L + 1L = 6300 \]

First, convert the whole number coefficients to fractions with a common denominator of 5:
\[ \frac{6}{5}L + \frac{10}{5}L + \frac{5}{5}L = 6300 \]
\[ \frac{6L + 10L + 5L}{5} = 6300 \]

A tank holds 8000 liters of water. If the length of the tank is 2.56 meters and the width is 1.25 meters, what is the depth in meters?

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular tank that can hold 8000 liters of water.
   - We need to find the depth of the tank.
   - Given dimensions:
     - Length = 2.56 meters
     - Width = 1.25 meters
   - Volume of the tank = 8000 liters.

2. **Unit Conversion:**
   - 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters.
   - Therefore, the volume of the tank in cubic meters is:
     \[
     \text{Volume in cubic meters} = \frac{8000 \text{ liters}}{1000 \text{ liters/cubic meter}} = 8 \text{ cubic meters}.
     \]

3. **Formula for the Volume of a Rectangular Prism:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (such as a tank) is given by:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}.
     \]
   - We need to calculate the depth \( d \).

4. **Plug in the Known Values:**
   \[
   8 = 2.56 \times 1.25 \times d.
   \]

5. **Solve for Depth \( d \):**
   - First, calculate the product of the length and width:
     \[
     2.56 \times 1.25 = 3.2.
     \]
   - Now, use the equation for volume:
     \[
     8 = 3.2 \times d.
     \]
   - Solve for \( d \) by dividing both sides by 3.2:
     \[
     d = \frac{8}{3.2}.
     \]

6. **Compute the Final Depth:**
   \[
   d = \frac{8}{3.2} = 2.5.
   \]

Therefore, the depth of the tank is 2.5 meters.

From 4639, which smallest number should be subtracted so that the result is a perfect square? What will that number be?

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number \( x \) such that when it is subtracted from 4639, the result is a perfect square.

1. **Estimate the Square Root:**
   - First, find the approximate square root of 4639 to determine the closest perfect square. The square root of 4639 is approximately \( \sqrt{4639} \approx 68.13 \).
   - From this estimation, we suspect that \( 4624 \) (which is \( 68^2 \)) and \( 4761 \) (which is \( 69^2 \)) are nearby perfect squares.

2. **Calculate Differences:**
   - Calculate \( 4639 - 68^2 = 4639 - 4624 = 15 \).
   - We correctly found that subtracting 15 gives us the perfect square 4624 (since \( 68^2 = 4624 \)).

3. **Verify the Immediate Higher Perfect Square:**
   - Check the next perfect square \( 69^2 = 4761 \).
   - Since \( 4761 > 4639 \), it does not help us in finding a smaller number to subtract.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The smallest number we need to subtract from 4639 to get a perfect square is \( 15 \).

Therefore, after following these logical steps, we determine the smallest number that you must subtract from 4639 to make it a perfect square.

Rabi buys 50 kilograms of rice at 40 taka per kilogram and sells it at 44 taka per kilogram. Calculate the profit or loss in taka.

## Solution:

To determine the profit or loss, we first need to calculate both the cost price and the selling price of the rice.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost Price
- The cost price per kilogram = 40 taka
- Total quantity of rice = 50 kilograms
- Total cost price = Cost price per kilogram × Total quantity 
  \[
  = 40 \, \text{taka/kg} \times 50 \, \text{kg} = 2000 \, \text{taka}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Selling Price
- The selling price per kilogram = 44 taka
- Total quantity of rice = 50 kilograms
- Total selling price = Selling price per kilogram × Total quantity
  \[
  = 44 \, \text{taka/kg} \times 50 \, \text{kg} = 2200 \, \text{taka}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit or Loss
- Profit/Loss = Total Selling Price - Total Cost Price
  \[
  = 2200 \, \text{taka} - 2000 \, \text{taka} = 200 \, \text{taka}
  \]

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, Rabi makes a profit.

Habiba and Halima can complete a piece of work together in 20 days. After working together for 8 days, Habiba left. Halima completed the remaining work in 21 days. How many days would it take Halima to complete the entire work by herself?

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the work completed by Habiba and Halima in 8 days:**

   - Since Habiba and Halima together can complete the entire work in 20 days, their combined work rate is \(\frac{1}{20}\) of the work per day.
   - Therefore, in 8 days, they complete \[ 8 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{8}{20} = \frac{2}{5} \] of the work.

2. **Calculate the remaining work:**

   - Total work to be done is 1 unit of work.
   - Work done in 8 days = \(\frac{2}{5}\).
   - Therefore, remaining work = \(1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{5}{5} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}\).

3. **Work rate of Halima alone:**

   - Halima completes the remaining \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the work in 21 days.
   - Therefore, Halima's work rate is \(\frac{\frac{3}{5}}{21} = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{21} = \frac{3}{105} = \frac{1}{35}\) of the work per day.

4. **Time for Halima to complete the entire work alone:**

   - Since Halima can do \(\frac{1}{35}\) of the work in one day, the time taken by her to complete the entire work is the reciprocal of her work rate.
   - Thus, the time for Halima to complete the entire work alone is 35 days.

A tank with a length of 3 meters, a width of 2 meters, and a height of 1 meter contains a solid metallic cube with a side length of 50 cm. Once the tank is filled with water and the cube is removed, what will be the depth of the water in meters?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Find the Volume of the Tank:**
   - The dimensions of the tank are given as: length = 3 meters, width = 2 meters, and height = 1 meter.
   - The volume of the tank (V_tank) is calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
     \[
     V_{\text{tank}} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \, \text{cubic meters}
     \]

2. **Find the Volume of the Cube:**
   - The side of the cube is given as 50 cm. First, convert the side length from centimeters to meters:
     \[
     \text{Side length in meters} = 50 \, \text{cm} = 0.5 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - The volume of the cube (V_cube) is calculated using the formula for the volume of a cube:
     \[
     V_{\text{cube}} = (\text{side length})^3 = (0.5)^3 = 0.125 \, \text{cubic meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Volume of Water Displaced by the Cube:**

There are more than 10 students at a place. A teacher wants to distribute 42 bananas, 84 biscuits, and 105 chocolates among the students equally, without any remainder. The teacher can distribute the bananas, biscuits, and chocolates equally among how many students?

### Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers of bananas (42), biscuits (84), and chocolates (105). The GCD will tell us the largest number of students among which all the items can be distributed equally.

#### Step 1: Find the prime factors of each number.

- **42**: The prime factorization of 42 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \).
- **84**: The prime factorization of 84 is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \).
- **105**: The prime factorization of 105 is \( 3 \times 5 \times 7 \).

#### Step 2: Identify the common prime factors.

The common prime factors among 42, 84, and 105 are \( 3 \) and \( 7 \).

#### Step 3: Calculate the GCD.

To find the GCD, we take the lowest power of all common prime factors:
- The lowest power of \( 3 \) among the three numbers is \( 3^1 \).
- The lowest power of \( 7 \) among the three numbers is \( 7^1 \).

Thus, the GCD is: 
\[ 3^1 \times 7^1 = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

#### Step 4: Verify conditions about the number of students.
The problem states that there are more than 10 students and that teachers can distribute the items without remainder among these students. The calculated GCD, 21, satisfies these conditions as \( 21 > 10 \).

Therefore, the teacher can distribute 42 bananas, 84 biscuits, and 105 chocolates equally among 21 students without any remainder.

   In a certain school, there are a total of 50 students in the 5th grade, of which 42% are female students. How many male students are in that grade?

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution:**

   To find the number of male students in the 5th grade, we can follow these steps:

   - First, calculate the number of female students (girls) in the class.
   
   - Since 42% of the total 50 students are girls, we calculate the number of girls using the percentage formula:
   
     \[
     \text{Number of girls} = 42\% \text{ of } 50
     \]
   
   - Convert the percentage to a decimal to perform the multiplication:
   
     \[
     42\% = \frac{42}{100} = 0.42
     \]
   
   - Multiply this decimal by the total number of students to get the number of girls:
   
     \[
     \text{Number of girls} = 0.42 \times 50 = 21
     \]

   - Now, to find the number of male students (boys), subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:
   
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of girls} = 50 - 21 = 29

Translation in English:
For a two-digit number, if you add 7 to the sum of its digits, the result is three times the ten's digit. However, if you subtract 18 from the number, the digits reverse their positions. What is the number?

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Problem

Let the two-digit number be \( 10a + b \), where:
- \( a \) is the ten's digit,
- \( b \) is the unit's digit.

**Condition 1:**
The sum of the digits plus 7 equals three times the ten's digit:
\[ a + b + 7 = 3a \]

**Condition 2:**
If you subtract 18 from the number, the digits reverse:
\[ 10a + b - 18 = 10b + a \]

### Step 3: Solve the Equations

**From Condition 1:**
\[ a + b + 7 = 3a \]
\[ b + 7 = 2a \]
\[ b = 2a - 7 \] (Equation 1)

**From Condition 2:**
\[ 10a + b - 18 = 10b + a \]
\[ 9a - 9b = 18 \]
\[ a - b = 2 \] (Equation 2)

### Step 4: Substitute and Solve the Equations

Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:
From Equation 2:
\[ a = b + 2 \]

Substitute \( a = b + 2 \) in Equation 1:
\[ b = 2(b + 2) - 7 \]
\[ b = 2b + 4 - 7 \]
\[ b = 2b - 3 \]
\[ 3 = b \]

Substitute \( b = 3 \) into \( a = b + 2 \):
\[ a = 3 + 2 \]
\[ a = 5 \]

Thus, the number is \( 10a + b = 10 \times 5 +"

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]
\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 162 is:
\[ 162 = 2^1 \times 3^4 \]

### Step 2: Making the Product a Perfect Square
For \( 162 \times n \) to be a perfect square, all the prime factors in its factorization must have even exponents.

From the factorization \( 162 = 2^1 \times 3^4 \):
- The exponent of 2 is 1 (which is odd), so we need one more factor of 2 to make it even.
- The exponent of 3 is 4 (already even), so we do not need additional factors of 3.

### Step 3: Determine the Smallest \( n \)
To have all exponents even:
- Multiply by \( 2^1 \) to make the exponent of 2 even.

Thus, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition is \( n = 2 \).

### Verification
Let's verify the product when \( n = 2 \):
\[ 162 \times 2 = 324 \]

Now, check if 324 is a perfect square:
\[ \sqrt{324} = 18 \]

Since 18 is a whole number, 324 is indeed a perfect square.

## Conclusion:
The smallest natural number such that 162 multiplied by it yields a perfect square is **2**.

A gardener wants to fence a circular garden with a rope twice around its perimeter. The garden has a radius of 21 meters. If each meter of rope costs 18 taka, how much taka does he need to buy the rope?

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate the circumference of the circular garden:**

   The formula to calculate the circumference \( C \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is:

   \[
   C = 2\pi r
   \]

   Here, the radius \( r \) is given as 21 meters. So, we substitute the radius into the formula:

   \[
   C = 2 \pi \times 21 = 42\pi
   \]

   Approximating \(\pi\) as 3.1416, we calculate:

   \[
   C \approx 42 \times 3.1416 = 131.9462 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the total length of rope needed:**

   Since the gardener wants to place the rope twice around the garden, we multiply the circumference by 2:

   \[
   \text{Total rope length} = 2 \times 131.9462 \approx 263.8924 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the rope:**

   The cost of rope per meter is 18 taka. Therefore, the total cost is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 263.8924 \times 18 = 4749.0632 \text{ taka}
   \]

   As currency is dealt in whole numbers, we round the total cost to the nearest whole number:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} \approx 4749 \text{ taka}
   \]

### Conclusion

The gardener needs to purchase rope costing **4749 taka**.

Shafiqul Uncle from Aantla village has brought 780 papaya plant seedlings to plant in his field. He has decided to plant a certain number of seedlings in such a way that the number of seedlings in each row is equal to the number of rows. However, while planting the seedlings in this manner, he realizes he is 4 seedlings short. Shafiqul Uncle has decided to plant the seedlings in _____ rows.

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we first frame it mathematically.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**  
   We know Shafiqul Uncle wants to plant the seedlings in such a way that the number of rows is equal to the number of seedlings in each row. If this number is denoted as \( n \), then he needs \( n \times n \) seedlings, as the arrangement forms a perfect square.

2. **Account for the Shortage:**  
   Shafiqul Uncle realizes he is 4 seedlings short of a perfect square. Therefore, the actual number of seedlings he has is \( n \times n - 4 = 780 \).

3. **Equation Formation:**  
   The equation becomes:
   \[
   n^2 - 4 = 780
   \]

4. **Solve for \( n \):**  
   Rearranging the equation:
   \[
   n^2 = 780 + 4
   \]
   \[
   n^2 = 784
   \]

5. **Calculate \( n \):**  
   To find \( n \), take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   n = \sqrt{784}
   \]
   \[
   n = 28
   \]

Therefore, Shafiqul Uncle should plant the seedlings in **28 rows** to meet his requirement, considering the 4 seedlings short.

To paint \( \frac{3}{5} \) square meters of wall, \( \frac{1}{3} \) deciliters of paint is required. How many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint?

### Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many square meters can be covered with 1 deciliter of paint, given that \( \frac{1}{3} \) deciliter of paint covers \( \frac{3}{5} \) square meters.

1. **Understanding the Rate of Coverage:**

   The rate of paint coverage is:
   \[
   \text{Coverage per deciliter} = \frac{\text{Area covered}}{\text{Amount of paint used}} = \frac{\frac{3}{5} \text{ square meters}}{\frac{1}{3} \text{ deciliters}}
   \]

2. **Calculating the Coverage Rate:**

   To find the rate at which paint covers the wall, we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{3}{1} = \frac{9}{5}
   \]

   This calculation shows that \( \frac{9}{5} \) square meters can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Therefore, with 1 deciliter of paint, it is possible to paint \(\frac{9}{5}\) square meters of wall.

Farida and Fatema's combined salary is 19,950 Taka. Farida earns 2,450 Taka more than Fatema. What is Farida's salary in Taka?

## Step-by-Step Solution:
Let's denote the salary of Fatema as \( F \).

1. **Express Farida's Salary in terms of Fatema's Salary:**
   Since Farida earns 2,450 Taka more than Fatema, we can write Farida's salary as:
   \[
   F + 2450
   \]

2. **Set up the Equation for Combined Salary:**
   The total salary of Farida and Fatema together is given as 19,950 Taka. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   F + (F + 2450) = 19950
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Combine the terms involving \( F \):
   \[
   2F + 2450 = 19950
   \]

4. **Solve for \( F \):**
   First, subtract 2,450 from both sides to isolate terms involving \( F \):
   \[
   2F = 19950 - 2450
   \]
   \[
   2F = 17500
   \]

   Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of \( F \):
   \[
   F = \frac{17500}{2} = 8750
   \]

5. **Calculate Farida's Salary:**
   Now that we have Fatema's salary (\( F = 8750 \)), we calculate Farida's salary:
   \[
   F + 2450 = 8750 + 2450 = 11200
   \]

Hence, Farida's salary is **11,200 Taka**.

The product of two positive numbers is 147; the larger number is 3 times the smaller number. What is the larger number?

## Step-by-Step Solution

Let's denote the smaller number as \( x \). According to the problem, the larger number is 3 times the smaller number. Therefore, we can express the larger number as \( 3x \).

The problem states that the product of the two numbers is 147. This gives us the equation:
\[
x \times 3x = 147
\]

Simplifying this equation, we have:
\[
3x^2 = 147
\]

To solve for \( x^2 \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
x^2 = \frac{147}{3}
\]

Calculating the division:
\[
x^2 = 49
\]

To find \( x \), take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{49}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
x = 7
\]

Now that we have found the smaller number \( x \), we can find the larger number by using the relationship between the two numbers:
\[
3x = 3 \times 7 = 21

Tanvir's farm has 50 bulls and 60 cows. If each cow gives birth to 2 calves per year and 30% of the calves die due to illness, how many animals will there be on Tanvir's farm after one year?

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initial Animals:**
   - Number of bulls = 50
   - Number of cows = 60

2. **Calves Born:**
   - Each cow gives birth to 2 calves.
   - Total calves born = 60 cows × 2 calves per cow = 120 calves

3. **Calves Mortality Due to Illness:**
   - 30% of the calves die due to illness.
   - Number of calves that die = 30% of 120 = 0.30 × 120 = 36 calves

4. **Calves Surviving:**
   - Total calves surviving = Total calves born - Calves that die
   - Total calves surviving = 120 - 36 = 84 calves

5. **Total Animals on the Farm After One Year:**
   - Total animals = Initial bulls + Initial cows + Surviving calves
   - Total animals = 50 bulls + 60 cows + 84 surviving calves
   - Total animals = 50 + 60 + 84 = 194

A small box has a length of 15 cm 2.4 mm, a width of 7 cm 6.2 mm, and a height of 5 cm 8 mm. Calculate the volume of the box in cubic centimeters.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert all dimensions to centimeters:**

   - **Length:** 
     - The length is given as 15 cm 2.4 mm.
     - Convert millimeters to centimeters: 2.4 mm = 2.4 / 10 = 0.24 cm.
     - Total length in centimeters = 15 cm + 0.24 cm = 15.24 cm.
   
   - **Width:**
     - The width is given as 7 cm 6.2 mm.
     - Convert millimeters to centimeters: 6.2 mm = 6.2 / 10 = 0.62 cm.
     - Total width in centimeters = 7 cm + 0.62 cm = 7.62 cm.
   
   - **Height:**
     - The height is given as 5 cm 8 mm.
     - Convert millimeters to centimeters: 8 mm = 8 / 10 = 0.8 cm.

Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln are three brothers. Their father divided 6300 Taka among them. In this, Sabuj receives 3/5 of what Dalim receives, and Dalim receives twice the amount Lincoln receives. How much money does Lincoln receive?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let Lincoln's amount be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, Dalim receives twice as much as Lincoln. So, Dalim receives \( 2x \).
   - Sabuj receives 3/5 of what Dalim receives, which translates to: Sabuj receives \( \frac{3}{5} \times 2x = \frac{6}{5}x \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total amount of money distributed among the three brothers is 6300 Taka. Hence, the equation for the total money is:
     \[
     x + 2x + \frac{6}{5}x = 6300
     \]

3. **Combine like terms in the equation:**
   - First, simplify the equation:
     \[
     x + 2x + \frac{6}{5}x = \frac{5x}{5} + \frac{10x}{5} + \frac{6x}{5} = \frac{21x}{5}
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Equate the terms and solve:
     \[
     \frac{21x}{5} = 6300
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     21x = 6300 \times 5
     \]
   - Calculate the right side: 
     \[
     21x = 31500
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 21 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{31500}{21}
     \]
   - Simplify the division:
     \[
     x = 1500
     \]

5. **Conclude the final answer:**
   - Since \( x \) represents the money Lincoln receives, Lincoln's amount = 1500 Taka.

Find the smallest natural number by which 7 should be multiplied to obtain a perfect square.

## Step-by-step Solution:

To find the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 7, results in a perfect square, we need to understand the properties of perfect squares and the concept of prime factorization.

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - Begin by considering the prime factorization of 7. The number 7 is a prime number, and its prime factorization is \( 7^1 \).

2. **Understanding Perfect Squares**:
   - A perfect square is a number whose prime factors all have even exponents. For example, \( x^2 \) is a perfect square if all prime factors of x have even powers in its factorization.

3. **Determine the Required Multiplier**:
   - We want \( 7 \times n = k^2 \), where \( k^2 \) is a perfect square.
   - From \( 7^1 \), the exponent of the prime number 7 is odd. To make it even, we can multiply by another 7 to get \( 7^2 \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - To achieve an even exponent for the factor 7, we need to multiply 7 by itself \((7^1 \times 7^1)\). Therefore, \( n = 7 \).
   - Multiplying 7 by 7 gives \( 49 \), and \( 49 \) is a perfect square since \( 49 = 7^2 \).

Thus, the smallest natural number that needs to be multiplied with 7 to get a perfect square is \( 7 \).

In a garden, while planting 1800 seedlings in a square, there are 36 extra seedlings. How many seedlings are there in each row?

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the configuration of the seedlings that forms a nearly perfect square. The problem states that 1800 seedlings, when attempted to be arranged into a square formation, leave 36 as extra. This implies that the largest square that can be formed uses `1800 - 36 = 1764` seedlings.

1. **Determine the side length of the largest square**

    The number of seedlings `N` that can be perfectly arranged in a square formation is given by the expression:
    \[
    N = s^2
    \]
    where `s` is the side length of the square.

    Here, `N = 1764`. Thus we have:
    \[
    s^2 = 1764
    \]

2. **Calculate the square root of 1764**

    To find `s`, take the square root of 1764:
    \[
    s = \sqrt{1764}
    \]

    Performing the square root calculation, we get:
    \[
    s = 42
    \]

Thus, the side length `s` is 42, which means there are 42 seedlings in each row of the square.

Therefore, each row in the square formation contains **42 seedlings**.

### Conclusion:
Each row of the square formation can hold 42 seedlings.

   What is the number which is 500 more than 1543?

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

   To find the number which is 500 greater than 1543, we perform an addition operation. We need to add 500 to 1543.

   - Start with the original number: 1543
   - Add the additional amount: 500

   Let's perform the addition:

   \[
   1543 + 500 = 2043
   \]

   First, we add the hundreds:
   
   - The hundreds digit of 1543 is 5 (in the hundreds place, which is 500).
   - We add the 500 to this digit, resulting in 1000.
   
   Next, we add this result to the original number:
   
   - Digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit:
     - The ones digit: \(3 + 0 = 3\),
     - The tens digit: \(4 + 0 = 4\),
     - The hundreds digit: \(5 + 5 = 10\) (but this causes a carry over),
     - Due to the carry over, we add 1 (from the carry) to the thousands digit: \(1 + 1 = 2\).

   Therefore, when all steps are combined, the resulting number is 2043.

To fortify a section of the Ichamati River bank, it takes 40 workers 35 days. How many workers are needed to complete the same work in 28 days?

## Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of work, which relates the number of workers, the amount of time required, and the total work output. The general principle is that work done is the product of the number of workers and the number of days they work.

1. **Determine the Total Work:**
   - Let the total amount of work be denoted by \( W \).
   - Using the given data, 40 workers complete this work in 35 days. Therefore, the total work \( W \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     W = \text{Number of workers} \times \text{Number of days} = 40 \times 35
     \]
   - Thus, \( W = 1400 \) ""worker-days.""

2. **Find the Number of Workers Needed for 28 Days:**
   - We are now tasked with finding the number of workers, say \( x \), required to complete the same \( W = 1400 \) worker-days of work in 28 days.
   - The equation will be:
     \[
     x \times 28 = 1400
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 28:
     \[
     x = \frac{1400}{28} = 50
     \]

Therefore, to complete the work in 28 days, 50 workers are required.

""Let's try to divide 210 taka between Fatema and Shakil in the ratio 3:4. How much money will Fatema receive?""

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Ratio:**
   - Fatema and Shakil are to receive the money in the ratio 3:4.
   - This means for every 3 parts that Fatema receives, Shakil receives 4 parts.
   - The total number of parts is \(3 + 4 = 7\).

2. **Determine the Value of One Part:**
   - The total amount of money to be divided is 210 taka.
   - If the total ratio is divided into 7 equal parts, we need to find the value of one part first.
   - Therefore, the value of one part is given by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts:
     \[
     \text{Value of one part} = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \text{ taka}
     \]

3. **Calculate Fatema's Share:**
   - Fatema is to receive 3 parts according to the ratio.
   - Therefore, the amount of money Fatema receives is calculated by multiplying the value of one part by 3:
     \[
     \text{Fatema's share} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ taka}
     \]

4. **Verify the Total:**
   - For verification, calculate Shakil's share and ensure the total adds up to 210 taka.
   - Shakil’s share is 4 parts, hence:
     \[
     \text{Shakil's share} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ taka}
     \]
   - Adding Fatema's and Shakil's shares gives:
     \[
     90 + 120 = 210 \text{ taka (which is correct)}
     \]

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

## Conclusion:
Fatema will receive **90 taka**.

Gold is 19.3 times heavier than water. The dimensions of a rectangular gold bar are as follows: length is 7.8 cm, width is 6.4 cm, and height is 2.5 cm. What is the weight of the gold bar in grams?

### Solution:

To find the weight of the gold bar, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the gold bar:**

   Since the gold bar is rectangular, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
   \]

   Plugging in the given dimensions:

   \[
   \text{Volume} = 7.8 \, \text{cm} \times 6.4 \, \text{cm} \times 2.5 \, \text{cm} = 124.8 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Determine the density of gold:**

   We know from the problem that gold is 19.3 times heavier than water. The density of water is \(1 \, \text{g/cm}^3\). Thus, the density of gold:

   \[
   \text{Density of gold} = 19.3 \times 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 19.3 \, \text{g/cm}^3
   \]

3. **Calculate the weight of the gold bar:**

   Weight is the product of volume and density. Hence, the weight of the gold bar can be calculated by:

   \[
   \text{Weight} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density of gold} = 124.8 \, \text{cm}^3 \times 19.3 \, \text{g/cm}^3
   \]

   \[
   \text{Weight} = 2407.44 \, \text{g}

Find the total surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 5.5 cm and a height of 8 cm. Use π = 3.14.

### Step-by-step Solution:

To find the total surface area of the cylinder, we need to calculate the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular bases.

#### Step 1: Calculate the lateral surface area of the cylinder

The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
\[ \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh \]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder,
- \( \pi \) is approximately 3.14.

Given:
- \( r = 5.5 \) cm
- \( h = 8 \) cm

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2 \times 3.14 \times 5.5 \times 8 \]

Calculate:
\[ = 2 \times 3.14 \times 5.5 \times 8 \]
\[ = 2 \times 3.14 \times 44 \]
\[ = 2 \times 138.16 \]
\[ = 276.32 \, \text{square cm} \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the area of the two circular bases

The formula for the area of one circular base is:
\[ \text{Area of one base} = \pi r^2 \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Area of one base} = 3.14 \times 5.5^2 \]

Calculate:
\[ = 3.14 \times 30.25 \]
\[ = 94.985 \, \text{square cm} \]

Since there are two bases, multiply by 2:
\[ \text{Area of two bases} = 2 \times 94.985 \]
\[ = 189.97 \, \text{square cm} \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the total surface area of the cylinder

The total surface area is the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the two bases.
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + \text{Area of two bases} \]

Calculate:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 276.32"

The length of a rectangular field is 25 meters more than its width. If the perimeter of the rectangular field is 150 meters, what is the length of the field in meters?

## Step-by-step Solution

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the rectangular field. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the width of the rectangle be \( w \) meters.
   - Therefore, the length of the rectangle will be \( (w + 25) \) meters (since it is 25 meters more than the width).

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Given that the perimeter is 150 meters, substitute the known values:
     \[
     150 = 2 \times ((w + 25) + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for Width \( w \):**
   - First, expand the expression within the parentheses:
     \[
     150 = 2 \times (w + 25 + w)
     \]
     \[
     150 = 2 \times (2w + 25)
     \]

   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to simplify:
     \[
     75 = 2w + 25
     \]

   - Subtract 25 from both sides to isolate terms with \( w \):
     \[
     75 - 25 = 2w
     \]
     \[
     50 = 2w
     \]

   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 25
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - We know the length is \( 25 \) meters more than the width:
     \[
     \text{length} = w + 25 = 25 + 25 = 50 \text{ meters}
     \]

Thus, the length of the rectangular field is **50 meters**.

A businessman sells 18 kg 300 g of rice and 5 kg 750 g of salt in one day. Calculate how much salt he sells in a month.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the quantities sold in kilograms and grams for one day.
   - We need to determine the quantity of salt sold over an entire month.

2. **Convert the Daily Salt Sale to Kilograms:**
   - The businessman sells 5 kg 750 g of salt in one day.
   - There are 1000 grams in a kilogram, so we convert the grams to kilograms:
     \[
     750 \text{ g} = \frac{750}{1000} \text{ kg} = 0.75 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Kilograms of Salt Sold Per Day:**
   - Add the converted grams to the kilograms for the total daily sale:
     \[
     5 \text{ kg} + 0.75 \text{ kg} = 5.75 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Monthly Salt Sale:**
   - To find the total amount of salt sold in a month, assume an average month consists of 30 days (since the problem does not specify the exact number of days in the month, this is a reasonable approximation).
   - Multiply the daily salt sale by the number of days in the month:
     \[
     5.75 \text{ kg/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 172.5 \text{ kg/month}

Let's try to divide 210 Taka between Fatema and Shakil in the ratio of 3:4. How much money will be given to Shakil?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this problem, we must divide the total amount of money (210 Taka) between Fatema and Shakil in the specified ratio of 3:4.

### Step 1: Understanding the Ratio
The ratio 3:4 means that for every 3 parts Fatema receives, Shakil receives 4 parts. 

### Step 2: Calculating Total Parts
To find out how many total parts the amount is divided into, we add the parts of the ratio together:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, the total number of parts is 7.

### Step 3: Finding the Value of One Part
To determine the value of one part, we divide the total amount of money (210 Taka) by the total number of parts (7):

\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \text{ Taka} \]

### Step 4: Calculating Shakil's Share
Since Shakil is supposed to receive 4 parts, we calculate the total amount given to Shakil by multiplying the value of one part by 4:

\[ \text{Shakil's share} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ Taka} \]

Therefore, Shakil should receive 120 Taka.

## Conclusion
Shakil will receive 120 Taka when 210 Taka is divided between Fatema and Shakil in the ratio of 3:4.

A flat owners' welfare association deposited a surplus amount of 200,000 Taka in a bank as a fixed deposit at compound interest for six months. If the annual interest rate is 12%, how much interest will be credited to the association's account after six months?

### Step-by-step Solution

1. **Identifying the Given Data:**
   - Principal Amount (P) = 200,000 Taka
   - Annual Interest Rate (r) = 12%
   - Time duration for interest calculation = 6 months

2. **Understanding Compound Interest:**
   - The formula for compound interest is:
     \[
     A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
     \]
     where:
     - \(A\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
     - \(P\) is the principal amount (initial money).
     - \(r\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
     - \(n\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
     - \(t\) is the time the money is invested for in years.

3. **Applying the Formula:**
   - Since the interest is compounded semi-annually (i.e., every 6 months), \(n = 2\) (twice a year).
   - The time of investment is 6 months, or half a year, so \(t = 0.5\) (in years).
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:

     \[
     A = 200,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \cdot 0.5}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Amount:**
   - First, calculate the rate per period: \(\frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06\).
   - Then calculate the compounded amount:

     \[
     A = 200,000 \times (1 + 0.06)^{1}
     \]
   
   - Simplify:

     \[
     A = 200,000 \times 1.06
     \]
     \[
     A = 212,000
     \]

5. **Calculating the Interest Earned:**
   - Interest earned is the total amount minus the principal:

Two positive perfect square numbers have a product of 1576, and their quotient is \( \frac{9}{7} \). What is the smaller number?

## Detailed Solution
We need to find two positive perfect square numbers, \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \), such that:

1. The product of these numbers: 
   \[
   a^2 \cdot b^2 = 1576
   \]

2. The quotient of these numbers:
   \[
   \frac{a^2}{b^2} = \frac{9}{7}
   \]

The second equation can be rewritten using properties of fractions as:
\[
a^2 = \frac{9}{7} \cdot b^2
\]

### Solving for \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \)
Firstly, let's express \( a \) in terms of \( b \) from the quotient equation:
\[
a = b \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

Since both \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, and considering \( a \) should also be a perfect square, let us solve it differently:
Given
\[
a^2 = 9k^2 \quad \text{and} \quad b^2 = 7k^2 \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]

Substituting these back into the product condition:
\[
(9k^2) \cdot (7k^2) = 1576
\]
\[
63k^4 = 1576
\]
\[
k^4 = \frac{1576}{63}
\]
\[
k^4 = 25
\]

Now, taking the fourth root:
\[
k^2 = \sqrt[4]{25} = 5
\]

Therefore, substituting back to find \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \):
\[
a^2 = 9 \times 5 = 45
\]

\[
b^2 = 7 \times 5 = 35
\]

Upon recalculation, since the fourth-root step seems incorrect (as they must be perfect squares and integer results):

Instead, check factorization directly via trials for correct factors:

A rectangular field has a length of 48 meters and a width of 32 meters and 80 centimeters. There is a road that is 3 meters wide surrounding the entire field. What is the area of the road in square meters?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert Measurements:**
   - The width of the rectangular field is given as 32 meters and 80 centimeters. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, convert 80 centimeters to meters:
     \[
     80 \text{ cm} = 0.8 \text{ m}
     \]

2. **Calculate Dimensions of the Field:**
   - The dimensions of the field in meters are:
     - Length = 48 meters
     - Width = 32 meters + 0.8 meters = \(32.8\) meters

3. **Calculate Area of the Field:**
   - Area of the field (\(A_{\text{field}}\)) is calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle, \(A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\):
     \[
     A_{\text{field}} = 48 \times 32.8 = 1574.4 \text{ square meters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Outer Dimensions Including the Road:**
   - Since the road is 3 meters wide surrounding the entire field, it adds 3 meters to each side of the rectangle:
     - New Length = 48 + (3 + 3) = 54 meters
     - New Width = 32.8 + (3 + 3) = 38.8 meters

5. **Calculate the Total Area Including the Road:**
   - Total area (\(A_{\text{total}}\)) of the larger rectangle, which includes the road:
     \[
     A_{\text{total}} = 54 \times 38.8 = 2095.2 \text{ square meters}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Area of the Road:**
   - The area of the road is the difference between the total area including the road and the area of the field:
     \[
     A_{\text{road}} = A_{\text{total}} - A_{\text{field}} = 2095.2 - 1574.4 = 520.8 \text{ square meters}

   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3x^2 = 147
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( x^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{147}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 49
     \]
   - To find \( x \), take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     x = \sqrt{49}
     \]
     \[
     x = 7

In a park, there is a banyan tree and a pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of these two trees was 2961 years. Currently, the age of the pine tree is 1432 years. What will be the sum of their ages 200 years from now?

## Solution:

1. **Understand Current Ages:**
   - We know the current age of the pine tree is \(1432\) years.

2. **Determine Past Age Data:**
   - 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the banyan and pine trees was \(2961\) years.
   - Let's denote the current age of the banyan tree as \(B\).

3. **Equation for 150 Years Ago:**
   - Pine tree's age 150 years ago = \(1432 - 150 = 1282\) years.
   - Let banyan tree's age 150 years ago = \(B - 150\) years.
   - According to the given data: 
     \[
     (B - 150) + 1282 = 2961
     \]

4. **Solve for \(B\):**
   \[
   B - 150 + 1282 = 2961
   \]
   \[
   B + 1132 = 2961
   \]
   \[
   B = 2961 - 1132
   \]
   \[
   B = 1829
   \]
   - So, the current age of the banyan tree is \(1829\) years.

5. **Determine Future Sum of Ages:**
   - In 200 years, each tree will be 200 years older.
   - Future age of the banyan tree: \(1829 + 200 = 2029\) years.
   - Future age of the pine tree: \(1432 + 200 = 1632\) years.
   - Total future sum of their ages = \(2029 + 1632\).

6. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   2029 + 1632 = 3661
   \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages 200 years from now will be **3661 years**.

11 kg of sugar is divided equally into 12 packets. What is the weight of each packet in kg?

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the weight of each packet, we need to divide the total amount of sugar by the number of packets. This involves a division operation. Let us proceed with the calculations:

### Step 1: Set up the Division
- **Total weight of sugar = 11 kg**
- **Number of packets = 12**

We need to divide the total weight of sugar by the number of packets to determine the weight of sugar in each packet.

### Step 2: Perform the Division
The division can be represented mathematically as:

\[ \text{Weight of sugar per packet} = \frac{11 \, \text{kg}}{12} \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Division
To divide 11 by 12:

- Performing long division, 11 divided by 12 gives a quotient of 0, since 11 is less than 12.
- The remainder is 11, making this a fraction that is proper, and thus can be directly expressed as a decimal.
- To express this fraction as a decimal, we can divide 11 by 12, which results in aproximating :\(
11 \div 12 = 0.91666\ldots \).
Let's round this decimal to three decimal places for practical usage.
  
Therefore, \( 11 \div 12 \approx 0.917 \).

### Conclusion:
The weight of sugar in each packet is approximately 0.917 kg.

A portion of a stick, \(\frac{1}{6}\), is in the ground, \(\frac{1}{2}\) is in the water, and the remaining part is above the water. The length of the part above the water is 2 meters. How many meters of the stick are in the ground?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Let the total length of the stick be \( L \) meters.
   - According to the problem:
     - \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the stick is in the ground.
     - \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the stick is in the water.
     - The remaining part of the stick, which is \(\frac{L}{above}\), is above water and measures 2 meters.

2. **Set up the Equation for the Remaining Part:**
   - Total fraction in use is the sum of the parts in the ground and in the water:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - The stick's part above the water (2 meters) is the remaining fraction of the stick:
     \[
     1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]
   - So, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3}L = 2
     \]

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get the total length \( L \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Find the Length of the Part in the Ground:**
   - Since \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the stick is in the ground:
     \[
     \text{Length in the ground} = \frac{1}{6} \times 6 = 1 \text{ meter}
     \]

## Conclusion:

The length of the stick that is in the ground is \( \boxed{1} \) meter.

The problem in English is: ""What will be the ratio of the angles in a right-angled isosceles triangle?""

## Step-by-step Solution:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are dealing with a right-angled isosceles triangle.
   - A right-angled triangle has one angle measuring \(90^\circ\).
   - An isosceles triangle has two sides (and thus two angles) that are equal.

2. **Analyzing an Isosceles Right-Angled Triangle:**
   - Since it is a right-angled triangle, one of the angles is \(90^\circ\).
   - The other two angles must be equal because it’s an isosceles triangle.

3. **Formulating the Equation:**
   - Let the measure of each of the equal angles be \(x\).
   - In any triangle, the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, we have the equation: 
     \[
     x + x + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplifying the above equation gives:
     \[
     2x + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Subtract \(90^\circ\) from both sides:
     \[
     2x = 90^\circ
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to find \(x\):
     \[
     x = 45^\circ
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The two equal angles each measure \(45^\circ\).
   - Therefore, the angles of the triangle are \(90^\circ\), \(45^\circ\), and \(45^\circ\).

6. **Finding the Ratio:**
   - The ratio of the angles in order from smallest to largest: \(45 : 45 : 90\).
   - This simplifies to the ratio \(1 : 1 : 2\).

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Oranges in the basket initially = \( x \).

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - According to the problem, half of these \( x \) oranges are given to grandfather.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges given to grandfather = \( \frac{x}{2} \).

3. **Remaining Oranges**:
   - After giving half to grandfather, 2 oranges are still left in the basket.
   - So, the equation to represent the remaining oranges is:
     \[
     x - \frac{x}{2} = 2
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 2
     \]
   - To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 4

The price of paddy at harvest time was 1080 taka per quintal. During the monsoon season, the price of paddy increased by 15%. If a farmer sold 12 quintals of paddy at harvest time, he would have received _____ taka more if he sold the same amount of paddy during the monsoon season.

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in earnings between selling the paddy at harvest time and during the monsoon season.

1. **Initial Price Calculation:**
   - The price per quintal of paddy at harvest time = 1080 taka.
   - The farmer sold 12 quintals.
   - Total earning at harvest time = Price per quintal × Number of quintals
   - Total earning at harvest time = 1080 taka/quintal × 12 quintals = 12,960 taka.

2. **Price Increase Calculation:**
   - The percentage increase in price during the monsoon is 15%.
   - Increased price per quintal during monsoon = Original Price + (Percentage Increase × Original Price)
   - Increased price per quintal during monsoon = 1080 taka + (15/100 × 1080 taka)
   - Calculate the increase: 15% of 1080 = 0.15 × 1080 = 162 taka
   - Increased price per quintal during monsoon = 1080 taka + 162 taka = 1,242 taka.

3. **Earnings Calculation during Monsoon:**
   - The new price per quintal is 1,242 taka during the monsoon.
   - Total earning during monsoon season = New price per quintal × Number of quintals
   - Total earning during monsoon season = 1,242 taka/quintal × 12 quintals = 14,904 taka.

4. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between monsoon selling and harvest time selling = Total earning during monsoon season - Total earning at harvest time
   - Difference = 14,904 taka - 12,960 taka = 1,944 taka.

Thus, if the farmer had sold the same amount of paddy during the monsoon season, he would have earned 1,944 taka more.

Translate the Bengali problem into English:

What is the smallest number that, when subtracted from 5834, the result will be divisible by 20, 28, 32, and 35?

## Solution:

### Step 1: Understand the problem

We need to find the smallest number \( x \) such that when subtracted from 5834, the result is divisible by 20, 28, 32, and 35. This is equivalent to finding the smallest number \( x \) such that \( 5834 - x \) is a common multiple of 20, 28, 32, and 35.

### Step 2: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)

To solve this, we first calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 20, 28, 32, and 35.

#### Prime factorization:
- 20 = \( 2^2 \times 5 \)
- 28 = \( 2^2 \times 7 \)
- 32 = \( 2^5 \)
- 35 = \( 5 \times 7 \)

#### LCM Calculation:

The LCM will take the highest power of each prime number appearing in the factorizations:

- Highest power of 2: \( 2^5 \) (from 32)
- Highest power of 5: \( 5^1 \) (from 20 and 35)
- Highest power of 7: \( 7^1 \) (from 28 and 35)

Thus, the LCM is:

\[
\text{LCM} = 2^5 \times 5 \times 7 = 32 \times 5 \times 7
\]

Calculate step-by-step:

- \( 32 \times 5 = 160 \)
- \( 160 \times 7 = 1120 \)

So, \(\text{LCM} = 1120\).

### Step 3: Determine the smallest \( x \)

We now need \( 5834 - x \) to be a multiple of 1120. This implies:

\[
5834 - x = k \times 1120
\]

for some integer \( k \). To find the smallest \( x \), we need the remainder of 5834 divided by 1120:

\[
5834 \div 1120 \approx 5.205

     \text{Maximum number of } 50 \text{ taka notes} = \left\lfloor \frac{190}{50} \right\rfloor = 3 \text{ notes} 
     \]
   - Using 3 notes of 50 taka: 
     \[
     3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ taka}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after using 50-taka notes**: 
   \[
   190 - 150 = 40 \text{ taka}
   \]

4. **Use the next largest denomination**: 20 taka
   - Calculate how many 20 taka notes are required to make up the remaining 40 taka:
     \[
     \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ notes}
     \]

5. **Use 2 notes of 20 taka**: 
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ taka}
   \]

6. **Verify the total amount and number of notes**:
   - 3 notes of 50 taka = 150 taka
   - 2 notes of 20 taka = 40 taka
   - Total = 150 + 40 = 190 taka

   - Total number of notes used: 
     \[
     3 \text{ (from 50 taka)} + 2 \text{ (from 20 taka)} = 5 \text{ notes}
     \]

By using 3 notes of 50 taka and 2 notes of 20 taka, Abeer can pay exactly 190 taka using the minimum number of notes.

A rectangular plot of land has its length three times its width, and the perimeter of the plot is 40 meters. Find the length of the plot in meters.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between length and width.
Let's denote the width of the plot as \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the plot is three times the width. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 3w \]

### Step 2: Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.
The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2(l + w) \]

### Step 3: Substitute the known perimeter and the relationship between length and width.
We know the perimeter is 40 meters, so we substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter formula:
\[ 40 = 2(3w + w) \]

### Step 4: Simplify and solve for \( w \).
Simplify the equation:
\[ 40 = 2(4w) \]
\[ 40 = 8w \]

Now, solve for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{40}{8} \]
\[ w = 5 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the length.
Since the length is three times the width, we have:
\[ l = 3w = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the length of the plot is 15 meters.

The largest four-digit perfect square number is _____.

### Detailed Solution:
To find the largest four-digit perfect square, we need to determine the largest perfect square that is a four-digit number. A four-digit number ranges from 1000 to 9999.

1. **Determine the Upper Limit for the Square Root:**
   - The largest four-digit number is 9999.
   - To find the square root, calculate \(\sqrt{9999}\).

2. **Calculate an Approximate Square Root:**
   - Start by estimating \(\sqrt{9999}\). Since 100^2 = 10000, and 9999 is slightly less than 10000, the square root will be slightly less than 100.
   - Testing 99: 
     \[
     99^2 = 99 \times 99 = 9801
     \]
   - Since 9801 is less than 9999, 99^2 is a valid four-digit perfect square.
   - Testing 100: 
     \[
     100^2 = 10000
     \]
   - Since 10000 is not a four-digit number, 100 is not suitable.

3. **Conclusion with Verification:**
   - The calculation confirms that the largest four-digit perfect square is 99^2.
   - Therefore, the largest four-digit perfect square number is 9801.

Find the largest number that, when dividing 2300 and 3500, leaves remainders of 32 and 56, respectively.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To tackle this problem, we need to find the largest common divisor of the numbers obtained by subtracting the remainders from the given numbers, since these are the results after division by the desired number.

1. **Determine the Effective Dividends:**

   - For 2300 with a remainder of 32, the effective number is \( 2300 - 32 = 2268 \).
   - For 3500 with a remainder of 56, the effective number is \( 3500 - 56 = 3444 \).

2. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**

   To find the largest number that divides both 2268 and 3444 perfectly, we must calculate the GCD of these two numbers.

3. **Use the Euclidean Algorithm:**

   - Start with the two numbers: 2268 and 3444.
   - Apply the Euclidean algorithm:
     - Divide 3444 by 2268: 
       \[
       \text{3444} \div \text{2268} = 1 \quad \text{remainder} = 3444 - 2268 \times 1 = 1176
       \]
     - Next, use 2268 and the remainder 1176:
       \[
       \text{2268} \div \text{1176} = 1 \quad \text{remainder} = 2268 - 1176 \times 1 = 1092
       \]
     - Next, use 1176 and the remainder 1092:
       \[
       \text{1176} \div \text{1092} = 1 \quad \text{remainder} = 1176 - 1092 \times 1 = 84
       \]
     - Next, use 1092 and the remainder 84:
       \[
       \text{1092} \div \text{84} = 13 \quad \text{remainder} = 1092 - 84 \times 13 = 0
       \]

   When the remainder reaches 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 84.

In a cricket match, the total number of runs scored by Iman and Suman is 58. Iman's score is 5 runs less than twice Suman's score. What is Iman's score in that match?

### Solution Step-by-Step:

Let's use algebra to solve the problem. We will denote:
- \( x \) as the runs scored by Suman.
- \( y \) as the runs scored by Iman.

According to the problem, we have two equations based on the given conditions:

1. The total runs by Iman and Suman is 58:
   \[
   x + y = 58
   \]

2. Iman's runs are 5 less than twice Suman's runs:
   \[
   y = 2x - 5
   \]

Now, we have the following system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases} 
x + y = 58 \\ 
y = 2x - 5 
\end{cases}
\]

### Substitution Method:

Substitute the expression for \( y \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
x + (2x - 5) = 58
\]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[
x + 2x - 5 = 58
\]
\[
3x - 5 = 58
\]
\[
3x = 58 + 5
\]
\[
3x = 63
\]
\[
x = \frac{63}{3}
\]
\[
x = 21
\]

Now that we have \( x = 21 \), which represents Suman's score, we can find Iman's score \( y \) using the expression for \( y \):

\[
y = 2x - 5
\]
\[
y = 2(21) - 5
\]
\[
y = 42 - 5
\]
\[
y = 37
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Iman's score in the match was **37**.

The length of a room's floor is 4 meters and the width is 3.5 meters. The height of the room is 3 meters, and its walls are 15 cm thick. What is the volume of the four walls of the room in cubic meters?

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Dimensions**:
   - Length of the room: \( L = 4 \) meters
   - Width of the room: \( W = 3.5 \) meters
   - Height of the room: \( H = 3 \) meters
   - Thickness of the walls: \( T = 15 \) cm = 0.15 meters (since 1 meter = 100 cm)

2. **Calculate the Area of the Room's Walls**:
   - The room consists of four walls: two pairs of opposite walls having different dimensions.
   - Pair 1 (two longer walls): Height \( \times \) width, with each wall having dimensions \( H \times (W - 2T) \)
   - Pair 2 (two shorter walls): Height \( \times \) length, with each wall having dimensions \( H \times (L - 2T) \)

A sum of 6500 taka amounts to 8840 taka in 4 years at a certain rate of interest. At the same rate of interest, how much money will amount to 10200 taka in 4 years?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, let's first understand what we are dealing with. We are given a principal amount (P1) which becomes a maturity amount (A1) after 4 years at a certain interest rate, and we need to find another principal amount (P2) that will grow to a different maturity amount (A2) in the same period and at the same interest rate.

Let's list the parameters for the first scenario:
- Principal (P1) = 6500 Taka
- Amount after 4 years (A1) = 8840 Taka
- Interest Time (T) = 4 years

We first need to calculate the rate of interest using the simple interest formula:
The formula for the amount in terms of principal and simple interest is:
\[ A = P + SI \]
\[ SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]
So:
\[ A = P + \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]
\[ 8840 = 6500 + \frac{6500 \times R \times 4}{100} \]
Subtract 6500 from both sides:
\[ 2340 = \frac{6500 \times R \times 4}{100} \]
\[ 2340 = 260R \]
Now solve for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{2340}{260} \]
\[ R = 9 \% \]

Now, let's apply the same rate of 9% to find out the principal required for maturity amount 10200 in 4 years:

Using the same formula for the second scenario:
- Amount after 4 years (A2) = 10200 Taka
- Rate of Interest (R) = 9%
- Time (T) = 4 years

Let the required principal be P2. Then:
\[ 10200 = P2 + \frac{P2 \times 9 \times 4}{100} \]
\[ 10200 = P2 + \frac{36 \times P2}{100} \]
\[ 10200 = P2 \left(1 + \frac{36}{100}\right) \]

The sum of three consecutive natural numbers is 63. What is the smallest number?

## Solution:
Let's denote the smallest of these three consecutive natural numbers as \( x \).

Since the numbers are consecutive, the next two numbers would be \( x + 1 \) and \( x + 2 \).

According to the problem, the sum of these numbers is 63. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 63
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
3x + 3 = 63
\]

To isolate \( x \), we first subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
3x = 60
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 20
\]

Thus, the smallest of the three consecutive natural numbers is 20.

Raju and Roni together have 690 lychees. Raju has 86 fewer lychees than Roni. How many lychees does Raju have?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let's denote the number of lychees Raju has as \( R_{raju} \) and the number of lychees Roni has as \( R_{roni} \).

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   According to the problem, the total number of lychees Raju and Roni have is 690. This gives us our first equation:
   \[
   R_{raju} + R_{roni} = 690
   \]
   Additionally, Raju has 86 fewer lychees than Roni, which gives us our second equation:
   \[
   R_{raju} = R_{roni} - 86
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   Substitute the expression for \( R_{raju} \) from the second equation into the first equation:
   \[
   (R_{roni} - 86) + R_{roni} = 690
   \]
   Simplify and solve for \( R_{roni} \):
   \[
   2R_{roni} - 86 = 690
   \]
   \[
   2R_{roni} = 690 + 86

Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln are three brothers. Their father distributed 6300 taka among them. In this distribution, Sabuj received 3/5 of Dalim’s share and Dalim received twice the amount Lincoln received. What is the amount of money Dalim received?

## Step-by-Step Solution:

Let's denote the amount Lincoln received as \( x \).

1. **Dalim's Share:**
   - According to the problem, Dalim received twice the amount Lincoln received.
   - Therefore, Dalim's share is:
   \[
   \text{Dalim's share} = 2x
   \]

2. **Sabuj's Share:**
   - Sabuj received 3/5 of Dalim's share.
   - Therefore, Sabuj's share is:
   \[
   \text{Sabuj's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 2x = \frac{6x}{5}
   \]

3. **Total Sum Distribution:**
   - According to the problem, the total amount distributed is 6300 taka. Therefore, the equation is:
   \[
   \text{Sabuj's share} + \text{Dalim's share} + \text{Lincoln's share} = 6300
   \]
   \[
   \frac{6x}{5} + 2x + x = 6300
   \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Convert the equation to a common denominator and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{6x}{5} + \frac{10x}{5} + \frac{5x}{5} = 6300
   \]
   \[
   \frac{21x}{5} = 6300
   \]

5. **Finding \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   21x = 6300 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   21x = 31500
   \]
   - Divide by 21 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{31500}{21}
   \]
   \[
   x = 1500
   \]

6. **Calculating Dalim's Share:**
   - We know Dalim’s share is twice that of Lincoln’s share"

Given the ratios \( A : B = 4 : 7 \) and \( B : C = 10 : 7 \), find the combined ratio \( A : B : C \).

## Solution:
To find the combined ratio \( A : B : C \), we need to adjust the given ratios so that the value of \( B \) is the same in both ratios. 

### Step 1: Align the Ratios
The ratios given are:
1. \( A : B = 4 : 7 \)
2. \( B : C = 10 : 7 \)

To combine these ratios, we first need to equate the values representing \( B \). In order to do so, we must find a common multiple of the \( B \) parts from each ratio, which are 7 and 10.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 10 is 70.

### Step 2: Scale the Ratios
- Scale the ratio \( A : B = 4 : 7 \) such that the \( B \) component becomes 70. Multiply both sides by 10:
  \[
  A : B = 4 \times 10 : 7 \times 10 = 40 : 70
  \]

- Scale the ratio \( B : C = 10 : 7 \) such that the \( B \) component becomes 70. Multiply both sides by 7:
  \[
  B : C = 10 \times 7 : 7 \times 7 = 70 : 49
  \]

### Step 3: Combine the Ratios
Now, as both the ratios have the same \( B \) component, we can write the combined ratio of \( A : B : C \) as follows:
\[ 
A : B : C = 40 : 70 : 49 
\]

### Conclusion
By aligning the components tied to \( B \), we find that the combined ratio of \( A : B : C \) is \( 40 : 70 : 49 \).

   A car's selling price is equal to 4/5 of its purchase price. What percentage profit or loss will occur?

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   Let's denote:
   - The purchase price of the car as \( P \).
   - The selling price of the car as \( S \).
   - According to the problem, the selling price \( S \) is equal to 4/5 of the purchase price \( P \).

   Mathematically, we can express this relationship as:
   \[
   S = \frac{4}{5}P
   \]

   To determine whether there is a profit or a loss, we compare the selling price \( S \) with the purchase price \( P \).

   \[
   \text{Loss} = P - S
   \]

   Substituting the expression for \( S \), we have:
   \[
   \text{Loss} = P - \frac{4}{5}P = P - 0.8P = 0.2P
   \]

   Now, we need to calculate the percentage loss. Percentage loss is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Loss} = \left(\frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

   Substituting the value of the loss:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Loss} = \left(\frac{0.2P}{P}\right) \times 100\% = 0.2 \times 100\% = 20\%

   \[
   P = 4000 \text{ taka}
   \]

5. **Determine the Interest:**
   - The interest, as given, is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the principal.
   - So, the interest amount \( I = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ taka} \).

6. **Find the Number of Years:**
   - The annual interest is given as 8%, therefore:
   \[
   \text{Interest for one year} = \frac{8}{100} \times 4000 = 320 \text{ taka}
   \]
   - The total interest for \( n \) years is 1600 taka, so:
   \[
   320n = 1600
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{1600}{320} = 5
   \]

Therefore, the number of years required is 5 years.

In the Chatterjee neighborhood library, there are 2100 storybooks. An additional 30% of the number of storybooks was purchased. Calculate the total number of storybooks in the library now.

## Solution:
To find the total number of storybooks now in the library, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Number of Storybooks**: 
   The library initially has 2100 storybooks.

2. **Additional Storybooks Purchased**:
   - We need to calculate 30% of the initial number of storybooks.
   - 30% of 2100 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{30\% of 2100} = \frac{30}{100} \times 2100 = 0.3 \times 2100
     \]
   - Calculate the result of the above multiplication:
     \[
     0.3 \times 2100 = 630
     \]
   So, an additional 630 storybooks were purchased.

3. **Total Number of Storybooks Now**:
   - Add the initial number of storybooks and the additional storybooks purchased:
     \[
     2100 + 630 = 2730
     \]

Therefore, the total number of storybooks in the library now is 2730.

445,"কিছু টাকা লাবিব , সামি ও সিয়াম এর মধ্যে ৫ : ৪ : ২ অনুপাতে ভাগ করে দেওয়া হলো। সিয়াম ১৮০ টাকা পেলে সামি _____  টাকা পাবে নির্ণয় কর।",৩৬০,"### Translation of the Problem

Some money is divided among Labib, Sami, and Siam in the ratio 5:4:2. If Siam receives 180 taka, determine how much Sami will receive.

### Step-by-step Solution

1. **Understand the Ratio Distribution**

   The money is split among Labib, Sami, and Siam in the ratio of 5:4:2. This means if the parts of the money are divided into \(5x\), \(4x\), and \(2x\) respectively, these parts represent the amounts received by Labib, Sami, and Siam.

2. **Calculate the Value of \(x\)**

   Given that Siam, who receives the smallest share, obtains 180 taka, we can set up the equation:
   
   \[
   2x = 180
   \]

   To find \(x\), divide both sides by 2:

   \[
   x = \frac{180}{2} = 90
   \]

3. **Determine Sami's Share**

   Since Sami's share is represented by \(4x\), we can calculate it as:

   \[
   4x = 4 \times 90 = 360
   \]

4. **Conclude with the Answer**

   Sami will receive 360 taka.

**Answer: 360**"
