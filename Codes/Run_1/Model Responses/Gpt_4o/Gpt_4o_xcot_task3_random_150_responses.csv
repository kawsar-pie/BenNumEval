**Question:** Zorina observed that a pencil rolling over gravel produced 76 joules of heat and 25 calories of heat when she rolled it over a carpet. Did the pencil move slowly?

**Option 1:** Carpet

**Option 2:** Gravel

## Solution Step-by-Step:

To determine whether the pencil moved slowly, we need to understand the relationship between the mechanical action (rolling of the pencil) and the heat generated.

1. **Understanding the Units:**
   - 1 calorie = 4.184 joules.
   - 76 joules of heat is already in joules.
   - 25 calories of heat = 25 × 4.184 = 104.6 joules.

2. **Heat Generation Analysis:**
   - Over the **gravel**, the pencil generates 76 joules.
   - Over the **carpet**, the pencil generates 104.6 joules.

3. **Interpreting the Results:**
   - When the pencil rolls over gravel, it generates less heat (76 joules) compared to when it rolls over the carpet (104.6 joules).
   - Higher friction typically results in more heat generation.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If the pencil is moving slowly, it would typically generate less heat as less kinetic energy would be converted into thermal energy due to friction.
   - Since more heat (104.6 joules) is generated when moved over the carpet, the pencil likely experiences more friction there, suggesting it might be rolling slower over the carpet due to higher frictional force opposing its motion compared to gravel.

Therefore, considering the heat generation from friction, Zorina observed the pencil moving more slowly over the carpet.

### Question:
Dylan throws a pebble, with a mass of 0.2 kg, and a toy basketball, with a mass of 100 grams, out the window. Which had a stronger gravitational pull because its mass is greater?

### Options:
- Option 1: Pebble
- Option 2: Basketball

## Solution:

The question is asking which object experiences a stronger gravitational pull due to its mass. The gravitational force acting on an object near the Earth's surface is determined by its mass and is given by the formula:

\[ F = m \cdot g \]

where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force,
- \( m \) is the mass of the object,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on Earth's surface).

To determine which object has a stronger gravitational pull, we need to compare their masses:

1. **Mass of the Pebble:**
   - Given:
     \[
     \text{Mass of the pebble} = 0.2 \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Mass of the Basketball:**
   - Given:
     \[
     \text{Mass of the basketball} = 100 \, \text{grams} = 0.1 \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - (Note: Conversion from grams to kilograms is needed to maintain consistent units.)

3. **Comparison of Masses:**
   - **Pebble:** \( 0.2 \, \text{kg} \)
   - **Basketball:** \( 0.1 \, \text{kg} \)

Since the mass of the pebble (0.2 kg) is greater than the mass of the basketball (0.1 kg), the gravitational force (weight) acting on the pebble will be greater. This is because gravitational force is directly proportional to mass, and a greater mass results in a stronger gravitational pull.

Therefore, the object with the stronger gravitational pull is the pebble.

**Question**: From my house, the sound of the police siren is at a distance of 200 feet. As it moves to a distance of 175 feet from my house, what happens to the sound of the siren?

**Option 1**: Increased

**Option 2**: Decreased

## Step-by-step Solution

1. **Understanding Sound Intensity and Distance**: Sound intensity follows the inverse square law, which states that intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. In simple terms, as the distance from a sound source decreases, the sound intensity increases, and vice versa.

2. **Initial Distance**: The siren is initially at a distance of 200 feet from the house. 

3. **Final Distance**: The siren moves closer to a distance of 175 feet from the house.

4. **Effect on Sound**: Since the sound intensity increases as the distance decreases (according to the inverse square law), moving from 200 feet to 175 feet means the siren is now closer to the house. Thus, the sound intensity at the house increases.

5. **Conclusion**: As the distance from 200 feet to 175 feet decreases, the sound of the siren heard from the house indeed increases. 

Thus, based on the analysis, the correct option is that the sound increased.

**Question:**  
Lisa was playing with two model rockets. When she launched both rockets into the sky at the same time, after 30 seconds, the black one was 45 meters above the ground, and the red one was 31 meters above the ground. Which one had a higher speed?

- **Option 1:** The red one
- **Option 2:** The black one

## Step-by-Step Solution

To determine which rocket had a higher speed, we need to compare the distances each traveled in the same amount of time. The speed of an object is calculated by the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Let's calculate the speed of both rockets using the given distances and the time of 30 seconds.

1. **Speed of the black rocket:**

   - Distance traveled by the black rocket = 45 meters
   - Time taken = 30 seconds

   \[ \text{Speed of black rocket} = \frac{45 \text{ meters}}{30 \text{ seconds}} = 1.5 \text{ meters/second} \]

2. **Speed of the red rocket:**

   - Distance traveled by the red rocket = 31 meters
   - Time taken = 30 seconds

   \[ \text{Speed of red rocket} = \frac{31 \text{ meters}}{30 \text{ seconds}} \approx 1.033 \text{ meters/second} \]

## Conclusion

Comparing the two speeds:

- Speed of the black rocket: 1.5 meters/second
- Speed of the red rocket: 1.033 meters/second

The black rocket has a higher speed than the red rocket.

   - Question: Josh has noticed that lifting his niece (weight 45 pounds) is harder compared to lifting his son (weight 60 pounds). Does his niece have more gravitational pull?
   - Option 1: More
   - Option 2: Less

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:**

   In physics, the gravitational pull or gravitational force exerted by an object is directly proportional to its mass. This means that the more the mass an object has, the greater the gravitational pull it experiences. The formula to calculate the gravitational force (weight) on an object near the Earth's surface is:

   \[
   F = m \times g
   \]

   where \( F \) is the gravitational force (weight), \( m \) is the mass of the object, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, which is a constant value approximately equal to \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

   - **Calculations:**
     - For Josh's niece:
       \[
       F_{\text{niece}} = 45 \text{ pounds}
       \]
       (Note: Since weight itself is given, we consider it directly as the gravitational force in pounds.)
  
     - For Josh's son:
       \[
       F_{\text{son}} = 60 \text{ pounds}
       \]

   Comparing the gravitational forces (weights) of his niece and son, it is clear: 

   \[
   45 \, \text{pounds} < 60 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

   This indicates that his son has more gravitational pull than his niece because he has a greater weight.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Josh's niece does not have more gravitational pull compared to his son, because her weight (which reflects the gravitational pull on her) is less than that of his son.

### Question:
Tim's ring rolls 4.5 centimeters on the field and 1.2 centimeters on the floor. Tim's _____ is smoother.

### Options:
- **Option 1:** Floor
- **Option 2:** Field

## Solution:
To determine which surface is smoother, we can consider the distance the ring rolls on each surface without additional force being applied. In general, a surface that allows an object to roll further with the same applied force is smoother due to less friction.

1. **Understanding the Concept of Smoothness:**
   - A surface is considered smoother if there is less resistance (i.e., less friction) to motion. On a smoother surface, objects tend to roll further compared to a rougher surface when the same force is applied.

2. **Comparing the Distances:**
   - On the field, the ring rolls 4.5 centimeters.
   - On the floor, the ring rolls 1.2 centimeters.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the ring rolls a greater distance on the field than on the floor with presumably the same initial push or force applied, it implies that the field offers less resistance or friction to the rolling ring.
   - Therefore, the field is smoother because the ring is able to roll a greater distance due to lower friction.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the field allows the ring to roll further than the floor, the correct reasoning leads to the conclusion that the field is smoother.

Thus, the field is smoother than the floor.

### Options:
- Option 1: Bicycle
- Option 2: Car

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two modes of transport: a car and a bicycle.
   - The speed of the car is 56 meters per second (m/s).
   - The speed of the bicycle is 12 meters per second (m/s).
   - We need to determine which mode of transport is slower, meaning which has the lower speed.

2. **Comparing Speeds:**

   - Speed of Bicycle: 12 m/s

3. **Determining the Slower Mode:**
   - The bicycle travels at 12 m/s, whereas the car travels at 56 m/s.
   - Since 12 m/s (bicycle) is less than 56 m/s (car), the bicycle is slower than the car.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The slower mode of transport is the bicycle.

Therefore, the slower option is the Bicycle.

### Question:
Ted was riding his bike in the park. When he was on the cement path, he was able to zip around the park in 50 seconds, and on the grass, he took 4 minutes. Where will the bike get hotter?

### Options:
- Option 1: On the cement path
- Option 2: On the grass

## Step-by-Step Solution

To determine where the bike will get hotter, we need to consider the factors that contribute to the heating of a bicycle when it is ridden, which mainly include speed and the type of surface.

1. **Time on Different Surfaces**:
   - Time on cement: 50 seconds.
   - Time on grass: 4 minutes (which equals 240 seconds).

2. **Speed and Friction Analysis**:
   - On the cement path, Ted completes the journey much faster (50 seconds) compared to when he's on the grass (240 seconds). This indicates that Ted is moving much faster on the cement.
   - Generally, friction is a significant factor in heating. Cement offers less rolling resistance and friction compared to grass, allowing for higher speeds.

3. **Heating Factors**:
   - Higher speeds typically result in less direct frictional heating because the movement is smoother. However, moving faster can increase the mechanical work output and under certain conditions, heat generation due to air resistance and mechanical work can occur. But for a bicycle, the dominant factor is surface friction.
   - Grass provides more resistance (friction), resulting in greater heat generation due to the increased effort required by the bike to travel over it.

4. **Conclusion Based on Analysis**:
   - Despite the higher speed on cement, the lower friction of this surface makes it less likely for the bike to heat up significantly due to rolling friction.
   - Riding on grass is slower due to higher friction, leading to more energy being expended for the same distance, thus generating more heat.

Therefore, the bike will get hotter when riding on the grass.

**Question in English:**
Kate is in a movie theater and accidentally drops her cup on the floor. The cup rolls over a concrete floor for 3 seconds, which is 25 centimeters long, but after hitting a carpeted floor, it goes 0.18 meters in 3 seconds. The cup rolled faster on the concrete floor because the concrete floor had?

**Options:**
- **Option 1:** More friction
- **Option 2:** Less friction

## Solution with Explanations

To determine the reason why the cup rolled faster on the concrete floor compared to the carpeted floor, we need to understand the concepts of friction and how they affect motion.

1. **Understanding Friction:**
   - Friction is the force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact. The amount of friction depends on the nature of the surfaces.
   - Surfaces like concrete, which are smoother and harder, usually have less friction compared to softer and rougher surfaces like carpet.

2. **Motion on Concrete vs. Carpet:**
   - The cup rolls a shorter distance (in terms of relative motion) on the carpeted floor than on the concrete floor in the same amount of time.
   - This indicates that the resistance to motion (friction) is greater on the carpeted floor, which slows down the cup more quickly than the concrete floor.

3. **Comparing Friction on Both Surfaces:**
   - Since the concrete floor allowed the cup to roll further in 3 seconds compared to the carpeted floor, it can be deduced that the concrete floor provided less resistance to motion.
   - Hence, the concrete floor had less friction than the carpeted floor.

Therefore, the cup rolled faster on the concrete floor because the concrete floor had less friction.

## Conclusion

Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is **Option 2: Less friction**.

### Question:
A mammoth moves through a water hole at a speed of 18 kilometers per hour, but travels over hard dirt at a speed of 18 miles per hour because the hard dirt was?

### Options:
- Option 1: More resistant
- Option 2: Less resistant

## Solution

To determine the correct option, we need to understand the effect of resistance on the mammoth's speed.

1. **Understanding Resistance and Speed**: 
   - If a surface is more resistant, it requires more effort for an object or being (in this case, a mammoth) to move across it, typically resulting in slower movement.
   - Conversely, if a surface is less resistant, it is easier to traverse, leading to faster movement.

2. **Speed Comparison**:
   - In the problem, the mammoth travels at 18 kilometers per hour in water. Water offers resistance due to its fluid nature, which can slow down movement.
   - On hard dirt, the mammoth travels at 18 miles per hour. Before checking resistance, it's critical to convert either both speeds to kilometers or both to miles for accurate comparison.

3. **Unit Conversion**:
   - We need to compare speeds in the same unit to understand the situation better. Using the conversion factor where 1 mile ≈ 1.60934 kilometers:
   - 18 miles per hour = 18 * 1.60934 kilometers per hour = 28.96812 kilometers per hour.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The speed over hard dirt (28.96812 km/h) is greater than the speed through the water (18 km/h).
   - This indicates that hard dirt offers less resistance than water, allowing the mammoth to move more swiftly over it.

### Conclusion:
The mammoth's ability to travel faster on hard dirt suggests that the hard dirt offered less resistance compared to water.

**Options Translation:**
- Option 1: Red
- Option 2: Green

## Detailed Solution in English

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Ian's red train travels at a speed of 39 kilometers per hour.
- Avery's green train travels at a speed of 23 kilometers per hour.
- Both trains are traveling to a destination that is 40 miles away.

### Step 2: Convert the distance from miles to kilometers
Given that 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 kilometers, the total distance to the destination in kilometers is:

\[ 40 \text{ miles} \times 1.60934 \text{ km/mile} = 64.3736 \text{ km} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the time taken by each train to reach the destination

**Time taken by Ian's red train:**
- Speed = 39 km/hr
- Distance = 64.3736 km

Using the formula: 
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{red} = \frac{64.3736 \text{ km}}{39 \text{ km/hr}} \approx 1.6516 \text{ hours} \]

**Time taken by Avery's green train:**
- Speed = 23 km/hr
- Distance = 64.3736 km

\[ \text{Time}_{green} = \frac{64.3736 \text{ km}}{23 \text{ km/hr}} \approx 2.7993 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 4: Compare the time taken
- Ian’s red train takes approximately 1.6516 hours.
- Avery’s green train takes approximately 2.7993 hours.

The slower train is the one that takes more time. In this case, Avery’s green train takes longer to reach the destination.

   - Option 1: Marble floor
   - Option 2: Sand

2. **Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:**

   To determine which surface is smoother, we need to understand how different surfaces affect the rolling distance of a ball. A smoother surface offers less resistance or friction to the rolling ball, allowing it to travel further before coming to a stop.

   - **Observation from the problem:**
     - On the marble floor, the pool ball rolls 180 centimeters.
     - On the sand, the pool ball rolls only 27 centimeters.

   - **Analysis:**
     The pool ball travels a significantly greater distance on the marble floor compared to the sand. This indicates that the marble floor provides less resistance to the ball's motion, meaning it has lower friction compared to sand.

   - **Conclusion:**
     Since a smoother surface allows the ball to roll a greater distance, the marble floor must be the smoother surface. Sand tends to be uneven and has a higher frictional coefficient, which explains why the ball rolls a much shorter distance.

3. **Correct option:**

   Based on the analysis above, the smoother surface is the one where the pool ball rolls further, which is the marble floor.

### Question:
Elliot notices that he is able to push a handcart at a speed of 19 m/s on cement and at 23 m/s on carpet. Where will the handcart generate more heat?

### Options:
1. On carpet
2. On cement

## Solution

To determine where more heat is generated, we need to consider the concept of frictional forces and energy dissipation. When a handcart is pushed over a surface, friction between the cart and the surface causes some of the mechanical energy to be converted into heat. The amount of heat generated due to friction depends on two major factors:

1. The frictional force between the surface and the handcart.
2. The distance over which this force acts, which is also affected by the speed.

### Analysis:

1. **Friction and Generation of Heat:**
   - Friction is generally higher on rough surfaces. Carpets tend to have a higher coefficient of friction compared to cement.
   - More friction means more heat generation, as the kinetic energy of the moving cart is more significantly converted into thermal energy.

2. **Speed and Friction:**
   - Although Elliot can push the cart faster on the carpet (23 m/s) compared to cement (19 m/s), the primary concern for heat generation is the frictional force and the nature of the surfaces involved.

3. **Impact on Heat Generation:**
   - Higher friction on the carpet means more energy lost as heat despite the increased speed. 
   - On smoother surfaces like cement, the lesser friction would lead to less heat generated relative to the same movement on a rougher surface like a carpet.

Therefore, given that carpets generally exhibit higher friction compared to cement, and considering the conversion of kinetic energy to heat due to this friction, the handcart will likely generate more heat on the carpet.

Thus, the correct answer is that more heat will be generated when the handcart is pushed over the carpet.

### Question:
Jim owns both a truck and a car. The truck is 13025 kilograms heavier than the car. Which vehicle will accelerate more quickly when the gas pedal is pressed?

### Options:
Option 1: Truck  
Option 2: Car

## Solution

To determine which vehicle will accelerate more quickly, we need to consider the principle of physics related to acceleration, specifically Newton's Second Law of Motion:  
\[ F = ma \]  
Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied,
- \( m \) is the mass of the object,
- \( a \) is the acceleration.

Assuming the same force is applied to both the truck and the car when Jim presses the gas pedal, the acceleration (\( a \)) will depend on the mass (\( m \)) of the vehicle. The formula for acceleration, derived from the second law, is given by:  
\[ a = \frac{F}{m} \]

Now, let's compare the two vehicles:
- **Truck**: Heavier by 13025 kilograms compared to the car.
- **Car**: Lighter compared to the truck.

Since the car is lighter, its mass (\( m \)) is less than that of the truck. Given the same force, the car will have a greater acceleration because acceleration is inversely proportional to mass.

Azhmira scored 25 out of 50 in handwork at school. In Ali's school, Ali scored 10 out of 25 in handwork. Let's calculate who scored a higher percentage.

**Translation of the Options:**

- Option 1: Azhmira
- Option 2: Ali

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To determine who scored a higher percentage, we need to calculate the percentage scores for both Azhmira and Ali.

**1. Calculate Azhmira's percentage:**

- Azhmira scored 25 out of 50.
- The formula for percentage is: \(\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Score Obtained}}{\text{Total Score}}\right) \times 100\)

\[
\text{Azhmira's Percentage} = \left(\frac{25}{50}\right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

**2. Calculate Ali's percentage:**

- Ali scored 10 out of 25.
- Using the same percentage formula:

\[
\text{Ali's Percentage} = \left(\frac{10}{25}\right) \times 100 = 40\%
\]

**Comparison:**

- Azhmira's percentage is 50%.
- Ali's percentage is 40%.

Since 50% is greater than 40%, Azhmira scored a higher percentage than Ali.

**Conclusion:**

The correct option, based on who scored a higher percentage, is **Azhmira**.

**Question:** Rod was rolling a ball towards his dog. He was able to roll the ball 5 meters on cement and 2 meters on grass. What is the reason for the cement?  
**Option 1:** Rough  
**Option 2:** Smooth  

### Solution

1. **Understanding the Scenario:**
   - A ball is rolled by Rod, and it travels different distances on two different surfaces: cement and grass.
   - On cement, the ball travels 5 meters.
   - On grass, the ball travels 2 meters.

2. **Analyzing Surface Characteristics:**
   - Cement and grass have different textures and hence different frictional properties.
   - **Cement:** Generally, cement surfaces are smooth, which means they have lower friction compared to rough surfaces. This lower friction allows objects to roll or slide over them more easily and for longer distances.
   - **Grass:** Grass surfaces are not smooth; they offer more resistance (higher friction) due to their uneven and soft nature. This higher friction results in the ball rolling for a shorter distance.

3. **Explanation of Distance Differences:**
   - The ball rolls further on the cement because the smooth surface of the cement reduces friction, thus allowing the ball to travel a longer distance.
   - Conversely, the ball doesn't roll as far on grass due to higher friction, which slows it down more quickly.

4. **Identifying the Correct Option:**
   - The question asks for the characteristic of the cement that allows the ball to roll 5 meters compared to 2 meters on grass.
   - Since smooth surfaces lead to less friction and therefore longer rolling distances, the correct reason for why the ball rolls further on the cement is because the cement is smooth.

### Question:
Jim lives 100 kilometers away from the server. Zarina lives 9700 miles away from the server. If both have the same internet speed, whose ping will be higher?

### Options:
- Option 1: Jim
- Option 2: Zarina

## Detailed Solution:

**Understanding Ping:**

1. **Ping** is a measure of the time it takes for a small packet of data to travel from a computer to a server and back. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms).

2. The primary factor affecting ping is the distance between the device and the server. The greater the distance, the longer it generally takes for the data to make the round trip, resulting in a higher ping.

**Comparative Distances:**

1. **Conversion of Units:**
   - 1 kilometer (km) is approximately 0.621371 miles.
   - Therefore, 100 kilometers is about 100 * 0.621371 = 62.1371 miles.
   
2. **Comparing Distances:**
   - Jim's distance from the server: 62.1371 miles
   - Zarina's distance from the server: 9700 miles

3. Clearly, Zarina is much farther from the server than Jim is (9700 miles vs. 62.1371 miles).

**Conclusion Based on Distance:**

- Since Zarina is significantly farther from the server compared to Jim, her ping will be higher due to the increased distance and the time it takes for the data packets to travel to and from the server.

**Final Answer:**

Given that Jim is much closer to the server compared to Zarina, his ping will be lower, and thus, Zarina will have the higher ping.

**Question:** Shap and Chris are driving on the same road at the same speed. However, Shap has traveled for 120 seconds and Chris has traveled for 1 minute. As a result?
- **Option 1:** Shap traveled more than Chris
- **Option 2:** Shap did not travel more than Chris

**Solution:**

To determine who traveled more, we need to compare the travel times of both Shap and Chris, given that their speeds are equal.

1. **Convert Chris's travel time from minutes to seconds:**
   - Chris travels for 1 minute. 
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds.

2. **Compare travel times:**
   - Shap's travel time: 120 seconds.
   - Chris's travel time: 60 seconds.

Since both are traveling at the same speed, the distance each travels can be calculated using the formula: 

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Because their speeds are the same and Shap's travel time of 120 seconds is longer than Chris's travel time of 60 seconds, it follows logically that:

- **Shap travels a greater distance than Chris.**

**Conclusion:**

Shap, traveling for 120 seconds, covers more distance than Chris, who travels for only 60 seconds, assuming their speeds are identical.

**Question:** The swimming speed of a turtle in a pond is 12 meters/second, whereas in the sea it is 2.8 meters/second, because _____ is smoother?

**Option 1:** Pond  
**Option 2:** Ocean

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**  
   We are given the swimming speeds of a turtle in two different environments: a pond and the sea. The turtle swims faster in the pond at 12 meters/second compared to 2.8 meters/second in the sea.

2. **Analyzing the Options:**
   - **Option 1: Pond**  
     This suggests that if the pond is smoother, it would allow the turtle to swim faster due to less resistance or turbulence in the water.
   - **Option 2: Ocean**  
     This posits that the ocean is smoother, which contradicts the observation since the turtle swims slower in the ocean.

3. **Understanding Amplitude of Smoothness:**
   - When evaluating the smoothness of water, smoother surfaces lead to less drag and thus allow for greater speeds. This implies that the faster speed in the pond is likely due to smoother conditions compared to those of the ocean.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Based on the speeds, it is logical to deduce that the pond provides a smoother environment for the turtle, allowing it to swim faster than in the ocean. Hence, the correct option is that the pond is smoother.

**Question:** By driving, Mary learned that the coefficient of friction in the forest is 0.8, whereas the coefficient on the road is 0.4. Where can she drive her car faster?

**Options:**
- **Option 1:** In the forest
- **Option 2:** On the road

## Detailed Solution:

The maximum speed at which a car can safely travel is influenced by the coefficient of friction between its tires and the driving surface. The frictional force \( F \) that determines how well the tires grip is given by:

\[
F = \mu \times N
\]

where \( \mu \) is the coefficient of friction and \( N \) is the normal force, which is proportional to the car's weight (and is usually the same on flat surfaces).

- A higher coefficient of friction (\( \mu \)) means better tire grip, allowing the car to travel at higher speeds without skidding.
- Conversely, a lower coefficient of friction indicates less grip, which means the car must move slower to avoid losing control.

In this problem:
- The forest has a friction coefficient (\( \mu \)) of 0.8.
- The road has a friction coefficient (\( \mu \)) of 0.4.

Now, comparing the coefficients:
- **0.8 is greater than 0.4.**

Since the forest has a higher coefficient of friction compared to the road, Mary's car will have better traction and can therefore be driven faster in the forest than on the road, assuming other factors like road conditions and visibility remain constant.

**Conclusion:** Mary can drive faster in the forest because it allows greater maximum speed due to its higher friction coefficient.

**Question:**
If both a car and a pickup travel at a speed of 60 miles per hour, but the car stops after 2 hours while the pickup stops after 6 hours, which one covers less distance?

**Option 1:** Car  
**Option 2:** Pickup

## Solution:

1. **Identify the Given Data:**
   - **Speed of both vehicles:** 60 miles per hour.
   - **Time taken by the car:** 2 hours.
   - **Time taken by the pickup:** 6 hours.

2. **Calculate the Distance Covered by Each Vehicle:**

   The formula for distance is given by:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]

   - **Distance covered by the car:**
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}

**Question:** A rolling marble creates a resistance of 5 Newtons on dirt and 73 Newtons on sand. Where can the marble travel further?

**Option 1:** Sand  
**Option 2:** Dirt

### Solution:

To determine where the marble can travel further, we need to consider the resistance force exerted by the surfaces on the marble. The resistance force is an opposing force that slows down the marble, so a higher resistance force means the marble will lose its speed more quickly and travel a shorter distance.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Resistance on Dirt:**
   - The resistance force on dirt is given as 5 Newtons.

2. **Resistance on Sand:**
   - The resistance force on sand is given as 73 Newtons.

3. **Comparing Resistances:**
   - Resistance on dirt (5 Newtons) is significantly less than the resistance on sand (73 Newtons).

4. **Conclusion on Travel Distance:**
   - Since the resistance is lower on dirt, the marble will encounter less opposing force and thus can maintain its speed longer, allowing it to travel further on dirt compared to sand.

Based on the above reasoning, the surface where the marble can travel the farthest is where the resistance force is the least, which is dirt.

If the pickup continues to travel in the departing direction and the van stops quickly,  
which vehicle will cover less distance?

### Options:
- **Option 1**: Pickup
- **Option 2**: Van

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Scenario**:
   - Both vehicles start at the same speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - The pickup continues to travel in the same direction.

   **Question:** The mammoth moved at a speed of 3 km per hour through the watering hole, but moved at a speed of 9 km per hour on firm ground. Why was firm ground?
   
   **Option 1:** Less resistant

   **Option 2:** More resistant

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:**

   - When an object or animal, like a mammoth in this scenario, moves through different terrains or mediums, the speed is influenced by the resistance it encounters. The resistance can be due to friction, drag, or other hindering forces.

   - **Watering Hole:** Typically, moving through water offers more resistance than moving on firm ground because water is denser and creates more drag and friction compared to air and solid surfaces. Thus, it slows down the movement of the mammoth, reducing its speed to 3 km per hour.

   - **Firm Ground:** In contrast, firm ground offers less resistance because it does not have the dense medium that water does. As a result, the mammoth encounters less friction compared to moving in water, allowing it to move faster, at 9 km per hour.

   - Therefore, the reason the mammoth moved faster on firm ground compared to the watering hole is because firm ground presented less resistance to its movement.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Given the explanation above, the firm ground is **less resistant** compared to the watering hole, enabling the mammoth to travel faster.

### Question:
The weight of an empty cement truck is approximately 8000 pounds. Later, 5 bags of cement, each weighing 5 kg, are placed on the truck. Does it travel more _____ without the cement bags?

### Options:
Option 1: Quickly
Option 2: Slowly

## Detailed Solution:

1. **Understanding the Weight Conversion**:
   - An empty cement truck weighs 8000 pounds.
   - Each cement bag weighs 5 kg. Therefore, 5 bags weigh \(5 \times 5 = 25\) kg.
   - We need to convert kilograms to pounds. The conversion factor is approximately \(1 \text{ kg} = 2.20462 \text{ pounds}\).

2. **Calculating the Additional Weight in Pounds**:
   - So, 25 kg equals \(25 \times 2.20462 = 55.1155\) pounds.
   - The total weight of the truck with the cement bags is \(8000 + 55.1155\) pounds.

3. **Comparing the Scenarios**:
   - Scenario 1: The truck without any cement bags weighs 8000 pounds.
   - Scenario 2: The truck with the cement bags weighs \(8000 + 55.1155 = 8055.1155\) pounds.

4. **Analyzing the Impact on Speed**:
   - When a vehicle, like the cement truck in this case, is heavier, it generally requires more force to accelerate and maintain speed due to increased inertia.
   - Therefore, the truck without the cement bags (weighing less) travels with less effort and can maintain speed more easily, making it travel more quickly.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The truck travels **more quickly** without the additional weight of the cement bags.

**Question:** Terry takes his bicycle for a ride, first traveling 7 meters through a grass field in 1 second, and then 12 meters on a paved road in 2 seconds. The paved road was?
**Option 1:** More resistant
**Option 2:** Less resistant

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Terry travels 7 meters on a grass field in 1 second.
   - Terry then travels 12 meters on a paved road in 2 seconds.

2. **Calculate the Speeds:**
   - **Speed on grass**: To determine the speed while traveling through the grass, we divide the distance by time:
     \[
     \text{Speed on grass} = \frac{7 \text{ meters}}{1 \text{ second}} = 7 \text{ m/s}
     \]
   - **Speed on paved road**: Similarly, calculate the speed on the paved road:
     \[
     \text{Speed on paved road} = \frac{12 \text{ meters}}{2 \text{ seconds}} = 6 \text{ m/s}
     \]

3. **Analyzing the Speeds:**
   - The speed on the grass is 7 m/s, while the speed on the paved road is 6 m/s.
   - Since the speed on the grass is greater than the speed on the paved road, this suggests that the paved road requires more effort to maintain speed, indicating higher resistance.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Typically, a paved road would offer less resistance than grass, allowing higher speeds; however, in this case, Terry's speed decreased on the paved road, implying that the paved road is presenting more resistance in this scenario.

5. **Conclude by choosing the correct option:**
   - Given the calculations and analysis, the paved road was providing more resistance because the speed decreased compared to the grass field.

**Question**: A train runs on city tracks at 120 km/h and on village tracks at 98 km/h. Does it mean the train gets hotter to run?

**Option 1**: City tracks

**Option 2**: Village tracks

## Solution and Explanation:

The question is essentially asking about the relationship between the speed of the train and the associated heat production, a common consideration in physics when dealing with motion and energy dissipation.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Relationship:**
   - When a vehicle such as a train moves, it encounters air resistance and friction. Both of these factors tend to increase with speed.
   - A higher speed usually implies greater frictional forces and air resistance that the train must overcome. These forces convert kinetic energy into thermal energy (heat).

2. **Speed and Heat Correlation:**
   - As the train travels faster, more energy is expended to overcome resistance and friction, which results in greater heat production.
   - Therefore, when the train operates at a higher speed, it generally gets ""hotter"".

3. **Application to Given Speeds:**
   - On city tracks, the train travels at 120 km/h.
   - On village tracks, the train travels at 98 km/h.
   - In terms of speed, 120 km/h > 98 km/h.

4. **Conclusion on Heat Production:**
   - Since the train runs faster on city tracks (120 km/h), it would generate more heat on city tracks than on village tracks.

Therefore, the train does indeed ""get hotter"" when it travels on the city tracks due to the higher speed.

**Question:**
If Sarah and Jenny both run at the same speed, Sarah runs for 78 minutes and Jenny runs for 27 more minutes than Sarah, who has traveled a greater distance?

**Option 1:** Sarah  
**Option 2:** Jenny

### Detailed Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Both Sarah and Jenny run at the same speed, meaning their distances directly depend on the time they spend running.
   - Sarah's running time = 78 minutes.
   - Jenny's running time = Sarah's running time + 27 minutes.

2. **Calculating Jenny's Running Time:**
   - Jenny's running time = 78 minutes (Sarah's running time) + 27 minutes = 105 minutes.

3. **Comparison of Running Times:**
   - Sarah runs for 78 minutes.
   - Jenny runs for 105 minutes.
   - Since Jenny runs for a longer period (105 minutes compared to Sarah’s 78 minutes) and both run at the same speed, Jenny will cover a greater distance.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time when speed is constant, Jenny has traveled a greater distance than Sarah.

Therefore, the correct option is **Option 2: Jenny**.

### Question:
Ranger and Rustler both rode horses that moved at the same speed. Rustler left at 02:00 while Ranger left at 01:00. Who traveled more?

### Options:
1. Ranger
2. Rustler

## Solution:

To determine who traveled more, we need to consider the time spent traveling by each individual, given that both horses move at the same speed.

- **Ranger's Travel Duration:**
  - Ranger starts traveling at 01:00.
  - Since no end time is given, we assume both are evaluated at the same point or need relative comparison based on comparable times.
  - Therefore, if both are evaluated at any specific time (for example, when evaluating their travels at a time such as 03:00), Ranger will have already started traveling an hour prior to Rustler.
  - So, from 01:00 to 02:00, Ranger travels for 1 hour more than Rustler.

- **Rustler's Travel Duration:**
  - Rustler starts traveling at 02:00.
  - Similar to Ranger, we assume they travel long enough for a comparison or both are evaluated at a mutual specific time. 

Since both horses have the same speed, the amount of distance covered directly depends on travel time. Ranger started an hour earlier and thus travels more in any evaluation within the same reference frame.

Even without loss of generality, the duration of time that passes matters directly, thus:
- **Ranger has traveled for more time** than Rustler by 1 hour, leading to more distance traveled.

Concluding based on the analysis of time advantage and identical speed:

### Question:
A little boy rolled two rubber balls down the hallway. The red ball stopped after 8 seconds. The blue one stopped after 9 seconds. Which one went further?

### Options:
- Option 1: Red ball
- Option 2: Blue ball

## Solution:

To determine which ball traveled a greater distance, we can apply the basic physics formula for distance traveled at constant speed, since there is no indication of acceleration. 

The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Assuming both balls are rolling at a constant speed, the ball that went for a longer duration will cover a greater distance, provided the initial conditions (such as the initial speed) are the same for both balls. 

In this scenario:
- The red ball rolls for 8 seconds.
- The blue ball rolls for 9 seconds.

We need to compare the distances:

- Distance traveled by the red ball:
  \[ D_{\text{red}} = v \times 8 \]

- Distance traveled by the blue ball:
  \[ D_{\text{blue}} = v \times 9 \]

Where \( v \) is the constant speed of the balls. Since the time for the blue ball is greater than the red ball's time, and assuming speed \( v \) is the same for both, the blue ball travels a greater distance.

Therefore, the blue ball, which moves for 9 seconds, travels further than the red ball, which moves for only 8 seconds.

### Question Translation:
If a skater rides at a speed of 23 m/s in a field and at a speed of 17 m/s in a skate park, what does this mean in terms of smoothness?

### Options Translation:
- Option 1: In the skate park
- Option 2: In the field

## Step 2: Reasoning and Solution

In general, the condition of the surface affects the speed at which a skater can ride. A smoother surface allows a skater to move faster because there is less friction and resistance which slows them down. Conversely, a rougher or less smooth surface would typically result in slower speeds due to higher friction.

### Analysis:

- **Field Speed (23 m/s):** The skater is able to ride at a faster speed in the field compared to the skate park. This could imply that the field provides less resistance due to a smoother surface.
  
- **Skate Park Speed (17 m/s):** The skater is slower in the skate park, which suggests that there is more resistance, possibly due to a rougher surface.

### Conclusion:

Given that the skater is able to ride faster in the field, it is likely that the field is smoother than the skate park. Thus, in terms of smoothness, the field is the more appropriate answer.

### Question:
A sled slid 22.9659 yards on a roof and 15 meters on cold ground, both starting at the same speed. Which surface is _____ rougher?

### Options:
- Option 1: Roof
- Option 2: Cold ground

## Solution

To determine which surface is rougher, we need to consider the physics of friction and how it affects the sled's movement. Given that the sled starts at the same speed on both surfaces, the distance it travels can be related to the friction present.

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Friction Force Impact:** 
   - A rougher surface will exert more frictional force on the sled, thus reducing the distance the sled can slide.
   - If the sled covers a shorter distance, it suggests that the frictional force is greater on that surface.

2. **Distance Conversion to Comparable Units:**
   - The roof distance is given as 22.9659 yards.
   - 1 yard = 0.9144 meters, so 22.9659 yards = 22.9659 * 0.9144 meters ≈ 21.0 meters.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Distance on the roof: approximately 21.0 meters.
   - Distance on cold ground: 15 meters.

The sled slides a shorter distance on the cold ground than on the roof. Therefore, the cold ground exerts more frictional force on the sled, indicating that the cold ground is the rougher surface.

## Conclusion
Based on the distances traveled by the sled and the concept of friction, the cold ground must be rougher because the sled travels a shorter distance on it compared to the roof.

**Question:** The mass of a bowling ball is 19 pounds, and the weight of a baseball is 6 pounds. Which one has a stronger gravitational force?

**Option 1:** Baseball  
**Option 2:** Bowling ball

### Solution:

1. **Understanding Gravitational Force:**
   The gravitational force exerted on an object is equivalent to its weight, which is the product of its mass and the gravitational acceleration (approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth). For objects on Earth, we can simplify this to say that the greater the mass of the object, the greater the gravitational force on it. 

2. **Mass vs. Weight:**
   In this context, the terms ""mass"" and ""weight"" are being used interchangeably for simplicity, given that both are indicative of gravitational attraction in practical terms on the Earth's surface. 

3. **Comparing the Bowling Ball and the Baseball:**
   - Bowling Ball: 19 pounds
   - Baseball: 6 pounds

4. **Concluding the Comparison:**
   Since the mass (or weight) of the bowling ball (19 pounds) is greater than that of the baseball (6 pounds), the bowling ball experiences a stronger gravitational force compared to the baseball. 

Thus, the object with the stronger gravitational force due to its greater weight is the bowling ball.

### Answer Conclusion:
The bowling ball has a stronger gravitational force when compared to the baseball because it has a greater mass (or weight).

**Question:**
Baba sent a package via USPS and a package via UPS. The package he sent through UPS arrived within 4 days, and the one sent through USPS arrived within 2 weeks. Which parcel service was slower?

**Option 1:** USPS was slower  
**Option 2:** UPS was slower

### Detailed Solution

To determine which parcel service was slower, we need to compare the delivery times of the packages sent through UPS and USPS.

1. **Time Calculation for UPS:**
   - The package sent via UPS took 4 days to arrive.

2. **Time Calculation for USPS:**
   - The package sent via USPS took 2 weeks to arrive.
   - To convert weeks into days for easier comparison: 
     - 1 week = 7 days
     - Therefore, 2 weeks = 2 × 7 = 14 days

3. **Comparison:**
   - UPS: 4 days
   - USPS: 14 days

The USPS took 14 days to deliver the package, while UPS took only 4 days. Thus, USPS took longer than UPS.

### Conclusion

Between the two services, USPS was slower because it took more days to deliver the package compared to UPS.

**Option 1:** The horse carriage will take more time to reach the next town.

**Option 2:** The racehorse will take more time to reach the next town.

### Solution:

To determine which entity will take more time to reach the next town, we need to compare their speeds. The entity with the lower speed will take more time to cover the same distance.

1. **Speed of the Horse Carriage:** 21 m/s
2. **Speed of the Racehorse:** 34 m/s

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

- **Understanding Speed and Time Relationship:** 
  - Time taken to reach a destination depends inversely on speed when the distance is constant. Thus, time taken is given by \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).

- **Comparing the Times:**
  - Since both start from the same point and travel the same distance to the next town, we only need to look at their speeds:
    - The horse carriage, with a speed of 21 m/s, will take more time than the racehorse, which has a speed of 34 m/s. This is because the racehorse is faster and thus covers the same distance in lesser time.

**Conclusion:**

The horse carriage, having a lower speed, will take longer to reach the next town compared to the racehorse. Therefore, the correct choice is:

**Problem:**  
Todd gets into his car on Monday and drives for 12 hours. He does the same on Tuesday but stops after 9 hours. On which day does he travel less distance?

**Option 1:** Monday  
**Option 2:** Tuesday

## Solution

To find out on which day Todd travels less, we need to compare the number of hours he drives on each day, assuming he drives at a constant speed on both days.

1. **Driving Time on Monday:**  
   - Todd drives for 12 hours.

2. **Driving Time on Tuesday:**  
   - Todd drives for 9 hours.

Since the driving speed is constant and the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time driven, we can conclude:

- The longer Todd drives, the more distance he covers.
- Conversely, the lesser time he drives, the less distance he covers.

Given that Todd drives for a longer duration on Monday (12 hours), it implies that he travels a greater distance on Monday compared to Tuesday where he only drives for 9 hours.

Therefore, the day on which Todd travels less distance is the day with the shorter driving time, which is Tuesday.

**Final Conclusion**
- Todd travels less distance on **Tuesday**.

**Question:** Beauty Queen walked across the marble floor at a speed of 15 meters/second but walked on the wooden floor at a speed of 1000 centimeters/second because it was?

**Option 1:** More resistant  
**Option 2:** Less resistant  

## Step-by-Step Solution 

1. **Convert Speeds for Uniformity:**  
   First, let's convert the speed on the wooden floor from centimeters per second to meters per second for easy comparison.  
   \[
   1000 \text{ cm/s} = \frac{1000}{100} \text{ m/s} = 10 \text{ m/s}
   \]

2. **Compare Speeds:**  
   - Speed on the marble floor = 15 meters/second  
   - Speed on the wooden floor = 10 meters/second  

   Beauty Queen walked at a slower speed on the wooden floor compared to the marble floor.

3. **Reasoning About Resistance:**  
   - If a surface is more resistant, it generally means that it offers greater friction, which can slow down movement across that surface.  
   - If a surface is less resistant, it offers less friction, and movement across it can be faster.

4. **Conclusion Based on Given Information:**  
   Since Beauty Queen walks more slowly on the wooden floor (10 m/s) compared to the marble floor (15 m/s), this implies the wooden floor is more resistant than the marble floor, hence offering more friction.

Based on this reasoning, Beauty Queen's slower speed on the wooden floor indicates the floor was **more resistant**.

**Question:**
A trainer observed his horse running every day. The horse was able to accelerate to a higher speed in 6 seconds when no one was riding it, and it took 12 seconds when someone was riding it. When was the horse's weight less?

**Option 1:** When it had a rider  
**Option 2:** When no one was riding it

## Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Scenario:**
   - We have a horse that can accelerate faster (in 6 seconds) when it is not carrying a rider.
   - With a rider, it takes more time (12 seconds) to reach the same speed.

2. **Comparing the Two Scenarios:**
   - **Without a Rider:** The horse accelerates in 6 seconds, indicating less resistance or force needed to accelerate, since no additional weight is present.
   - **With a Rider:** The horse takes 12 seconds to accelerate, indicating more resistance or force is needed because of the additional weight of the rider.

3. **Reasoning Based on Physics:**
   - From Newton’s second law, \( F = ma \) (where \( F \) is force, \( m \) is mass, and \( a \) is acceleration), we know that with the same force used by the horse, a smaller mass will result in a larger acceleration.
   - This means that for the same power output by the horse, it will accelerate faster without the additional mass of a rider.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The horse’s weight is effectively less when no one is riding it, as the absence of the rider’s weight allows it to accelerate faster.

Since both are competing to cross the same distance, the speed of each person is inversely proportional to the time taken. Thus, the person who takes more time is slower.

- Linda takes 4 milliseconds.
- Melinda takes 98 milliseconds.

Now, compare the two times:
- 4 milliseconds < 98 milliseconds

**Question:** Ted was riding his bike in the park. When he was on the cement path, he was able to zip around the park in 28 minutes, and on the grass, he took 17 minutes. Where will the bike get hotter?

**Option 1:** Cement path  
**Option 2:** Grass

## Solution:

To determine where the bike will get hotter, we need to consider which activity requires more effort, thus generating more heat. The heat generated by the bike primarily depends on the effort or power exerted by Ted while riding.

1. **Time to Cover Park:**
   - Cement Path: 28 minutes
   - Grass Path: 17 minutes

2. **Analysis:**
   - When Ted rides on the grass, he takes 17 minutes to complete the park circuit, which is less than the time taken on the cement path (28 minutes).
   - This implies that the same circuit is being covered in less time on the grass.
   - Generally, riding on grass is more resistant than riding on cement because grass provides more friction and does not allow smooth movement compared to cement.
   - Therefore, to cover the park on grass in less time, Ted must exert more effort or power, leading to more energy conversion into heat due to increased friction and resistance.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since riding on the grass requires more effort due to higher resistance, the bike is likely to get hotter when Ted is riding on the grass.

**Question:** Tina is training her two dogs for racing. The Greyhound weighs 60 pounds and the Rottweiler weighs 100 pounds. Which one can run faster?

**Option 1:** Rottweiler  
**Option 2:** Greyhound  

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Dog Breeds and Speed:**
   - Typically, the speed at which a dog can run is influenced by its breed and body composition, rather than just its weight.
   - Greyhounds are known for their exceptional speed and agility. They are one of the fastest dog breeds, capable of reaching speeds up to 45 miles per hour.
   - Rottweilers are generally stronger and heavier dogs, primarily bred for guarding and herding. They are not typically known for their high running speed compared to Greyhounds.

2. **Analyzing the Weight Factor:**
   - While the Rottweiler weighs more (100 pounds) than the Greyhound (60 pounds), weight is not the primary determinant of speed in dogs.
   - In fact, carrying more weight might reduce the running speed of the Rottweiler as compared to a lighter and more aerodynamic breed like the Greyhound.

3. **Conclusion from Dog Breed Characteristics:**
   - Given that Greyhounds are specifically bred for speed and have a physical structure that optimizes fast running, it is logical to conclude that the Greyhound will run faster than the Rottweiler.

Therefore, based on the known characteristics of these breeds, the Greyhound is likely to be the faster runner.

To determine which mode of transportation is slower, we need to compare the speeds in the same unit. We have two speeds given in different units: centimeters per second (cm/s) and meters per second (m/s).

1. **Convert the car's speed to meters per second to match the bicycle's unit:**

   The car speed is 39 cm/second. To convert this to meters per second:
   \[
   1 \text{ meter} = 100 \text{ centimeters}
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   39 \text{ cm/second} = \frac{39}{100} \text{ m/second} = 0.39 \text{ m/second}
   \]

2. **Comparison:**

   - Speed of the car: \(0.39 \text{ m/second}\)
   - Speed of the bicycle: \(2 \text{ m/second}\)

3. **Determine which is slower:**

   Since \(0.39 \text{ m/second}\) is less than \(2 \text{ m/second}\), the car is slower than the bicycle.

Therefore, the correct option, where the car is slower, is Option 2.

**Question:** A train conductor changes direction from a track to the ground by wheel and observes that he is traveling at a speed of 58 km/h, where he is traveling at a speed of 39 km/h with the same amount of energy. Which one was smoother?  
- **Option 1:** Track  
- **Option 2:** Wheel  

### Solution:

To determine which surface, the track or the ground using a wheel, is smoother, we analyze the context given in terms of traveling speeds using the same amount of energy.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The conductor travels at 58 km/h on one surface and 39 km/h on another, using the same energy input for both speeds.

2. **Energy and Speed Relationship:**
   - If two modes of travel (or surfaces) require the same energy input, the one that results in a higher speed indicates less resistance, because the energy is more effectively converted to kinetic energy, rather than being dissipated by friction or other resistive forces.
   - Therefore, the faster speed (58 km/h) suggests the conductor experienced less resistance or friction on that surface.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the conductor is traveling at 58 km/h on the *track*, it implies that the track is smoother compared to the ground (or wheel), as the same amount of energy allows for a higher speed on the track.
   
Thus, the track is smoother.

### Question:
A cricket can cover 15 meters per second and a chicken can cover 78 meters per second. If both travel the same distance, which one will arrive later?

### Options:
- Option 1: Chicken
- Option 2: Cricket

## Solution:

To determine which one arrives later, we need to compare the times taken by both the cricket and the chicken to cover a given distance. Since they both travel the same distance, let's denote this distance as ""D"" meters.

### Time Calculation:

**Cricket's Time:**
The time taken by the cricket to travel the distance ""D"" is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{cricket}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{cricket}}} = \frac{D}{15}
\]

**Chicken's Time:**
The time taken by the chicken to travel the distance ""D"" is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{chicken}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{chicken}}} = \frac{D}{78}
\]

### Comparison of Times:
We compare the two expressions for time to see which one is greater:

1. \(\frac{D}{15}\)

2. \(\frac{D}{78}\)

Since both expressions have D in the numerator, we can compare the denominators directly, assuming D is a positive value (as distance cannot be negative). The denominator 15 (for the cricket) is smaller than 78 (for the chicken), meaning \(\frac{D}{15}\) is greater than \(\frac{D}{78}\).

This shows that the cricket takes longer to complete the journey than the chicken.

Therefore, the cricket arrives later than the chicken.

**Conclusion:**

The cricket, which moves slower than the chicken, will arrive later. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Question in English:**
Kate is in a movie, and accidentally drops her cup on the floor. The cup rolls across a concrete floor for 4 seconds, covering a distance of 3 meters, but after hitting the carpeted floor, it takes 7 seconds to travel 2 meters. Was the cup faster on the concrete floor because the concrete floor had?

**Option 1:** More friction  
**Option 2:** Less friction

## Solution:

To solve the problem, we consider the factors affecting how fast the cup moves on different surfaces, namely friction.

1. **Understanding Friction:**
   - Friction is the force that resists the relative motion of solid surfaces.
   - Higher friction means more resistance, which generally results in slower motion.
   - Lower friction means less resistance, allowing for faster motion.

2. **Analyzing the Scenario:**
   - On the concrete floor: 
     - The cup covers a distance of 3 meters in 4 seconds.
     - We can calculate the speed: \(v_{\text{concrete}} = \frac{3 \, \text{m}}{4 \, \text{s}} = 0.75 \, \text{m/s}\).

   - On the carpeted floor:
     - The cup covers a distance of 2 meters in 7 seconds.
     - We can calculate the speed: \(v_{\text{carpet}} = \frac{2 \, \text{m}}{7 \, \text{s}} \approx 0.286 \, \text{m/s}\).

3. **Comparison and Reasoning:**
   - The speed on the concrete floor (0.75 m/s) is higher than on the carpeted floor (0.286 m/s).
   - This suggests that the concrete floor allows the cup to roll faster.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the cup moves faster on the concrete floor, it indicates that the concrete floor has **less friction** than the carpeted floor. Less friction allows the cup to roll with greater speed due to less resistance compared to the carpet.

Thus, the correct reason for the cup's faster speed on the concrete floor is **""less friction""**.

**Question**: Kate's boat propeller was spinning at 1300 revolutions per minute in the sea and at 130 revolutions per second in a river. Where does the propeller become less hot?
**Option 1**: Sea
**Option 2**: River

## Step-by-Step Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to determine where the boat propeller would generate less heat, which is typically associated with the lower speed of the propeller due to reduced friction and energy expenditure.

1. **Understanding the Units**:
   - In the sea, the propeller spins at 1300 revolutions per minute.
   - In the river, the propeller spins at 130 revolutions per second.

2. **Convert Revolutions per Second to Revolutions per Minute**:
   To compare directly, let's convert the second unit (revolutions per second) into revolutions per minute.
   - 1 revolution per second = 60 revolutions per minute.
   - Therefore, 130 revolutions per second = \(130 \times 60 = 7800\) revolutions per minute.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Sea: 1300 revolutions per minute
   - River: 7800 revolutions per minute

4. **Determine Where the Propeller Is Less Hot**:
   - Higher revolutions typically mean more friction and more heat generation.
   - In the sea: 1300 revolutions per minute is lower than in the river: 7800 revolutions per minute.

Since the propeller spins at a slower rate in the sea (1300 RPM) compared to the river (7800 RPM), it will generate less heat in the sea.

**Conclusion**:
The propeller becomes less hot when it is in the sea due to its slower rate of revolutions, which results in less friction and heat generation.

**Question:**  
Kevin took a plane from New York to Chicago at 08:00 and Easter took a plane from New York to Los Angeles at 07:00. They are both traveling on the same type of aircraft, so their travel speeds are the same. Both of them arrived at their destinations at the same time. Who traveled for a longer time?

**Option 1:** Kevin  
**Option 2:** Easter  

---

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to determine which flight duration was longer based on the given departure times and the fact that they arrived at their destinations simultaneously. 

1. **Convert Time Zones (if applicable):** 
   - **New York (NY) to Chicago:** Both New York and Chicago are in different time zones. New York operates on Eastern Time (ET), while Chicago operates on Central Time (CT). Central Time is 1 hour behind Eastern Time.
   - **New York (NY) to Los Angeles:** New York operates on Eastern Time, while Los Angeles operates on Pacific Time (PT), which is 3 hours behind Eastern Time.

2. **Analyze Kevin's Trip:**  
   - **Departure:** 08:00 ET from New York
   - **Arrival** in Chicago: Since the arrival time is not directly given, let's assume both journeys take the same amount of time due to their same speed, and the problem states they arrived at their destinations simultaneously.
   - **Time Zone Adjustment for Kevin:** Chicago is 1 hour behind New York, so if it takes Kevin `x` hours, the arrival in Chicago at his local time remains unchanged since we are considering both arrive simultaneously.

3. **Analyze Easter's Trip:**  
   - **Departure:** 07:00 ET from New York
   - **Arrival** in Los Angeles: As they arrive at the same time, the calculation for the duration needs acknowledgment of the time zone shifts but the duration is simply based on departure since time adjustment won't change the fact.
   - **Time Zone Adjustment for Easter:** Los Angeles is 3 hours behind New York. 

4. **Determine who traveled longer:**  
   - Kevin departed at 08:00 from New York.
   - Easter departed at 07:00 from New York. 

Since both arrive at the same time at their respective destinations and both planes travel at the same speed:

- Easter left earlier than Kevin by one hour (07:00 compared to 08:00), meaning Easter was in"

**Question:** Mohit bought 6 bananas from a shop for 20 taka. However, Raju bought 2 dozen bananas from another shop for 72 taka. Who spent more money on buying bananas?

**Option 1:** Raju  
**Option 2:** Mohit

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per banana for both Mohit and Raju, and then compare the costs.

### Step 1: Calculate Mohit's cost per banana

Mohit bought 6 bananas for 20 taka.

- **Cost per banana for Mohit = Total cost / Number of bananas**
- Cost per banana = \( \frac{20}{6} \) taka
- Simplifying, \( \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \) taka per banana

### Step 2: Calculate Raju's cost per banana

Raju bought 2 dozen bananas for 72 taka. 

Note that 1 dozen equals 12, so 2 dozen bananas are:

- \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) bananas

- **Cost per banana for Raju = Total cost / Number of bananas**
- Cost per banana = \( \frac{72}{24} \) taka
- Simplifying, \( \frac{72}{24} = 3 \) taka per banana

### Step 3: Compare the costs

- Mohit pays approximately 3.33 taka per banana.
- Raju pays 3 taka per banana.

Since 3.33 taka (Mohit's cost per banana) is more than 3 taka (Raju's cost per banana), Mohit spent more money per banana.

Therefore, Mohit spent more on buying bananas than Raju.

**Question:**

A race car and a pickup truck were both traveling at the same speed on the highway. The race car driver, feeling tired, parked after 5 minutes, while the pickup truck driver continued driving for 10 minutes. Which vehicle ultimately covered a greater distance?

**Option 1**: Race car  
**Option 2**: Pickup truck

## Solution

To solve this problem, let's analyze the scenario given the conditions in the question:

1. Both vehicles, the race car and the pickup truck, are traveling at the same constant speed. Let's denote this speed as \( v \).

2. **Race Car:**
   - The race car travels for 5 minutes.
   - Thus, the distance covered by the race car is:
     \[
     \text{Distance of race car} = v \times 5 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

3. **Pickup Truck:**
   - The pickup truck travels for 10 minutes.
   - The distance covered by the pickup truck is:
     \[
     \text{Distance of pickup truck} = v \times 10 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

Since the pickup truck continues for a longer time (10 minutes compared to 5 minutes for the race car) at the same speed, it is clear that:

\[
\text{Distance of pickup truck} = v \times 10 > v \times 5 = \text{Distance of race car}
\]

From the above calculations, it's evident that the pickup truck covered a greater distance than the race car.

Therefore, the correct option is **Option 2: Pickup truck**.

Question: Joe is returning to the city at night. If Joe is 14 km away and comes closer to 2.5 km from the city, the city lights will seem more _____ to him.

Option 1: Dim
Option 2: Bright

## Solution

To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Positioning and Distance**: 
   - Joe initially observes the city lights from 14 km away. At this distance, the city lights appear with a certain brightness level.
   
2. **Change in Distance**:
   - Joe moves closer to the city and is now at a distance of 2.5 km from the city. This means he has significantly reduced the distance from the original 14 km to just 2.5 km.

3. **Perception of Brightness**:
   - The brightness of a light source, as perceived by an observer, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. This principle is known as the inverse square law. According to this law, as the distance between the observer and the light source decreases, the intensity or brightness of the light appears to increase.

4. **Application to the Scenario**:
   - Since Joe moved from 14 km to 2.5 km closer to the city, the distance from the light source (city lights) has decreased considerably.
   - Therefore, based on the inverse square law, the city lights will appear **brighter** to Joe when he is 2.5 km away compared to when he was 14 km away.

Conclusively, as Joe approaches the city and minimizes his distance to 2.5 km, the city lights will appear brighter than from their initial farther distance.

### Question:
From a distance of 100 feet from my house, as the police siren moves to a distance of 175 feet away from my house, how does the sound of the siren change?

### Options:
- Option 1: Increased
- Option 2: Decreased

## Detailed Solution

The problem involves understanding how sound intensity changes with distance. The sound intensity, which can be perceived as volume or loudness, typically decreases as the distance from the sound source increases. This is due to the inverse square law, which states that the intensity of sound is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Mathematically, this is represented as:

\[ I \propto \frac{1}{d^2} \]

Where \( I \) is the intensity and \( d \) is the distance from the sound source.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The siren is at a distance of 100 feet from the house.
   - According to the inverse square law, the intensity (or loudness) at this point is inversely proportional to \( 100^2 \).

2. **Final Condition:**
   - The siren moves to a distance of 175 feet from the house.
   - The intensity now is inversely proportional to \( 175^2 \).

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Intensity at 100 feet: \( \frac{1}{100^2} \)
   - Intensity at 175 feet: \( \frac{1}{175^2} \)

Since the distance increases from 100 feet to 175 feet, the intensity at 175 feet will be less than the intensity at 100 feet because:

\[ \frac{1}{175^2} < \frac{1}{100^2} \]

This clearly shows that as the siren moves further away from the house, the perceived loudness decreases.

## Conclusion

Based on the laws of physics and the analysis above, as the siren moves from 100 feet to 175 feet away from the house, the sound of the siren decreases in intensity.

   **Option 1:** Bright  
   **Option 2:** Dim

2. **Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

   Initially, Bob is 290 cm away from the streetlight. After moving, he is 15 meters away.

   Let's translate these measurements into the same units for easier comparison. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, Bob's initial distance from the streetlight is 290 cm, which is 2.9 meters.

   - **Initial Distance:** 2.9 meters (or 290 cm)
   - **Final Distance:** 15 meters (or 1500 cm)

   The question involves understanding how the perceived brightness of the light changes as Bob moves further away.

   Generally, the brightness of a light source perceived by an observer reduces as the distance from the light source increases. In physics, this relationship is often described by the inverse square law, which states that the intensity (or brightness) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Thus, if the distance increases, the brightness decreases.

   Here, Bob has moved from being 2.9 meters away to 15 meters away. This is a significant increase in distance, which means the light will appear dimmer due to the greater distance.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Since the distance from the light has increased significantly from 2.9 meters to 15 meters, Bob would observe the streetlight as appearing dimmer.

### Options:
Option 1: Less resistant  
Option 2: More resistant  

## Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between speed and resistance. Generally, an object will travel faster through a medium that offers less resistance and slower through a medium that offers more resistance.

1. **Analyzing the Speeds:**
   - Through the water hole, the mammoth traveled at 18 km/h.
   - On firm dirt, the mammoth traveled at 27 km/h.

2. **Understanding Resistance:**
   - Water typically provides significant resistance to movement due to its density and the need to push against water molecules.
   - Firm dirt, being a solid surface, offers less resistance compared to water, allowing objects to move faster.

3. **Logical Reasoning:**
   - The mammoth's speed increased when moving from a water hole to firm dirt, from 18 km/h to 27 km/h.
   - This increase in speed suggests that firm dirt offers **less resistance** compared to the water hole.

Based on this reasoning, since the mammoth traveled faster on the firm dirt, the lower resistance of the firm dirt compared to the water is the reason for its increased speed.

## Conclusion:

After analyzing the situation with respect to resistance and speed, we can deduce that the mammoth moved faster on firm dirt because the firm dirt offered less resistance.

**English Translation of the Question:**
A marble rolling on dirt creates a resistance of 5 Newtons, whereas on sand, it creates a resistance of 17 Newtons. Where will the marble be able to travel further?

**Options:**
- Option 1: Sand
- Option 2: Dirt

## Step-by-Step Solution

To determine where the marble will travel further, we need to consider the resistance forces acting on it. The fundamental principle here is that lower resistance allows for longer travel distance if all other factors (like initial speed, angle, etc.) are the same.

### Analyzing the Resistances:
1. **Resistance on Dirt:** 5 Newtons
2. **Resistance on Sand:** 17 Newtons

The marble experiences less resistance on dirt compared to sand. This means that more of the marble's initial kinetic energy is maintained over a longer distance on dirt than on sand, where higher resistance would lead to quicker deceleration.

### Conclusion:
Because 5 Newtons is less than 17 Newtons, the marble faces less force reducing its motion on dirt than it does on sand. Thus, it will be able to keep rolling and, hence, travel further on dirt.

**Question**: Doug goes from his home to his friend's house on his bicycle and he can travel 7 meters in one hour, and when he makes the same trip on foot, he covers 2 miles in one hour. How does Doug get to his friend's house faster?

**Option 1**: On foot

**Option 2**: By bicycle

## Solution:

To determine the faster method of travel for Doug to his friend's house, we need to compare the speed of both methods: by bicycle and on foot. 

1. **Convert units for comparison:**

   - **Bicycle:** Doug travels at a speed of 7 meters per hour.

   - **On Foot:** Doug travels at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   
     We need to convert the speed on foot from miles per hour to meters per hour to make a direct comparison with the bicycle speed.
   
     - 1 mile = 1609.34 meters.
     - Therefore, 2 miles = 2 * 1609.34 meters = 3218.68 meters.
     - Hence, Doug's walking speed is 3218.68 meters per hour.

2. **Compare the speeds:**

   - **Bicycling speed:** 7 meters per hour.
   - **Walking speed:** 3218.68 meters per hour.

3. **Comparison Analysis:**

   From the above calculations, it is clear that Doug covers significantly more distance when walking (3218.68 meters per hour) compared to bicycling (7 meters per hour). Therefore, Doug will reach his friend's house faster when he travels on foot.

## Conclusion:

Doug will reach his friend's house faster by walking as his speed on foot is much higher than on the bicycle.

- \( F \) is the gravitational force between the objects,
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects,
- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two objects.

For the gravitational field that a single mass \( m \) exerts, we can simplify as we compare how mass \( m \) affects its surroundings. The strength of a gravitational field at a distance \( r \) from the mass is given by:

\[
g = \frac{G \cdot m}{r^2}
\]

where \( m \) represents the mass creating the field.

### Application to the Billiard Ball and Basketball

1. **Billiard Ball:**
   - Mass \( m_1 = 6 \) ounces.

2. **Basketball:**
   - Mass \( m_2 = 0.5 \) ounces.

Since gravitational field strength is directly proportional to the mass of the object, the greater the mass of the object, the stronger the gravitational field it can produce in its vicinity.

### Conclusion

Since the billiard ball (6 ounces) has a greater mass than the basketball (0.5 ounces), it will have a stronger gravitational field.

Therefore, the correct choice is the billiard ball.

### Question:
The diameter of a strand of hair is 0.06 mm, whereas the diameter of a rope is 11 mm. Therefore, hair is?

### Options:
- Option 1: Stronger
- Option 2: Weaker

## Solution

To determine whether hair is ""stronger"" or ""weaker"" compared to a rope, we need to consider both the material properties and the diameter of each.

1. **Understanding Diameter and Strength**:
   - A smaller diameter usually indicates that the individual strand is less able to withstand large forces compared to something with a larger diameter.
   - In this problem, the diameter of the hair is much smaller than that of the rope. Specifically, 0.06 mm is significantly less than 11 mm.

2. **Material Properties**:
   - While certain materials might be inherently strong or weak regardless of size (e.g., steel versus cotton), in the absence of information regarding the materials, diameter serves as a general proxy for ""strength"" in this context.
   
3. **Comparison**:
   - Given the data, a strand of hair with a diameter of 0.06 mm inherently cannot handle as much stress or load as a rope with a diameter of 11 mm, assuming all other factors like materials and construction remain constant or are typical (e.g., human hair vs. nylon rope).
   
4. **Conclusion**:
   - Hair, given its much smaller diameter compared to the rope, would be considered ""weaker"" under typical understanding of the term in this context.

Thus, based on the size comparison and usual assumptions regarding the strength capacities of hair versus rope, the correct choice is that hair is weaker.

**Question:** Rod was rolling a ball towards his dog. He was able to roll the ball 12 meters on cement and 10 meters on grass. Why is it that the cement allows for this difference?

**Option 1:** Rough  
**Option 2:** Smooth

### Solution

To solve the problem, let's analyze the situation described:

- Rod rolls a ball on two different surfaces: cement and grass.
- The ball rolls **12 meters** on cement and **10 meters** on grass.

The key to answering the question lies in understanding the properties of the surfaces and how they affect the ball's rolling distance:

1. **Cement:**
   - Cement is typically a hard, flat surface.
   - It is generally **smooth** compared to grassy terrain.
   - A smooth surface has less friction. With less friction, the ball can roll further before coming to a stop.

2. **Grass:**
   - Grass usually has an uneven and softer surface.
   - It provides more resistance, hence more friction, causing the ball to stop sooner compared to a hard surface.

Given these observations, the ball can roll further on cement primarily because the cement surface is smooth compared to grass, resulting in less friction and a longer rolling distance.

### Conclusion

The reason the ball rolls further on the cement is because the cement is **smooth**. Therefore, the correct option that describes why the cement allows for the greater rolling distance is:

### Question:
A cowboy and a hippie were both walking in San Francisco, and since they were of the same height, they walked at the same speed. However, the cowboy started walking at 5 am, while the hippie started at 1 pm. Now it is 7 pm. So?

### Options:
- Option 1: The cowboy has traveled less distance.
- Option 2: The hippie has traveled less distance.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the Starting Times:**
   - The cowboy started walking at 5 am.
   - The hippie started walking at 1 pm.

2. **Determine the Current Time:**
   - It is currently 7 pm.

3. **Calculate the Duration Each Person Has Walked:**
   - **Cowboy:** From 5 am to 7 pm.
     - Duration = 7 pm - 5 am
     - Convert all to 24-hour format: 7 pm = 19:00, 5 am = 5:00
     - Time walked by cowboy = 19:00 - 5:00 = 14 hours

   - **Hippie:** From 1 pm to 7 pm.
     - Duration = 7 pm - 1 pm
     - Convert to 24-hour format: 1 pm = 13:00
     - Time walked by hippie = 19:00 - 13:00 = 6 hours

4. **Analyze the Distance Travelled:**
   - Both individuals walk at the same speed.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Therefore, the distance is proportional to the time walked.
   - Cowboy's walking time is 14 hours.
   - Hippie's walking time is 6 hours.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The cowboy has walked for a longer duration (14 hours) compared to the hippie (6 hours).
   - Therefore, the cowboy has traveled more distance as time is directly proportional to distance when speed is constant.

6. **Select the Correct Option:**
   - Since the cowboy has traveled more distance, the hippie has traveled less.

Therefore, the correct answer is **""Option 2: The hippie has traveled less distance.""**

### Question:
A race car and a pickup truck were both traveling at the same speed on the highway. The driver of the race car became tired and parked after 29 minutes, while the pickup truck driver drove for 43 minutes. Which vehicle ultimately traveled a greater distance?

### Options:
- Option 1: Race Car
- Option 2: Pickup

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Both vehicles—race car and pickup truck—are traveling at the same speed.
   - We need to compare the distances both vehicles covered.

2. **Given:**
   - Race car travels for 29 minutes.
   - Pickup truck travels for 43 minutes.
   - Both vehicles have the same speed, denoted by \( v \).

3. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - The formula for distance is: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - **Distance covered by the race car:**
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{race car}} = v \times 29 
     \]
   - **Distance covered by the pickup truck:**
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{pickup}} = v \times 43
     \]

4. **Comparing Distances:**
   - Since the speed \( v \) is the same for both vehicles, the comparison of distances can be reduced to comparing the time factors:
     \[
     29 \quad \text{vs.} \quad 43
     \]
   - Clearly, \( 43 > 29 \), meaning the distance covered by the pickup truck is greater.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The pickup truck travels a greater distance because it has driven for a longer duration at the same speed compared to the race car.

### Question:
Mary's skiff is capable of traveling a distance of 10 miles in the bay before running out of fuel compared to 4 miles in the open sea. This means that which is rougher?

### Options:
- Option 1: The bay
- Option 2: The open sea

## Solution

To determine which environment (the bay or the open sea) is rougher, we need to consider the distance Mary's skiff can travel before running out of fuel. Let's analyze the given data:

- In the bay, Mary's skiff can travel **10 miles** before running out of fuel.
- In the open sea, it can travel only **4 miles**.

### Explanation:

1. **Distance Traveled and Environment Condition:**
   - The distance a vessel can cover before running out of fuel is directly related to the conditions it encounters. Rougher conditions generally lead to increased resistance, requiring more energy (or fuel) to cover the same distance.
   - Therefore, if the skiff can cover a longer distance in the bay than in the open sea, this implies that the conditions in the bay are more favorable (or less rough) compared to the open sea.

2. **Roughness Assessment:**
   - Given that the skiff covers 10 miles in the bay and only 4 miles in the open sea, the open sea presents more resistance, which suggests that it is rougher than the bay.

Hence, based on the analysis above, we conclude that the open sea is rougher.

## Conclusion
The correct interpretation of the distances covered indicates that the open sea is rougher than the bay.

**Question:** Two horses are leaving the same stable. The white horse is traveling at the same speed as the gray horse. The gray horse traveled for 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the white horse traveled for 3 hours and 48 minutes. Which horse traveled a greater distance?

**Option 1:** White horse  
**Option 2:** Gray horse

## Solution:

To determine which horse traveled a greater distance, we need to compare the time each horse traveled, given that both traveled at the same speed.

The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since both horses are traveling at the same speed, the distance traveled is only dependent on the time traveled. Therefore, we need to compare the travel times:

1. **Gray Horse Travel Time:**
   - 1 hour and 30 minutes
   - Convert this time into hours: 
     \[ 1 \text{ hour} + \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

2. **White Horse Travel Time:**
   - 3 hours and 48 minutes
   - Convert this time into hours:
     \[ 3 \text{ hours} + \frac{48 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 3 + 0.8 = 3.8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we compare the two times:
- Gray horse: \(1.5 \text{ hours}\)
- White horse: \(3.8 \text{ hours}\)

Since 3.8 hours is greater than 1.5 hours, the white horse traveled for a longer duration.

Thus, the white horse traveled a greater distance.

**Question:** John is standing on ice that is 10 inches thick and ice that is 1 inch thick. Which type of ice is least likely to break?

**Option 1:** 10 inches thick ice  
**Option 2:** 1 inch thick ice  

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to understand which thickness of ice would be more prone to breaking under John's weight.

1. **Understanding Ice Strength:**
   - The strength of ice, and its capacity to support weight, depends largely on its thickness. Generally, the thicker the ice, the more weight it can support due to the increased structural integrity.

2. **Comparing Thickness:**
   - **10 inches thick ice:** This is a considerable amount of thickness for ice, generally capable of supporting significant weight without breaking. This thickness would typically be found in colder environments or during winter where ice forms over lakes and rivers.
   - **1 inch thick ice:** This is relatively thin ice, and thin ice is known to be fragile and much more susceptible to breaking under the weight of a human.

3. **Probability of Breaking:**
   - Thicker ice (10 inches) has a greater capacity to withstand weight and pressure, making it less likely to break when someone is standing on it.
   - Thinner ice (1 inch) is far weaker in comparison and is very prone to cracking or breaking when subjected to the weight of a person.

Therefore, based on the reasoning above, the ice that is least likely to break is the one that is thicker.

**Conclusion:** Thicker ice is structurally more sound and less prone to breaking compared to thinner ice.

**Option 1:** Water mixed with sulfuric acid  
**Option 2:** Water mixed with sodium chloride

## Detailed Solution:

1. **Understanding the Compounds:**

   - **Sodium Chloride (NaCl):** Commonly known as table salt, when mixed with water it creates a saline solution. Sodium chloride is safe for human consumption and is regularly consumed in daily meals.

   - **Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄):** A highly corrosive strong acid that is dangerous to consume. Sulfuric acid can cause severe chemical burns and ingestion can lead to serious internal damage and poisoning.

2. **Solution Analysis:**

   - When determining the safety of consuming a water mixture, we need to consider the nature and properties of the substances mixed with the water.
   
   - **Water mixed with Sodium Chloride:** This is essentially saltwater and is not harmful in moderate quantities. It's important to note that consuming large amounts of saltwater can lead to dehydration, but it is fundamentally safe compared to the alternative.

   - **Water mixed with Sulfuric Acid:** Even in diluted forms, sulfuric acid is highly dangerous to consume due to its strong acidic nature. It can cause severe damage to internal organs, potentially leading to fatal consequences.

3. **Conclusion:**

   - Based on the properties and safety of the substances, sodium chloride mixed with water is safe to drink in sensible quantities.
  
   - Sulfuric acid mixed with water is highly unsafe and should never be consumed.

By analyzing the properties and safety of the mixed solutions, we can conclude:

   Question: While rolling through weeds, Mary's wagon heats up to 37 degrees Celsius, and while rolling through gravel, it heats up to 111.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Does this mean her wagon is forced to slow down?
   
   Option 1: Weeds
   
   Option 2: Gravel

2. **Detailed Solution:**

   To determine which condition forces Mary's wagon to slow down, we need to compare the temperatures when the wagon is rolling through weeds versus gravel. A higher temperature implies more friction and energy loss, which could lead to a reduction in speed.

   - First, convert both temperatures to the same unit to facilitate comparison. Converting 111.3 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius:

     \[
     \text{Celsius} = \frac{5}{9} \times (\text{Fahrenheit} - 32)
     \]

     \[
     \text{Celsius} = \frac{5}{9} \times (111.3 - 32)
     \]

     \[
     \text{Celsius} = \frac{5}{9} \times 79.3
     \]

     \[
     \text{Celsius} = \frac{5 \times 79.3}{9}
     \]

     \[
     \text{Celsius} ≈ 44.06 \text{ degrees Celsius}
     \]

   - Comparing the two temperatures:
     - Through weeds: 37 degrees Celsius
     - Through gravel: approximately 44.06 degrees Celsius

   The wagon reaches a higher temperature when going through gravel (approximately 44.06°C) compared to when rolling through weeds (37°C). Higher temperatures typically indicate more friction, suggesting that the wagon would slow down due to increased resistance when passing through gravel.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Since the wagon is at a higher temperature (and likely experiencing greater friction) while moving through gravel, it is more likely to slow down under that condition.

### Options:
- Option 1: Slow moving
- Option 2: Fast moving

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine whether the F-16 is considered ""slow moving"" or ""fast moving,"" we should consider the context of the given weights and what they imply about the aircraft's capabilities.

1. **Convert the Weight of a Jumbo Jet to Pounds**: 
   - 1 kilogram is approximately 2.20462 pounds.
   - So, the weight of the jumbo jet in pounds is \( 439,987 \times 2.20462 \approx 969,999 \) pounds.

2. **Comparison of Weights**:
   - **F-16 weight**: 34,786 pounds
   - **Jumbo Jet weight**: 969,999 pounds

3. **Implication of Weight on Speed**:
   - Generally, smaller, lighter aircraft like the F-16 are built for agility and speed, as opposed to large, heavier aircraft like a jumbo jet which are designed to carry more weight efficiently over long distances at a stable, albeit slower, speed.
   - The lighter weight of the F-16 allows it to be more maneuverable and capable of faster speeds compared to the much heavier jumbo jet.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - Given the significant difference in weights, it's reasonable to conclude that the lighter and more agile F-16 is considered ""fast moving"" in comparison to a jumbo jet.

## Conclusion:
The F-16, being much lighter and typically faster, is characterized as fast moving.

**Question:**
The mass of a golf ball is 78 grams and the mass of a baseball is 0.159 kilograms. Which one has a comparatively weaker gravitational field?

**Options:**
- **Option 1:** Golf Ball
- **Option 2:** Baseball

## Solution:

To determine which object has a comparatively weaker gravitational field, we need to consider the gravitational force each object exerts based on its mass.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Gravitational Field:**
   - The gravitational field (or gravitational strength) exerted by an object is directly proportional to its mass. In simple terms, the greater the mass, the stronger the gravitational field it generates. However, because we are comparing two small objects, we also assume they are in Earth’s gravitational field and focus on their respective masses.

2. **Mass Conversion:**
   - The mass of the golf ball is given as 78 grams.
     - Conversion to kilograms: \( 78 \text{ grams} = 0.078 \text{ kilograms} \).
   - The mass of the baseball is given as 0.159 kilograms.

3. **Comparison of Masses:**
   - Golf Ball: 0.078 kilograms
   - Baseball: 0.159 kilograms
   - Clearly, the mass of the baseball is greater than the mass of the golf ball.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the gravitational field strength an object can exert is directly related to its mass, the golf ball, having lesser mass, will have a comparatively weaker gravitational field than the baseball.

Thus, the object with the comparatively weaker gravitational field is the golf ball.

**Option 1:** More distance  
**Option 2:** Less distance

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the problem:**

   We need to determine whether the bike travels more distance or less distance compared to the train, given their respective speeds.

2. **Given Information:**

   - Speed of the train = 0.4 km per hour
   - Speed of the bike = 0.12 km per hour

3. **Analyzing the speeds:**

   In this scenario, distance covered is directly proportional to the speed when the time duration for both the modes of transportation is the same.

   - The speed of the train is 0.4 km per hour.
   - The speed of the bike is 0.12 km per hour.

4. **Comparing the speeds:**

   By comparing the speeds:
   - 0.4 km per hour (train) is greater than 0.12 km per hour (bike).

   This implies that in the same amount of time, the train will cover more distance than the bike because its speed is higher.

5. **Conclusion:**

### Question:
Two planes take off from the same airfield and fly at the same speed once they reach their altitude. The red plane flies for 42 minutes and lands in a nearby city, while the green plane flies for an additional 19 minutes and lands in a further city. What does this mean?

### Options:
1. The red plane flew a greater distance.
2. The green plane flew a greater distance.

## Solution

To determine which plane flew a greater distance, we need to consider the relationship between speed, time, and distance. The formula for calculating distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since both planes fly at the same speed, the distance each plane travels is directly proportional to the time they spend flying. 

- The red plane flies for 42 minutes.
- The green plane flies for an additional 19 minutes compared to the red plane, making its total flying time \( 42 + 19 = 61 \) minutes.

### Comparing the Distances:

1. **Distance traveled by the red plane:**

   \[ \text{Distance}_\text{red} = \text{Speed} \times 42 \]

2. **Distance traveled by the green plane:**

   \[ \text{Distance}_\text{green} = \text{Speed} \times 61 \]

Since the speed of both planes is the same, we can compare the distances just by comparing the times:

- Clearly, 61 minutes (green plane) is greater than 42 minutes (red plane).

Thus, the green plane flies for a longer time and therefore covers a greater distance compared to the red plane.

**Conclusion: The green plane flew a greater distance.**

### Question:
The fastest terrestrial animal on Earth, the cheetah, is racing against a rabbit in a 100-meter race. Who will win this race?

### Options:
- Option 1: Cheetah
- Option 2: Rabbit

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to consider the speed capabilities of both animals involved in the race.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Cheetah's Speed:**
   - Cheetahs are widely recognized as the fastest land animals. They can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (about 97 kilometers per hour) within a few seconds. Over short distances, such as 100 meters, a cheetah can maintain high speeds, typically completing such a distance in about 5 to 6 seconds.

2. **Understanding Rabbit's Speed:**
   - Rabbits, while quite agile and fast relative to many other animals, do not possess the speed capability of a cheetah. An average rabbit might reach speeds of around 35 to 45 kilometers per hour, which is approximately 22 to 28 miles per hour.

3. **Comparing the Two Competitors:**
   - Given that the cheetah's top speed is nearly double or more that of a rabbit's, it is quite evident that in a direct race over a short 100-meter sprint, the cheetah has a significant advantage in terms of speed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The problem requires us to identify the winner in a 100-meter sprint between a cheetah and a rabbit. Given their respective speeds, the cheetah would complete the race much faster than the rabbit.

Thus, the winner of the 100-meter race would unquestionably be the cheetah.

**Question:** While rolling through weeds, Mary's wagon reaches a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, and while rolling through gravel, it reaches a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. Does this mean her wagon is forced to roll at a slower speed?
**Option 1:** Weeds
**Option 2:** Gravel

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Temperature and Rolling Resistance:**
   - When Mary's wagon rolls through different surfaces, the temperature it reaches can be influenced by the resistance of the surface. Higher resistance generally means more friction, causing the vehicle to slow down and more heat to be generated.

2. **Analyzing the Given Conditions:**
   - When the wagon rolls through weeds, it reaches a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius.
   - When it rolls through gravel, it reaches a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius.

3. **Interpreting the Temperature Differences:**
   - The higher temperature observed when rolling through gravel suggests that there is more friction, and therefore more resistance, on this surface compared to when it rolls through weeds.
   - More resistance means that the wagon is likely exerting more energy to move forward, which usually results in slower movement, as a significant portion of energy is converted to heat due to friction.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the wagon reaches a higher temperature of 50 degrees Celsius on gravel, it indicates that there is greater friction and resistance compared to weeds, where it only reaches 40 degrees Celsius. Thus, the wagon is likely rolling at a slower speed through the gravel because of the higher resistance and resultant heat.

**Question:** A volleyball player jumped 1.2 meters on the gym floor but jumped 8 cm higher on the sand at the sea shore. Why was that?

**Option 1:** More resistance

**Option 2:** Less resistance

## Detailed Solution:

When analyzing the jumping performance of a volleyball player on different surfaces, a key factor to consider is the resistance (or traction) each surface provides. Let's break this down:

1. **Jump on the Gym Floor:**
   - Gym floors are typically hard surfaces. They are designed to provide good traction and a stable environment for athletic activities.
   - The player managed to jump 1.2 meters here.

2. **Jump on the Sand at the Sea Shore:**
   - Sand, compared to a gym floor, is a much softer surface. It is less stable underfoot and tends to absorb more energy when an athlete tries to push off of it (like during a jump).

3. **Comparison and Reasoning:**
   - Despite sand being a softer, yielding surface, the player jumped higher by 8 cm compared to the gym floor.
   - This increased jump height indicates that the surface provided a condition that resulted in **less resistance.** The yielding nature of sand allows for a more explosive action due to the pushing effect of the soft surface, potentially propelling the athlete higher if leveraged correctly.
   - The fact that the player could jump higher implies that the resistance directly affecting the jump was less, allowing for a greater push-off force to be applied vertically.

Hence, based on the conditions and the jump height attained on both surfaces, the reason the player jumped higher on the sand is best explained by the surface providing **less resistance** during the jump take-off phase.

## Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the correct option describing the increased jump height on the sand is:

### Question:
A racehorse and a horse-drawn carriage both leave the saloon at the same time. The horse-drawn carriage can travel 8 meters, and the racehorse can travel 19 meters in the same amount of time. Which one will reach the next town first?

### Options:
- **Option 1:** The horse-drawn carriage will take more time to reach the next town.
- **Option 2:** The racehorse will take more time to reach the next town.

## Detailed Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two objects: a racehorse and a horse-drawn carriage.
   - In the same amount of time, the horse-drawn carriage covers a distance of 8 meters, while the racehorse covers a distance of 19 meters.

2. **Comparing Speeds:**
   - Speed is defined as distance traveled per unit of time.
   - Let’s assume that both travel for the same period of time, \( t \).
   - The distance traveled by the horse-drawn carriage in time \( t \) is \( 8t \) meters.
   - The distance traveled by the racehorse in time \( t \) is \( 19t \) meters.

3. **Conclusion from Speed:**
   - Clearly, \( 19t > 8t \) for any positive value of \( t \).
   - This inequality shows that the racehorse covers more distance than the horse-drawn carriage in the same amount of time.
   - Therefore, the racehorse is faster than the horse-drawn carriage.

4. **Reaching the Next Town:**
   - Since speed directly correlates with how quickly an object can reach a destination, the racehorse, being faster, will reach the next town before the horse-drawn carriage.

5. **Selecting the Correct Option:**
   - Given the racehorse travels faster, it will not take more time to reach the next town; thus, it will take less time compared to the horse-drawn carriage.
   - Hence, the correct statement is that the horse-drawn carriage will take more time to reach the next town.

**Problem:** Diana and Dave boarded the same train at the same station. If Diana gets off the train after 75 minutes and Dave travels for 88 minutes before getting off, then who traveled a shorter distance?

**Option 1:** Diana  
**Option 2:** Dave

**Step-by-Step Solution and Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Both Diana and Dave board the same train at the same station and travel in the same direction.
   - Diana gets off the train after 75 minutes.
   - Dave stays on the train longer and gets off after 88 minutes.
   - We need to determine who traveled a shorter distance.

2. **Assumptions:**
   - The speed of the train is constant throughout the journey. This is a reasonable assumption unless specified otherwise.

3. **Calculating the Distances:**
   - Let’s denote the speed of the train as \( v \) (in kilometers per minute, km/min).
   - Distance is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

4. **Distance Traveled by Diana:**
   \[
   \text{Distance by Diana} = v \times 75
   \]

5. **Distance Traveled by Dave:**
   \[
   \text{Distance by Dave} = v \times 88
   \]

6. **Comparison:**
   - Since \( v \) is a common factor in both expressions, we only need to compare the times, 75 minutes and 88 minutes.
   - Clearly, \( 88 > 75 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Dave travels for a longer time (88 minutes) compared to Diana (75 minutes), and the speed is constant, Dave travels a greater distance than Diana.

Therefore, Diana traveled a shorter distance.

Mary has a cat that she likes to play with. Sometimes, she drags the cat's toy across the floor so that the cat can chase it. When she drags the cat's toy across the playroom floor, it moves 49 centimeters. When she drags it across the rumpus room floor, it moves 21 centimeters. Which is smoother?

#### Option 1: The playroom floor
#### Option 2: The rumpus room floor

### Solution:

To determine which floor is smoother, we need to understand that if a toy slides further with the same force applied, the surface is smoother. This is because a smoother surface reduces friction, allowing the object to travel further.

Let's analyze the given distances:

- The distance the toy travels on the playroom floor is **49 centimeters**.
- The distance the toy travels on the rumpus room floor is **21 centimeters**.

**Analysis:**

- **Playroom Floor:** Since the toy moves 49 centimeters, this suggests that the playroom floor has lower friction compared to the rumpus room floor, as the toy travels further on the same applied force.
  
- **Rumpus Room Floor:** Here, the toy only moves 21 centimeters, indicating higher friction compared to the playroom floor, as it does not travel as far.

Therefore, since the toy moves a greater distance on the playroom floor, it is the smoother surface.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the smoother floor is the one where the toy travels the greatest distance with the same amount of force applied. Therefore, the smoother floor is the playroom floor.

### Question:
Jim lives 10 miles from the server. Zarina lives 2000 miles away from the server. Both have the same internet speed. Whose ping will be higher?

### Options:
- **Option 1:** Jim
- **Option 2:** Zarina

## Solution

To solve this question, we need to understand what ""ping"" means in the context of internet connectivity. Ping is a measure of the time it takes for a data packet to travel from a sender to a receiver and back again. It is often measured in milliseconds (ms). A higher ping value indicates a longer time delay, which can be caused by the distance data has to travel, among other factors.

**Key Points to Consider:**
1. **Distance and Ping:** The farther the distance between a user and the server, the longer it generally takes for data packets to travel back and forth. Therefore, distance is a crucial factor affecting ping times.
2. **Jim vs. Zarina:**
   - Jim is located 10 miles from the server.
   - Zarina is located 2000 miles from the server.

Since both Jim and Zarina have the same internet speed, the primary factor affecting their ping will be the distance from the server. Because Zarina is much farther from the server than Jim, her ping will naturally be higher due to the increased travel distance for the data packets.

Therefore, the person with the higher ping will be the one living farther away from the server.

## Conclusion

Based on the information given:
- Jim is only 10 miles from the server.
- Zarina is 2000 miles from the server.

Thus, it is Zarina who will experience higher ping times because of the significantly greater distance.

**Question:** A robot cleans tiles in 7 minutes and plush carpet in 100 seconds because it has?

**Option 1:** More friction

**Option 2:** Less friction

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Cleaning Times:**
   - The robot takes **7 minutes** to clean tiles. Converting this to seconds: \( 7 \times 60 = 420 \) seconds.
   - The robot takes **100 seconds** to clean plush carpet.

2. **Analyzing Friction:**
   - **Friction** is the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another.
   - If the robot cleans tiles (a typically harder and smoother surface) in 420 seconds and plush carpet (a thicker and likely softer surface) in only 100 seconds, one might assume the friction is different for these surfaces.

3. **Evaluating Frictional Impact:**
   - **More Friction:** If a surface has more friction, it would generally take longer to clean because the robot must overcome more resistance.
   - **Less Friction:** If a surface has less friction, it would typically be easier and quicker to clean due to reduced resistance.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the robot takes longer to clean tiles (420 seconds) compared to plush carpet (100 seconds), it indicates that the robot experiences **more friction** on the tiles than on the plush carpet.
   - This could be because plush carpets, while thicker, may allow the robot's cleaning mechanism to move more freely, or it's optimized for the carpet, resulting in less effective cleaning time due to less resistance encountered.

Thus, the reason the robot cleans tiles in a longer time and plush carpet in a shorter time is due to **more friction** with the tiles.

### Question:
A brown mouse and a black mouse each run as fast as they can through a 50-foot tunnel. The black mouse reached the other end in 18 seconds and the brown mouse in 45 seconds. Which mouse cannot run faster?

### Options:
- **Option 1: Brown mouse**
- **Option 2: Black mouse**

## Detailed Solution:

To determine which mouse cannot run faster, we need to compare their speeds.

### Step 1: Calculate the speed of each mouse.

Speed is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

**For the black mouse:**
- Distance = 50 feet
- Time = 18 seconds

\[ \text{Speed of black mouse} = \frac{50 \text{ feet}}{18 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{25}{9} \text{ feet per second} \approx 2.78 \text{ feet per second} \]

**For the brown mouse:**
- Distance = 50 feet
- Time = 45 seconds

\[ \text{Speed of brown mouse} = \frac{50 \text{ feet}}{45 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{10}{9} \text{ feet per second} \approx 1.11 \text{ feet per second} \]

### Step 2: Compare the speeds.

- Speed of black mouse ≈ 2.78 feet per second
- Speed of brown mouse ≈ 1.11 feet per second

From the calculations, the black mouse is clearly faster than the brown mouse as it covers more feet in a second compared to the brown mouse.

### Conclusion:

The brown mouse is slower and hence cannot run faster than the black mouse.

## Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sarah runs for 48 minutes.
   - Jenny runs for an additional 56 minutes compared to Sarah.

2. **Calculate Jenny's Running Time:**
   - Since Jenny runs 56 minutes more than Sarah, we add these extra minutes to Sarah's running time.
   - Jenny's running time: \( 48 \text{ minutes} + 56 \text{ minutes} = 104 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Both Sarah and Jenny run at the same speed.
   - Distance is calculated as the product of speed and time.
   - Since the speed is constant and Jenny runs for 104 minutes while Sarah runs for 48 minutes, Jenny has run for more time.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since distance is directly proportional to time when speed is constant, the person who runs for a longer time will cover a greater distance.
   - Therefore, Jenny, running for 104 minutes compared to Sarah's 48 minutes, covers a greater distance than Sarah.

**Question:**  
It seems that Mohsin's coin is spinning at a speed of 2 cm/min on the ceramic plate and 1 cm/min on the paper plate. Does this mean his coin gets hotter on which plate?

**Options:**  
Option 1: Paper Plate  
Option 2: Ceramic Plate

### Detailed Solution with Explanations:

To determine where the coin gets hotter, we need to consider the factors that contribute to heat generation when an object moves or spins on a surface. The key element here is friction, which generates heat.

1. **Speed and Friction:**  
   - If the coin spins faster on the ceramic plate (2 cm/min) compared to the paper plate (1 cm/min), this implies that there is potentially more frictional interaction on the ceramic plate.
   - Generally, the faster an object moves across a surface, the more heat is generated due to increased friction.

2. **Material Property and Heat Dissipation:**  
   - In addition to speed, we must consider the material properties of the surfaces. Ceramic is typically smoother and might allow for less friction compared to paper. However, since the question states the coin spins twice as fast on the ceramic plate, the speed factor might outweigh the material factor.
   - Ceramic is also usually better at dissipating heat than paper. However, the act of spinning faster indicates that more initial heat is generated on the ceramic plate.

### Conclusion:

Since the coin spins faster on the ceramic plate, it suggests that more frictional heat is generated, which could result in the coin becoming hotter on the ceramic plate initially. The fact that it spins more slowly on the paper could mean either the paper surface is rougher, preventing heat accumulation, or simply less friction-generated heat due to lower speed.

Therefore, given the speed difference, the likely conclusion based on heat generation due to friction is:

### Question:
Sherry takes her ball below two lanes. The ball moves at a speed of 32 m/s in the red lane and at a speed of 27 m/s in the green lane. Why is the ball's speed higher in the red lane?

### Options:
- Option 1: More friction
- Option 2: Less friction

## Solution:

1. Begin by understanding the basic physics principle involved: Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are in contact. The more friction there is, the slower the object moves for a given applied force. Conversely, less friction allows for greater speed.

2. Sherry's ball is moving at different speeds in two different lanes, the red lane and the green lane. The speed of the ball is higher in the red lane (32 m/s) than in the green lane (27 m/s).

3. Compare the speeds in both lanes:
   - **Red Lane**: 32 m/s
   - **Green Lane**: 27 m/s

4. Given that the ball moves faster in the red lane, we can infer that the force opposing its motion, i.e., friction, must be less in the red lane as compared to the green lane.

5. Therefore, the reason the ball's speed is higher in the red lane is due to less friction in the red lane. Less friction allows the ball to maintain a higher speed.

### Question:
If a boat's speed is 4 meters/second and a submarine's speed is 47 meters/second, which vessel will take more time to make the same journey?

### Options:
- Option 1: Boat
- Option 2: Submarine

## Detailed Solution:

To determine which vessel takes more time for the same journey, we need to compare the times taken by the boat and the submarine to cover the same distance.

### Given:
- Speed of the boat = 4 meters/second
- Speed of the submarine = 47 meters/second

### Analysis:
The time taken to travel a certain distance is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

If both the boat and the submarine are covering the same distance, let this distance be \( D \) meters.

- **Time taken by the boat**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{boat}} = \frac{D}{4}
  \]

- **Time taken by the submarine**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{submarine}} = \frac{D}{47}
  \]

### Comparison:
To determine which time is greater, we compare the two expressions:
- \(\frac{D}{4}\) vs. \(\frac{D}{47}\).

Since \( 4 < 47 \), therefore:
\[
\frac{1}{4} > \frac{1}{47}
\]

This implies:
\[
\frac{D}{4} > \frac{D}{47}
\]

Thus, the time taken by the boat to cover the same distance is more than the time taken by the submarine.

**Conclusion:**
The boat will take more time to complete the same journey compared to the submarine.

**Question:** A swimmer crosses a lake in 5 minutes and crosses wet mud in 30 seconds. Which is less slippery?
- **Option 1:** Lake
- **Option 2:** Wet mud

## Step-by-Step Solution

To determine which surface is less slippery, we consider the speed at which the swimmer can traverse each terrain. The assumption is that the less time it takes to cross, the less resistance or ""slipperiness"" is present.

**1. Crossing the Lake:**
   - Time taken = 5 minutes = 300 seconds.

**2. Crossing the Wet Mud:**
   - Time taken = 30 seconds.

**Comparison:**
- The swimmer takes significantly more time to cross the lake (300 seconds) than the wet mud (30 seconds). 
- If a terrain takes longer to cross, it indicates higher drag or friction, suggesting that it is more slippery.

**Conclusion:**
- The lake takes longer to cross than the wet mud, which implies that the lake has more resistance or slipperiness. Therefore, wet mud is less slippery because it is traversed more quickly.

### Question:
Jim lives 37 miles from the server. Jarina lives 6800 miles from the server. Both have the same internet speed. Who will have a higher ping?

### Options:
Option 1: Jim  
Option 2: Jarina

## Solution:

### Understanding Ping:

Ping measures the round-trip time data takes to travel from a source to a destination and back. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms). Factors influencing ping include:

1. Distance from the server: Longer distances generally result in higher pings.
2. Network congestion, hardware, and internet speed. However, in this scenario, internet speed is stated to be the same.

### Analysis:

1. **Distance from the Server:**
   - Jim is 37 miles away.
   - Jarina is 6800 miles away.

2. **Impact of Distance on Ping:**
   - Since ping is affected by the distance data has to travel, the farther away the user is from the server, the longer it takes for the data to complete the round trip. Here, the significant difference in distance (6800 miles vs. 37 miles) means that the signal must travel a far greater distance to reach and return from Jarina's location compared to Jim's.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the distances are the most critical factor in this scenario and both operate with the same internet speed, Jarina will experience a significantly higher ping due to her greater distance from the server.

Therefore, the person with the higher ping will be Jarina.

**Question:**
A swimmer crosses a lake in 12 minutes and crosses wet mud in 31 minutes because _____ is smoother?

**Option 1:** Lake  
**Option 2:** Wet Mud  

### Solution:

To determine which surface is smoother, we analyze the time it takes for the swimmer to cross each surface. The underlying assumption is that the smoother the surface, the less friction or resistance it provides, allowing faster movement.

1. **Time to Cross the Lake:** 12 minutes
   - A lake consists of water which, for a swimmer, typically offers less resistance compared to moving through a non-water medium. A good swimmer can glide relatively smoothly through water due to its fluid nature.

2. **Time to Cross Wet Mud:** 31 minutes
   - Wet mud is a semi-solid surface that provides a lot more resistance because it is neither entirely solid nor fluid, complicating movement. It can slow someone down significantly due to the density and resistance it offers.

Given these points, it's clear that the swimmer takes less time to cross the lake compared to the wet mud. This indicates the lake is the smoother medium to traverse.

### Conclusion:
Since the swimmer crosses the lake in significantly less time, it implies that the lake is smoother than the wet mud.

**Question:**
Markus's son took a pool ball from the pool table to play around the house. He noticed that the pool ball rolled a distance of 5 meters on the marble floor and 2 meters on the shag rug. Which surface is smoother?

**Option 1:** Marble floor  
**Option 2:** Shag rug

### Solution:

To determine which surface is smoother, we need to consider how far the pool ball rolls on each surface. A smoother surface will have less friction, allowing the ball to roll farther compared to a rougher surface with more friction.

1. **Observation on Marble Floor:**
   - The pool ball rolls 5 meters.

2. **Observation on Shag Rug:**
   - The pool ball rolls 2 meters.

### Reasoning:

- **Friction** is the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another. A smoother surface generally has lower friction.
- Since the pool ball rolls a greater distance on the **marble floor** (5 meters) than on the **shag rug** (2 meters), it indicates that the marble floor presents less friction compared to the shag rug.
- Therefore, we can conclude that the marble floor is smoother than the shag rug because the lower friction on the marble floor allows the ball to roll a longer distance.

### Conclusion:

The marble floor is the smoother surface as the ball rolls farther on it.

### Question:
Mohsin is standing 40 cm away from a lantern and 89 cm away from a street light. Which light source appears brighter to him?

### Options:
- Option 1: Lantern
- Option 2: Street Light

## Detailed Solution:

To determine which light source appears brighter to Mohsin, we use the Inverse Square Law of Light, which states that the brightness or intensity of light perceived from a source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

\[ I \propto \frac{1}{d^2} \]

where \( I \) is the intensity of the light, and \( d \) is the distance from the light source.

Let's denote:
- \( I_1 \) as the intensity of light from the lantern,
- \( I_2 \) as the intensity of light from the street light.

Given:
- Distance to the Lantern = \( 40 \) cm
- Distance to the Street Light = \( 89 \) cm

According to the Inverse Square Law:

\[ I_1 \propto \frac{1}{40^2} \]
\[ I_2 \propto \frac{1}{89^2} \]

Now, let's calculate the relative intensities to understand which one is greater.

1. Square of distances:
   - \( 40^2 = 1600 \)
   - \( 89^2 = 7921 \)

2. Calculating relative intensities:
   - \( I_1 \propto \frac{1}{1600} \)
   - \( I_2 \propto \frac{1}{7921} \)

Comparing \( \frac{1}{1600} \) and \( \frac{1}{7921} \), since 1600 is less than 7921, \( \frac{1}{1600} \) is greater than \( \frac{1}{7921} \). Therefore, \( I_1 \) is greater than \( I_2 \).

Hence, the lantern appears brighter to Mohsin than the street light.

**Question:** Bill throws a small stone with a mass of 300 grams and a pebble with a mass of 400 grams. The pebble falls faster than the stone. What does this mean?

**Option 1:** Greater weight  
**Option 2:** Less weight

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To understand which option is correct, we need to analyze the situation from the perspective of basic physics and gravitational theory.

1. **Understanding Free Fall:** 
   In a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate due to gravity, regardless of their mass. This is because the acceleration due to gravity is constant. However, on Earth, air resistance plays a role in how fast an object falls.

2. **Air Resistance and Weight:**
   - Air resistance is a force that opposes the motion of an object through air. It is dependent on several factors, including the velocity of the object, the surface area of the object, and the drag coefficient.
   - In general, heavier objects tend to have a greater ability to overcome air resistance compared to lighter objects when other factors such as shape and size are comparable.

3. **Comparison of the Stone and Pebble:**
   - The mass of the stone is 300 grams, and the mass of the pebble is 400 grams.
   - Given that the pebble falls faster than the stone, if all other conditions such as shape and size are similar, the primary factor possibly affecting their fall is mass (and hence weight, which depends on mass).

4. **Implication of Falling Faster:**
   - The fact that the pebble (400 grams) falls faster than the stone (300 grams) suggests that the pebble has a greater mass and therefore potentially a greater ability to overcome air resistance.
   - Thus, the observation that the pebble falls faster than the stone implies that it has a greater weight.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the pebble's greater weight allows it to fall more rapidly through the air than the stone.

**Question:** A chicken can run at a speed of 140 cm/second, and a turkey can run at a speed of 4 m/second. If both run towards the shed from the barn, who will arrive there faster?
- **Option 1:** Chicken
- **Option 2:** Turkey

## Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to compare the speeds of the chicken and turkey to determine who will reach the shed first.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Convert units for comparison:**
   - The speed of the chicken is given in centimeters per second (cm/s), while the speed of the turkey is given in meters per second (m/s).
   - We should convert one of these speeds to the same unit for easy comparison.

2. **Convert turkey's speed to cm/second:**
   - 1 meter = 100 centimeters
   - The turkey's speed is 4 m/s. Converting this to cm/s:
     \[
     4 \, \text{m/s} = 4 \times 100 \, \text{cm/s} = 400 \, \text{cm/s}
     \]

3. **Compare the speeds:**
   - Chicken's speed: 140 cm/s
   - Turkey's speed: 400 cm/s

4. **Analyze the comparison:**
   - The turkey runs at 400 cm/s, which is faster than the chicken's speed of 140 cm/s.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Since the turkey runs faster than the chicken when both speeds are expressed in the same unit (cm/s), the turkey will arrive at the shed faster.

Therefore, the correct answer is the turkey.

### Question:
The weight of a football is 300 grams, and the weight of a lead piece is 800 grams. If both are thrown on a field, which one will accelerate faster?

### Options:
- **Option 1:** Lead piece
- **Option 2:** Football

## Solution

According to Newton's second law of motion, the acceleration (\(a\)) of an object is determined by the net force (\(F\)) acting on it and is inversely proportional to its mass (\(m\)):

\[ a = \frac{F}{m} \]

In this scenario, assuming that both the football and the lead piece are subjected to the same force, the object with the lower mass will have a higher acceleration because acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. 

Let's compare the masses in this problem:
- Mass of the football = 300 grams
- Mass of the lead piece = 800 grams

The football, having a smaller mass, will experience greater acceleration when the same force is applied to both the football and the lead piece.

## Conclusion
The football will accelerate faster than the lead piece when they are thrown with the same force.

**Question:** A robot cleans tiles in 10 seconds and plush carpet in 14 seconds because of what reason?

- **Option 1:** More
- **Option 2:** Less

## Detailed Solution:

The question describes a scenario involving a robot that takes different amounts of time to clean two different surfaces: tiles and a plush carpet. Specifically, it takes 10 seconds for tiles and 14 seconds for the plush carpet.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Time Analysis:**
   - Cleaning Time for Tiles = 10 seconds
   - Cleaning Time for Plush Carpet = 14 seconds

2. **Relation to Friction:**
   - The question indicates that the difference in cleaning times might be due to friction.
   - Friction is the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another. 

3. **Friction on Different Surfaces:**
   - **Tiles:** Generally, tiles have a smoother surface compared to plush carpets. Therefore, friction is relatively lower, allowing the robot to clean faster, i.e., in less time (10 seconds).
   - **Plush Carpet:** Plush carpets have a rougher and more textured surface compared to tiles. The pile of the carpet increases the friction, making it more difficult for a robot to clean, resulting in taking more time (14 seconds).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The robot takes longer to clean plush carpets than tiles due to **more friction** on the plush carpet compared to the tiles. This friction reduces the robot's efficiency on the carpet.

By evaluating the effect of friction on the cleaning duration, we can conclude that the robot's increased cleaning time for plush carpets is due to more friction.

Therefore, the correct answer is **""Option 1: More""**.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

To solve the question of which object has a stronger gravitational field, we need to understand how gravitational fields are related to mass.

1. **Concept of Gravitational Field:**
   - The gravitational field or gravitational force around an object is directly related to its mass. The greater the mass of an object, the stronger its gravitational field. 

2. **Given Data:**

   - Mass of the pebble = 0.3 kg

3. **Comparison of Masses:**
   - The mass of the steel ball (13 kg) is significantly larger than the mass of the pebble (0.3 kg).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since gravitational field strength is directly proportional to the object's mass, the steel ball, with a mass of 13 kg, will have a stronger gravitational field compared to the pebble, which has a mass of only 0.3 kg.

Thus, among the two objects, the steel ball has a stronger gravitational field.

**Question:** Mahi's weight is 600 Newton, whereas his friend Musa's weight is 800 Newton. Who is likely to have less mass?

**Option 1:** Mahi

**Option 2:** Musa

### Solution:

To determine who is likely to have less mass, we need to understand the relationship between weight and mass. The weight (W) of an object is calculated by the equation:

\[ W = m \times g \]

Where:
- \( W \) is the weight in Newtons.
- \( m \) is the mass in kilograms.
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Given:
- Mahi's weight (\( W_{\text{Mahi}} \)) = 600 N
- Musa's weight (\( W_{\text{Musa}} \)) = 800 N

We are comparing their masses. In the context of Earth where \( g \) is constant, mass is directly proportional to weight.

Calculating mass:
- Mahi's mass \( m_{\text{Mahi}} = \frac{W_{\text{Mahi}}}{g} = \frac{600}{9.8} \approx 61.22 \, \text{kg} \)
- Musa's mass \( m_{\text{Musa}} = \frac{W_{\text{Musa}}}{g} = \frac{800}{9.8} \approx 81.63 \, \text{kg} \)

Comparison:
- Mahi's mass = 61.22 kg
- Musa's mass = 81.63 kg

Since 61.22 kg (Mahi) is less than 81.63 kg (Musa), Mahi has less mass.

Therefore, the person with likely less mass is **Mahi**.

## Solution

1. **Understanding the Units and Terms**:
   - The unit kg\*m/s^2 is equivalent to a Newton (N), which is a unit of force in the International System of Units (SI).
   - When discussing weight and mass:
     - Weight (W) is the force exerted by gravity on an object and is calculated as \( W = m \times g \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth).

2. **Given Data**:
   - Mahir's weight = 480 N (since 480 kg\*m/s^2 = 480 N)
   - Musa's weight = 650 N

3. **Calculating Mass**:
   - For Mahi:
     \[
     m_{\text{Mahi}} = \frac{\text{Weight of Mahi}}{g} = \frac{480 \text{ N}}{9.8 \text{ m/s}^2} \approx 48.98 \text{ kg}

### Question
The weight of an empty cement truck is approximately 7258 kg. Later, 18 bags of cement, each weighing 42 kg, are loaded onto the truck. Does it move faster or slower when it was moving without the cement bags?

### Options
- Option 1: Faster
- Option 2: Slower

## Solution

1. **Determine the total weight of the cement bags:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight of the cement bags} = (\text{number of bags}) \times (\text{weight of each bag})
   \]
   \[
   = 18 \times 42 \text{ kg} = 756 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the truck with the cement:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight of truck with cement} = (\text{weight of empty truck}) + (\text{total weight of cement bags})
   \]
   \[
   = 7258 \text{ kg} + 756 \text{ kg} = 8014 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Reasoning about movement speed:**
   - When the truck is empty, its total weight is 7258 kg.
   - When the truck is loaded with cement, its total weight is 8014 kg.
   - A truck's speed is generally inversely related to its load; the heavier the load, the more effort and time it requires to attain the same speed. Hence, a greater total weight indicates less acceleration capability and generally slower movement.

4. **Comparison of movement speeds:**
   - The empty truck (7258 kg) would move faster compared to when it's fully loaded with cement (8014 kg), as the increased load would naturally slow down the truck due to higher inertia and increased resistance.

Thus, the truck moves **slower** when carrying the cement bags than when it is empty.

**Question:**  
Mary’s skateboard moves at a speed of 3985 cm/second when she is skating in a wet skatepark and at 829 cm/second when she is skating in a dry skatepark. Does this mean her skateboard gets hotter when she rides it?

**Options:**  
**Option 1:** Wet skatepark  
**Option 2:** Dry skatepark  

## Solution

The question revolves around the speed difference of Mary’s skateboard in wet and dry conditions and its impact on the skateboard's temperature.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Skateboard Speed and Temperature Relation:**
   - Generally, moving at higher speeds can often lead to increased friction and subsequently greater heat generation due to friction between the skateboard wheels and the ground.
   - However, in a wet skatepark, the presence of water can reduce friction compared to a dry surface, potentially affecting how heat develops.

2. **Speed Comparison:**
   - In a **wet skatepark**, the skateboard's speed is **3985 cm/second**.
   - In a **dry skatepark**, the skateboard's speed is **829 cm/second**.

3. **Implication of Higher Speed on Heat:**
   - Higher speed often means more kinetic energy is involved, which could lead to greater heat generation if not offset by environmental factors.
   - However, in the wet skatepark scenario, the increased speed does not necessarily correlate to more heat because the water likely acts as a cooling agent or medium reducing frictional heat.

4. **Conclusion Based on Speed vs. Temperature:**
   - Despite being faster in the wet skatepark, the skateboard moving slower in the dry skatepark indicates that more friction is possibly present in the dry skatepark.
   - Therefore, the skateboard would likely generate more heat in the **dry skatepark** because the friction without the water reducing it likely results in more heat production.

Thus, considering these factors, we conclude that the skateboard gets hotter when Mary skates in the dry skatepark.

**Question:**  
A brown mouse and a black mouse each run as fast as possible through a 50-foot tunnel. The black mouse reaches the other end in 11 seconds and the brown mouse in 25 seconds. Which mouse runs relatively less fast?

**Option 1:** The brown mouse  
**Option 2:** The black mouse

## Solution:

To determine which mouse runs relatively less fast, we will calculate the speed of each mouse and then compare.

### Step 1: Calculate the speeds

#### Brown Mouse:
- Distance = 50 feet
- Time = 25 seconds
- Speed of brown mouse = Distance / Time = 50 feet / 25 seconds = 2 feet per second

#### Black Mouse:
- Distance = 50 feet
- Time = 11 seconds
- Speed of black mouse = Distance / Time = 50 feet / 11 seconds ≈ 4.545 feet per second

### Step 2: Compare the speeds

- Speed of brown mouse = 2 feet per second
- Speed of black mouse ≈ 4.545 feet per second

The brown mouse runs at 2 feet per second, while the black mouse runs faster at approximately 4.545 feet per second. Therefore, the brown mouse is slower compared to the black mouse.

## Conclusion:

The mouse that runs relatively less fast is the brown mouse.

### Question:
Bill throws a rock weighing 257 grams and a pebble weighing 656 grams. The pebble falls faster than the rock. What does this mean?

### Options:
1. Option 1: Greater weight
2. Option 2: Lesser weight

## Solution

When analyzing objects falling under the influence of gravity, several physical principles come into play. The scenario presented here involves a comparison of the falling speeds of two objects, where a larger weight—or mass—concept is juxtaposed with a more nuanced understanding involving air resistance and other dynamics.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Gravity and Free Fall:** In the absence of air resistance (like in a vacuum), all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass, due to gravity. This means that the acceleration due to gravity is constant at approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

2. **Air Resistance:** In the presence of an atmosphere (like on Earth), air resistance acts on objects. The force of air resistance depends on factors such as the size, shape, and speed of the object.

3. **Terminal Velocity:** Heavier objects or those with certain shapes may reach a terminal velocity that allows them to fall at different rates. Terminal velocity is reached when the force of gravity is balanced by air resistance, so the object falls at constant speed.

### Analysis:
- Given a rock with a mass of 257 grams and a pebble with a mass of 656 grams, one might first think the pebble is heavier. However, if the pebble falls faster, it is necessary to think beyond just weight.
- The scenario suggests evaluating not just the weight but also the effect of shape and air resistance on fall speed.
- If the pebble falls faster, it may have a shape or mass distribution that encounters less air resistance relative to its weight compared to the rock. However, without further data on shape or density, basic assumptions based on weight behavior under gravity aren't wholly sufficient.

### Conclusion:
Though in free conditions heavier objects fall as fast, the question specifically states one object falls faster due to weight implications or other effects like lesser resistance impacting fall speed.

Therefore, the answer is indicative of a relative impact or assumption regarding weight.

A young child rolls a ball on the grass for more than 1 minute and then rolls it onto the sand, where it stops after 43 seconds. The sand stopped the ball because it has _____ compared to the grass.

**Options Translation:**
Option 1: More friction  
Option 2: Less friction  

### Solution and Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to understand the role of friction in stopping a moving object. 

1. **Definition of Friction:**
   - Friction is the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another. It acts in the opposite direction to the motion of the object.

2. **Friction on Different Surfaces:**
   - Different surfaces have different levels of friction. Rough surfaces like sand usually have higher friction compared to smoother surfaces like grass.

3. **Effect of Friction on the Ball:**
   - A ball rolling on grass maintains its motion for more than 1 minute, which implies that the friction on grass is relatively low, allowing the ball to keep rolling for a longer time.
   - When the ball rolls onto the sand, it stops within 43 seconds, which is less time compared to rolling on grass. This indicates that the sand has higher friction. Higher friction means more resistance to motion, causing the ball to stop faster.

Given these points, the ball stops more quickly on sand than on grass due to increased friction on sand. Therefore, sand has **more friction** than grass.

### Conclusion

The correct option, reflecting why the ball stops sooner on the sand due to its higher friction compared to grass, is:

**Question:**
Lisa was playing with two model rockets. She launched both rockets into the sky at the same time. After 30 seconds, the black rocket was 2 meters above the ground and the red rocket was 23 centimeters above the ground. Which one had higher speed?

**Option 1:** The red one  
**Option 2:** The black one

### Solution:

To determine which rocket had the higher speed, we need to compare the distances each rocket traveled above the ground in 30 seconds. 

1. **Distance Covered by the Black Rocket:**
   - The black rocket was 2 meters above the ground.
   - We can write this distance in meters: \(2 \text{ meters}\).

2. **Distance Covered by the Red Rocket:**
   - The red rocket was 23 centimeters above the ground.
   - We need to convert this distance to meters for an accurate comparison:  
     \(23 \text{ cm} = 0.23 \text{ meters}\).

3. **Comparison of Distances:**
   - Black rocket's distance: \(2 \text{ meters}\)
   - Red rocket's distance: \(0.23 \text{ meters}\)

4. **Determine Which Rocket Had Higher Speed:**
   - Speed is calculated as distance divided by time. Since both rockets were timed over the same period (30 seconds), we only need to compare the distances.
   - The black rocket covered \(2 \text{ meters}\) in the same time the red rocket covered \(0.23 \text{ meters}\).

Since the black rocket traveled a greater distance in the same amount of time, it had higher speed.

### Conclusion:

The black rocket had a higher speed. Therefore, the correct option is **""Option 2""**.

   - Question: Mohsin was comparing the weight of a rock and a pebble. He found that the weight of the rock was 148 pounds and the weight of the pebble was 2 pounds. Which item emits stronger gravitational force?
   - Option 1: Rock
   - Option 2: Pebble

2. **Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations in English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between mass and gravitational force. The gravitational force exerted by an object is directly proportional to its mass. This means that the greater the mass of an object, the stronger the gravitational force it exerts.

   Given Data:
   - Mass of the rock = 148 pounds
   - Mass of the pebble = 2 pounds

   According to the law of gravitation, the force of gravity \( F \) can be defined by the formula:

   \[
   F = G \frac{m_1 \times m_2}{r^2}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( F \) is the gravitational force.
   - \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
   - \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects.
   - \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.

   In this context, we are considering the gravitational force emitted by each of the masses individually relative to Earth. Since both objects are being compared in the same environment and the same distance from Earth, the gravitational pull will primarily depend on their mass.

   - The mass of the rock is significantly larger than the mass of the pebble (148 pounds vs. 2 pounds).
   - Therefore, the rock has a larger mass and will emit a stronger gravitational force compared to the pebble.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Based on the relationship between mass and gravitational force, the rock, having a greater mass, will emit a stronger gravitational force than the pebble.

**Question:** Diana and Dave boarded the same train at the same station. If Diana gets off the train after 10 minutes and Dave travels for 15 minutes and then gets off, who traveled a shorter distance?

**Option 1:** Diana  
**Option 2:** Dave

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between time and distance when traveling at a constant speed, which is typical of a train journey. The basic formula that links distance, speed, and time is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since both Diana and Dave are traveling on the same train, we can assume the speed of the train, denoted as \( v \), is constant for both of them.

### Calculation

1. **Diana's Journey:**
   - Time traveled by Diana: 10 minutes.
   - Distance traveled by Diana: 
     \[
     d_d = v \times 10 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

2. **Dave's Journey:**
   - Time traveled by Dave: 15 minutes.
   - Distance traveled by Dave:
     \[
     d_{dv} = v \times 15 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

### Comparison

To find out who traveled a shorter distance, compare the two expressions:
- \( d_d = v \times 10 \)
- \( d_{dv} = v \times 15 \)

Since the speed \( v \) is positive and constant, we can see:
\[ 10v < 15v \]

Therefore, Diana traveled a shorter distance than Dave.

**Conclusion:**

After comparing the distances, we conclude that Diana traveled a shorter distance than Dave because she remained on the train for a shorter period. Thus, the correct option is:

**Question:** Tina and Mina are both traveling on the highway at the same speed. Tina drives for 12 minutes and 56 seconds, and Mina drives for 36 minutes and 48 seconds. Who will travel a longer distance?

**Option 1:** Tina  
**Option 2:** Mina  

## Solution

Both Tina and Mina are traveling at the same speed on the highway. Therefore, the distance each travels is proportional to the time they spend driving. The one who drives longer will cover a greater distance.

1. **Convert both driving times to seconds for easy comparison:**

   - **Tina's driving time:**
     - Minutes to seconds: \(12 \text{ minutes} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ seconds}\)
     - Total seconds: \(720 \text{ seconds} + 56 \text{ seconds} = 776 \text{ seconds}\)

   - **Mina's driving time:**
     - Minutes to seconds: \(36 \text{ minutes} = 36 \times 60 = 2160 \text{ seconds}\)
     - Total seconds: \(2160 \text{ seconds} + 48 \text{ seconds} = 2208 \text{ seconds}\)

2. **Compare the driving times:**

   - Tina's driving time: 776 seconds
   - Mina's driving time: 2208 seconds

Since Mina has a longer driving time (2208 seconds) compared to Tina's (776 seconds), Mina will travel a longer distance.

## Conclusion

Mina drives for more time than Tina, so Mina will travel a greater distance on the highway.

**Option 1:** There was more friction.

**Option 2:** There was less friction.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Conversion of Units:**
   - First, we need to convert the time Rose took to ski down each hill into the same units for easy comparison.
   - The snowy hill time is already given as 0.53 hours.
   - To convert the muddy hill time from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor: 1 hour = 60 minutes.
     \[
     \text{Time for muddy hill (in hours)} = \frac{48 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 0.8 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Comparison of times:**
   - It took Rose 0.8 hours to descend the muddy hill and 0.53 hours to descend the snowy hill.
   - Clearly, it took more time to ski down the muddy hill than the snowy hill.

3. **Understanding the Effect of Friction:**
   - Friction is a force that resists the sliding motion of two surfaces in contact.
   - Mud likely increases the friction because it is typically sticky and can increase resistance.
   - Snow usually offers less resistance and is smoother, which implies less friction compared to mud.

4. **Conclusion about the role of friction:**
   - Since it took longer to ski down the muddy hill, this suggests that there was more resistance going down that hill.
   - More resistance is consistent with higher friction.
   - Therefore, the increased time can be attributed to higher friction caused by the muddy surface compared to the snowy surface which provides less friction.

Hence, **the presence of mud likely increased the friction**, making it take longer to ski down the muddy hill.

**Question:** Jimbo knows that the mass of his marble is 6 grams and the mass of the stone is 14 grams. What does this mean?

**Option 1:** The gravitational force of the marble is greater.
**Option 2:** The gravitational force of the stone is greater.

## Detailed Solution:

To determine the gravitational force acting on an object, we use the formula:

\[
F = m \times g
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force,
- \( m \) is the mass of the object, and
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) on Earth).

Given:
- The mass of the marble \( m_{\text{marble}} = 6 \, \text{g} = 0.006 \, \text{kg} \)
- The mass of the stone \( m_{\text{stone}} = 14 \, \text{g} = 0.014 \, \text{kg} \)

### Calculating the Gravitational Force:

1. **For the Marble:**
   \[
   F_{\text{marble}} = m_{\text{marble}} \times g = 0.006 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 0.0588 \, \text{N}
   \]

2. **For the Stone:**
   \[
   F_{\text{stone}} = m_{\text{stone}} \times g = 0.014 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 0.1372 \, \text{N}
   \]

### Comparing the Gravitational Forces:
- The gravitational force acting on the marble is \( 0.0588 \, \text{N} \).
- The gravitational force acting on the stone is \( 0.1372 \, \text{N} \).

Since \( 0.1372 \, \text{N} > 0.0588 \, \text{N} \), the stone experiences a greater gravitational force than the marble.

**Question**: Mohsin's truck has an average speed of 13 miles per hour, and his car has a speed of 29 miles per hour. If he drives both vehicles for an hour on the freeway, which one will cover a greater distance?

**Option 1**: Truck  
**Option 2**: Car

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance each vehicle will cover in one hour, given their respective speeds.

1. **Calculate the Distance Covered by the Truck**:

   - The speed of the truck is 13 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time.
   - Since the truck is driven for 1 hour, the distance covered by the truck = 13 miles per hour × 1 hour = 13 miles.

2. **Calculate the Distance Covered by the Car**:

   - The speed of the car is 29 miles per hour.
   - Likewise, the Distance = Speed × Time.
   - The car's distance = 29 miles per hour × 1 hour = 29 miles.

3. **Compare the Distances**:

   - The truck covers 13 miles in one hour.
   - The car covers 29 miles in one hour.

Since 29 miles (covered by the car) is greater than 13 miles (covered by the truck), the car travels a greater distance.

**Conclusion**: The car will cover a greater distance when both vehicles are driven for an hour.

**Question:**  
Kate is in a movie and accidentally drops her cup on the floor. The cup rolls for 4 seconds on a concrete floor, covering 13 meters, but after hitting a carpeted floor, it moves 9 meters in 7 seconds. Was the cup slower on the carpeted floor because the carpeted floor had:

**Option 1:** More friction  
**Option 2:** Less friction

## Solution

To determine the reason why the cup slowed down on the carpeted floor, we need to analyze the relationship between friction and motion. Friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object. 

1. **Concrete Floor Analysis:**
   - Distance covered = 13 meters
   - Time taken = 4 seconds
   - Speed on the concrete floor:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{13 \text{ meters}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 3.25 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

2. **Carpeted Floor Analysis:**
   - Distance covered = 9 meters
   - Time taken = 7 seconds
   - Speed on the carpeted floor:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{9 \text{ meters}}{7 \text{ seconds}} \approx 1.29 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

3. **Comparison:**
   - On the concrete floor, the speed was 3.25 meters/second.
   - On the carpeted floor, the speed was approximately 1.29 meters/second.

It is clear from this comparison that the cup was moving slower on the carpeted floor than on the concrete floor.

4. **Reason for Slow Speed:**
   - The primary factor that causes an object to move more slowly on one surface than on another is friction. 
   - Concrete is a smoother surface compared to carpet, leading to less friction.
   - Carpet, being a softer and more textured surface, increases the friction experienced by the object, resulting in a slower motion.

Therefore, the cup was slower on the carpeted floor because the carpeted floor had **more friction**.

**Question:** A cat and a dog both run at a speed of 5 miles per hour. If the cat runs for 2 minutes and the dog runs for 45 seconds, which one will cover a greater distance?

**Option 1:** Cat  
**Option 2:** Dog

## Solution

To determine which animal covers a greater distance, we need to calculate the distance each one travels using the formula for distance:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by the cat.

- **Speed of the cat:** 5 miles per hour
- **Time the cat runs:** 2 minutes

First, convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ minutes} = \frac{2}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance:

\[ \text{Distance covered by the cat} = 5 \text{ miles per hour} \times \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{30} \text{ miles} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the dog.

- **Speed of the dog:** 5 miles per hour
- **Time the dog runs:** 45 seconds

Convert the time from seconds to hours.

\[ 45 \text{ seconds} = \frac{45}{3600} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{80} \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance:

\[ \text{Distance covered by the dog} = 5 \text{ miles per hour} \times \frac{1}{80} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{80} \text{ miles} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles} \]

### Step 3: Compare the distances

- **Distance covered by the cat:** \(\frac{1}{6} \text{ miles}\)
- **Distance covered by the dog:** \(\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles}\)

To compare \(\frac{1}{6}\) and \(\frac{1}{16}\), convert each to a common denominator.

The least common multiple of 6 and 16 is "

### Question:
Mary's skateboard moves at a speed of 2 m/s when she skates on a wet skatepark and at a speed of 6 m/s when she skates on a dry skatepark. This means her skateboard heats up more in which place?

### Options:
- Option 1: Wet skatepark
- Option 2: Dry skatepark

## Solution

To determine where Mary's skateboard heats up more, we need to understand how speed can affect the heat generation in the skateboard.

**Concept:**

1. **Friction:** Friction between the skateboard wheels and the ground causes heat generation. The type of surface (wet or dry) affects the level of friction.

2. **Speed and Frictional Force:** Generally, a higher speed can increase the frictional force experienced by the moving object if the surface contact remains the same.

3. **Frictional Heating:** When a skateboard moves over a dry surface with higher interaction between the wheels and the surface, it can lead to more heat generation due to increased frictional forces compared to moving over a wet surface.

**Analysis:**

- On a **dry surface**, Mary's skateboard is capable of moving faster (6 m/s), which indicates that either the wheels grip the surface better or there is less resistance compared to the wet surface.
- On a **wet surface**, the skateboard moves slower (2 m/s). The wet surface likely reduces friction significantly, leading to reduced speed and potentially less heat generation since less kinetic energy is converted into heat.

Since friction and thus heat improves with a better grip and faster movement over a dry surface, it is logical to deduce that the skateboard heats up more when moving at the higher speed on the dry surface.

Therefore, the skateboard generates more heat at the dry skatepark.

**Conclusion:**

The correct choice, indicating where Mary's skateboard heats up more due to friction at a higher speed, is:

**Question:** A dog liked to roam around the neighborhood. On Tuesday, the dog went out on the street for 1 hour and 53 minutes, and on Wednesday, the dog went out and stopped after 330 minutes. On which day did the dog walk longer?

**Option 1:** On Tuesday  
**Option 2:** On Wednesday

### Solution

To solve the problem, we need to compare the time durations given in different units, convert these into a single unit, and determine on which day the dog walked longer.

1. **Convert Tuesday's time into minutes:**
   - Tuesday: 1 hour 53 minutes
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the time on Tuesday is:
     \[
     (1 \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour}) + 53 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 53 \text{ minutes} = 113 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time for Wednesday is already given in minutes:**
   - Wednesday: 330 minutes

3. **Compare the times:**
   - Tuesday: 113 minutes
   - Wednesday: 330 minutes

Clearly, 330 minutes (Wednesday) is greater than 113 minutes (Tuesday).

### Conclusion

The dog walked for a longer duration on Wednesday.

### Question:
If a skater rides at a speed of 27 m/s on the road and at a speed of 29 m/s in a skate park, which means _____ is less smooth?

### Options:
- Option 1: Skate park
- Option 2: Road

## Solution:

To determine which surface is less smooth, we need to consider the speeds provided for the skater on two different surfaces: the road and the skate park.

**Step 1: Interpretation of Speeds**

- The skater rides at **27 m/s** on the road.
- The skater rides at **29 m/s** in the skate park.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Relationship between Speed and Surface Smoothness**

In general, a smoother surface allows for greater speed because there is less resistance against the motion of the skater. Therefore, if the skater is able to ride faster at a given location, it likely indicates that the surface is smoother.

**Step 3: Comparison**

- **On the Road:** The speed is 27 m/s.
- **In the Skate Park:** The speed is 29 m/s.

Since the speed is higher in the skate park (29 m/s) compared to the road (27 m/s), it indicates that the skate park has a smoother surface than the road. 

Thus, the lower speed on the road implies that the road is less smooth compared to the skate park.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the road is less smooth.

**Conclusion:**

The surface that is **less smooth** is the one where the skater rides at a lower speed.

- **Option 1:** Skate park (This is incorrect because the skater has a higher speed here, indicating it is smoother.)
- **Option 2:** Road (This is correct because the skater's speed is lower here, suggesting it's less smooth than the skate park.)

**Question:** Mark has noticed that on average, he can throw his lawn dart approximately 23 meters on soft soil and 19 meters on sand. This means that _____ is rougher?

**Option 1:** Soft soil  
**Option 2:** Sand

## Detailed Solution:

To determine which surface is rougher, we have to consider the concept of roughness in terms of how it affects the throw distance of the lawn dart. Generally, a rougher surface will create more friction or resistance, causing objects to not travel as far compared to a smoother surface.

- **Soft soil:** Mark's average throw distance is 23 meters.
- **Sand:** Mark's average throw distance is 19 meters.

Since Mark can throw the dart a longer distance on soft soil (23 meters) than in sand (19 meters), this implies that the soft soil offers less resistance compared to sand. Therefore, the surface that creates more resistance or has more roughness, which is sand in this scenario since it reduces the throw distance, would be considered rougher.

## Conclusion:

Based on the analysis that a rougher surface reduces the distance the dart travels, and since the dart travels a shorter distance on sand, it indicates that sand is the rougher surface.

### Question:
The team's ring rolls 8.1 cm on the field and 3.2 cm on the floor. Which one is smoother?

### Options:
- Option 1: Floor
- Option 2: Field

## Solution:

To determine which surface is smoother, we need to understand how the ring's rolling distances relate to the surface's smoothness.

### Analysis:

1. **Conceptual Understanding**: 
   - When a ring or wheel rolls a greater distance on a surface with the same force applied, it typically indicates that the surface is smoother, as there is less friction to impede the roll.
   - Conversely, a shorter rolling distance may suggest a rougher surface, as increased friction would cause the ring to stop earlier.

2. **Given Data for Analysis**:
   - Distance rolled on the Field = 8.1 cm
   - Distance rolled on the Floor = 3.2 cm

3. **Reasoning**:
   - The ring rolls significantly farther on the field (8.1 cm) compared to the floor (3.2 cm).
   - This suggests that the field offers less resistance or friction to the rolling ring than the floor does.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the ring rolls a longer distance on the field, the field is likely the smoother surface compared to the floor.

Therefore, the field is smoother than the floor.

- ""The weight of an empty cement truck is about 33000 pounds. Later, 34 bags of cement, each weighing 38 kg, are loaded onto the truck. Does the truck run ______ faster when there are no cement bags?""

**Options Translation:**
- Option 1: faster
- Option 2: slower

### Step 2: Understanding the Problem
1. **Weight of the Empty Truck:** The weight of the truck without any load is given as 33,000 pounds.
2. **Weight of the Cement Bags:**
   - Number of bags = 34
   - Weight per bag = 38 kg

   Since 1 kg = 2.20462 pounds, the total weight of the cement bags in pounds is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = 34 \times 38 \times 2.20462
   \]

3. **Calculation of Total Weight of Cement Bags:**
   \[
   = 34 \times 38 \times 2.20462 \approx 34 \times 83.77556 = 2848.368 pounds
   \]

4. **Total Weight with Cement Bags:**
   The total weight of the truck when loaded with cement bags:
   \[
   \text{Total loaded weight} = 33,000 + 2,848.368 \approx 35,848.368 pounds
   \]

### Step 3: Logical Reasoning
- **Effect of Weight on Speed:** Generally, when a vehicle is heavier, it moves slower due to the increased load and additional force required to move the heavier mass.
- Since the truck is heavier with the cement bags, it will naturally run slower compared to when it is empty.

### Conclusion
Considering the influence of the extra weight, the truck runs faster without the cement bags.

Emily throws a banana onto the roof, and it slides for 15 mm. But when she throws it onto the slide, it slides for 3 cm. Where was there less friction?

### Options:
- **Option 1:** Roof
- **Option 2:** Slide

## Solution:

To determine where there was less friction, we look at how far each surface allowed the banana to slide. In general, a surface with less friction allows an object to slide further. 

1. **Convert Units for Consistency:**
   - The roof sliding distance is given in millimeters (mm), and the slide distance is given in centimeters (cm).
   - Let's convert the roof distance from millimeters to centimeters for comparison:
     \[
     15 \text{ mm} = 1.5 \text{ cm}
     \]

2. **Compare the Sliding Distances:**
   - On the roof, the banana slides **1.5 cm**.
   - On the slide, the banana slides **3 cm**.

3. **Determine Less Friction:**
   - Since the banana slides more on the slide (3 cm) than on the roof (1.5 cm), this indicates that there is less friction on the slide.

Therefore, where the banana slides further, there is less friction. In this case, the slide allows the banana to slide farther than the roof.

**Question:**  
Kevin took a plane from New York to Chicago at 19:10 hours, and Esther took a plane from New York to Los Angeles at 14:30 hours. They both traveled on the same type of airplane, so their travel speeds are the same. Both arrived at their destinations at the same time. Who traveled more?

**Options:**  
- **Option 1:** Kevin  
- **Option 2:** Esther  

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Scenario:**
   - Both Kevin and Esther board their respective flights at different times.
   - Both flights land at their respective destinations at the same moment.
   - The speeds of both airplanes are the same, meaning the distance depends on the time traveled.

2. **List the Departure and Arrival Times:**
   - Kevin departs at 19:10 and arrives at an unspecified time.
   - Esther departs at 14:30 and arrives at the same unspecified time as Kevin.

3. **Determine Travel Times:**
   - Since both flights land at the same time and travel at the same speed, the time between departure and arrival for each should be calculated to determine the distance covered (since distance = speed x time).

4. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - Let the common arrival time be \( T \).
   - Kevin’s travel time: \( T - 19:10 \).
   - Esther’s travel time: \( T - 14:30 \).

5. **Compare the Travel Durations:**
   - Since Esther departed earlier at 14:30 compared to Kevin's departure at 19:10 and they both arrived simultaneously, the difference in their travel times will tell us who traveled more.
   - If both landed at the same time, the larger travel time corresponds to the longer distance covered, due to the constant speed.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Esther departed earlier and traveled for a longer duration. Therefore, she covered more distance because time and distance are directly related through constant speed.

Hence, **Esther traveled more.**

**Question:**
Mary's skateboard moves at a speed of 6 m/s when she is skating in a wet skate park compared to 789 cm/s when she skates in a dry skate park. Where does her skateboard get hotter?

**Option 1:** Wet skate park  
**Option 2:** Dry skate park

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Speeds:**
   - In the wet skate park, Mary's skateboard speed is given as 6 meters per second (m/s).
   - In the dry skate park, the skateboard speed is given as 789 centimeters per second (cm/s).

2. **Unit Conversion:**
   - To compare these speeds effectively, it's useful to ensure they are in the same unit. Let's convert the dry skate park speed from centimeters per second to meters per second.
   - We know that 1 meter = 100 centimeters.
   - Therefore, 789 cm/s = 789/100 m/s = 7.89 m/s.

3. **Comparison of Speeds:**
   - Wet skate park speed: 6 m/s
   - Dry skate park speed: 7.89 m/s

4. **Concept of Friction and Heat:**
   - Generally, the heat produced by an object is related to kinetic energy and friction. Higher speeds typically involve more kinetic energy and, consequently, could result in more friction and heat generation, assuming all other conditions (surface material, incline, mechanics) are similar.

5. **Reasoning:**
   - Since the skateboard is moving faster in the dry skate park at 7.89 m/s compared to the wet skate park 6 m/s, it is likely that more friction is generated in the dry skate park.
   - More friction results in more heat generation. Therefore, the skateboard would get hotter in the dry skate park due to the higher speed and increased friction.

### Conclusion:

Based on the comparison of speeds and the understanding of heat generation due to friction, the skateboard gets hotter in the dry skate park.

**Question:** Jed is trying to win a race against his friend Tyler. Jed weighs 340 kg, and Tyler weighs 80 kg. During the race, who will accelerate faster?
- **Option 1:** Jed
- **Option 2:** Tyler

## Solution:

To determine who will accelerate faster, we need to understand the relationship between mass and acceleration. According to Newton's second law of motion, acceleration \( a \) is inversely proportional to mass \( m \) when a constant force \( F \) is applied:

\[
a = \frac{F}{m}
\]

This implies that for the same amount of force, a person with lesser mass will accelerate faster than a person with greater mass. 

Given:

- Mass of Jed = 340 kg
- Mass of Tyler = 80 kg

The force applied is constant for both Jed and Tyler. Therefore, the acceleration of each person is inversely proportional to their mass.

**Comparison:**
- Jed, with a mass of 340 kg, will have a smaller acceleration.
- Tyler, with a mass of 80 kg, will have a larger acceleration.

**Conclusion:**
Since Tyler has significantly less mass compared to Jed, he will accelerate faster when the same force is applied to both.

Thus, during the race, Tyler will be able to increase his speed more quickly than Jed.

**Question:** Robin bought 6 identical cups for 144 Taka. But Lila bought 4 identical cups from another shop for 44 Taka. Determine if both shops charged the same price.

**Options:**
1. Did not charge the same price
2. Charged the same price

## Solution

To determine if the two shops charged the same price per cup, we need to calculate the unit price of a cup sold in each shop.

### Step 1: Calculate the price per cup for Robin

Robin bought 6 cups for a total of 144 Taka. Therefore, the cost per cup can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Price per cup for Robin} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of cups}} = \frac{144}{6} = 24 \text{ Taka}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the price per cup for Lila

Lila bought 4 cups for a total of 44 Taka. Therefore, the cost per cup can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Price per cup for Lila} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of cups}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ Taka}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the prices

- Price per cup for Robin: 24 Taka
- Price per cup for Lila: 11 Taka

Since 24 Taka per cup is not equal to 11 Taka per cup, the two shops did not charge the same price for the cups.

**Conclusion:** The shops did not charge the same price.

- Option 1: Jungle
- Option 2: Field

## Solution

Firstly, we need to calculate the coefficient of friction for both the jungle and the field:

1. **Coefficient of Friction in the Jungle:**

   Given: \( \mu_{\text{jungle}} = 0.7 \)

2. **Coefficient of Friction in the Field:**

   We are told that the coefficient of friction for the field is 10% of 1.2.

   \[
   \mu_{\text{field}} = 0.1 \times 1.2 = 0.12
   \]

The coefficient of friction \(\mu\) indicates how much resistance (friction) is encountered by a moving object on a surface. A lower coefficient of friction implies less resistance and thus potentially higher speed at which a vehicle can travel on the surface before slipping.

### Analysis:

- **Jungle (\(\mu_{\text{jungle}} = 0.7\)):** The coefficient of friction is relatively high, indicating that the jungle surface provides more resistance to motion.

- **Field (\(\mu_{\text{field}} = 0.12\)):** The coefficient of friction is significantly lower, indicating that the field offers much less resistance to motion.

Given a lower coefficient of friction, the car can move faster on the field compared to the jungle, as it encounters less resistance.

Hence, Mary's car moves faster on the field due to the lower coefficient of friction.

**Conclusion:**

Mary's car will move faster on the field compared to the jungle.

**Question (translated):** The weight of an F-16 is usually 567,214 pounds and the weight of a jumbo jet is 39,987 kilograms. Therefore, was the F-16?

**Option 1:** Slow-moving  
**Option 2:** Fast-moving  

## Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine whether the F-16 is ""slow-moving"" or ""fast-moving"" based on the given information about their weights, we need to consider what typically is a characteristic of an aircraft's speed relative to its weight.

1. **Convert Weights to a Common Unit:**
   - **F-16 Weight:** 567,214 pounds.
   - We convert the weight of the jumbo jet from kilograms to pounds for comparison:
     - \( 1 \text{ kilogram} = 2.20462 \text{ pounds} \)
     - \( 39,987 \text{ kilograms} \times 2.20462 = 88,191.58 \text{ pounds (approx)} \)

2. **Compare the Two Weights:**
   - **F-16:** 567,214 pounds
   - **Jumbo Jet:** 88,191.58 pounds

3. **Analyze the Implications on Speed:**
   - Generally, an F-16 is a type of fighter jet designed for high speed and agility. These jets are usually lighter compared to commercial aircraft such as jumbo jets, which carry passengers and cargo, and are not designed for speed.
   - Despite the higher weight mentioned here for an F-16, the focus should be on the functionality of the aircraft:
     - Fighter jets like the F-16 are typically faster due to their design and purpose, which is to achieve high speeds and rapid maneuvers in combat.

4. **Conclusion Based on Functionality and Typical Characteristics:**
   - An F-16, even with the given weight, is still expected to be fast-moving since it is known to be a military aircraft with a design focus on speed.
   - The weight comparison alone does not directly impact the characteristic which is about the speed potential of an F-16.

Given the typical role and design of the F-16 aircraft, the correct conclusion is that it is ""fast-moving.""

### Question:
Lisa was playing with two model rockets. If she launches both rockets into the sky at the same time, after 30 seconds, the black one is 30 meters above the ground and the red one is 18 meters above the ground. Which one was faster?

### Options:
- **Option 1**: The red one.
- **Option 2**: The black one.

## Solution:
To determine which rocket was faster, we need to compare their velocities. Velocity is defined as the distance covered per unit of time.

1. **Information Given**:
   - In 30 seconds, the black rocket reaches 30 meters above the ground.
   - In 30 seconds, the red rocket reaches 18 meters above the ground.

2. **Calculate Velocities**:
   - For the black rocket, the distance covered is 30 meters in 30 seconds.
     \[
     \text{Velocity of black rocket} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{30 \text{ meters}}{30 \text{ seconds}} = 1 \text{ meter/second}
     \]
   - For the red rocket, the distance covered is 18 meters in 30 seconds.
     \[
     \text{Velocity of red rocket} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{18 \text{ meters}}{30 \text{ seconds}} = 0.6 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

3. **Compare Velocities**:
   - The black rocket has a velocity of 1 meter/second.
   - The red rocket has a velocity of 0.6 meters/second.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since 1 meter/second (black rocket) is greater than 0.6 meters/second (red rocket), the black rocket is faster.

### Question:
If both a car and a pickup travel at 60 miles per hour, but the car stops after 6.1 hours whereas the pickup stops after 1.9 hours, which one covers a shorter distance?

### Options:
- Option 1: Car
- Option 2: Pickup

## Step 2: Solve the Problem

To determine which vehicle covers a shorter distance, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle travels using the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

### Calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- Speed of the car = 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the car = 6.1 hours

\[ \text{Distance covered by car} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6.1 \, \text{hours} = 366 \, \text{miles} \]

### Calculate the distance traveled by the pickup:
- Speed of the pickup = 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the pickup = 1.9 hours

\[ \text{Distance covered by pickup} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.9 \, \text{hours} = 114 \, \text{miles} \]

## Step 3: Compare Distances
Now we compare the distances:
- Distance covered by the car = 366 miles
- Distance covered by the pickup = 114 miles

Clearly, the pickup covers a shorter distance than the car.

## Conclusion:
The vehicle that covers a shorter distance is the pickup.

**Question:**
Mohsin and Maryam decide to ride their bikes around a park. They follow the same route, but Mohsin rides his bike at a speed of 2 miles/hour, and Maryam rides at a speed of 1.2 miles/hour. Who will have covered less distance after ten minutes?

**Option 1:** Mohsin  
**Option 2:** Maryam  

## Solution:

To determine who covers less distance, we need to calculate the distance each person travels in ten minutes.

### Step 1: Convert time from minutes to hours
Ten minutes is equal to \(\frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6}\) hours because there are 60 minutes in an hour.

### Step 2: Calculate Mohsin's distance
Mohsin's speed is 2 miles per hour. The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
Therefore, the distance Mohsin travels in \(\frac{1}{6}\) hours is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Mohsin}} = 2 \, \text{miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{6} \, \text{hour} = \frac{2}{6} \, \text{miles} = \frac{1}{3} \, \text{mile} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Maryam's distance
Maryam's speed is 1.2 miles per hour. Using the same formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Maryam}} = 1.2 \, \text{miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{6} \, \text{hour} = \frac{1.2}{6} \, \text{miles} = 0.2 \, \text{mile} \]

### Conclusion
After ten minutes, Mohsin has traveled \(\frac{1}{3}\) mile, and Maryam has traveled 0.2 miles. Since \(\frac{1}{3}\) is approximately 0.333, and 0.2 is less than 0.333, Maryam covers less distance than Mohsin.

**Question:**
Sherry rolls her ball under two lanes. The ball covers the red lane in 15 seconds, but covers the green lane in 20 seconds. Both lanes have the same length. Is the ball slower in the green lane because of:
- Option 1: More friction
- Option 2: Less friction

### Detailed Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of friction and how it affects the movement of objects.

1. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - Both the red and the green lanes are of the same length.
   - The time taken to cover the red lane is 15 seconds.
   - The time taken to cover the green lane is 20 seconds.

2. **Concept of Friction:**
   - Friction is a force that resists the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.
   - More friction means that there is a greater resistance to motion, causing objects to move slower.
   - Less friction means less resistance, allowing objects to move faster.

3. **Analyzing the Time Difference:**
   - Since the ball takes longer (20 seconds) to cover the green lane compared to the red lane (15 seconds), it implies that the ball is moving slower in the green lane.
   - A slower movement in the green lane suggests that there is more resistance to its motion compared to the red lane.

4. **Conclusion Based on Friction:**
   - The increased time taken on the green lane can be attributed to higher resistance, which is generally due to more friction.
   - Therefore, the ball moves slower in the green lane due to increased friction.

Hence, the correct choice in these circumstances would be that the ball is slower in the green lane because of **more friction**.

### Question:
Jim could run at a speed of 46 cm/second, and his sister Jane could run at a speed of 20 m/second. To stop the spread of a deadly virus, they had to deliver some urgent vaccines to the next town. Who should take the vaccines to reach there in a shorter time?

### Options:
- Option 1: Jim
- Option 2: Jane

## Solution

We need to determine who runs faster to decide who should deliver the vaccines. For this, we must compare their speeds. However, their speeds are given in different units (Jim's speed in centimeters per second and Jane's speed in meters per second), so we need to convert Jim's speed to the same unit as Jane's for accurate comparison.

1. **Convert Jim's speed to meters per second:**

   Jim's speed is given as 46 cm/second. To convert centimeters to meters, we use the conversion factor:
   \[
   1 \text{ meter} = 100 \text{ centimeters}
   \]

   Converting 46 cm/second to m/second:
   \[
   46 \text{ cm/second} = \frac{46}{100} \text{ m/second} = 0.46 \text{ m/second}
   \]

2. **Compare their speeds:**

   - Jim's speed: 0.46 m/second
   - Jane's speed: 20 m/second

   Clearly, 20 m/second (Jane's speed) is much greater than 0.46 m/second (Jim's speed). Therefore, Jane is significantly faster than Jim.

3. **Determine who should deliver the vaccines:**

   Since Jane is much faster than Jim, she will reach the next town in a shorter time. Hence, Jane should take the vaccines to ensure she gets there quickly.

**Question:**  
A cheetah runs at a speed of 45 km/h and a dog runs at a speed of 2 km/h. Therefore, how much time will the cheetah take?

**Option 1:** Less time  
**Option 2:** More time

## Solution:

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two animals: a cheetah and a dog.
   - The cheetah's speed = 45 km/h.
   - The dog's speed = 2 km/h.
   - We need to determine how much time the cheetah will take, in relation to the dog, to cover the same distance.

2. **Conceptual Insight:**
   - Time taken to cover a certain distance is inversely proportional to speed if the distance is fixed. This means the faster the speed, the less time it takes to cover the same distance.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Given the cheetah’s speed (45 km/h) is much higher than the dog's speed (2 km/h), the cheetah will cover any given distance much faster.
   - Thus, the cheetah will take less time compared to the dog for the same distance.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the comparison of their speeds and the concept of time being inversely proportional to speed (for a constant distance), it is clear that the cheetah will take **less time** than the dog.

Thus, the correct option is **""Less time""**.

**Question:** 
The first turtle travels 400 cm in one second, and the second turtle travels 2 meters in 5 seconds. Which one will take more time to reach the sea if both turtles walk towards the sea?

- **Option 1:** The first turtle
- **Option 2:** The second turtle

### Step-by-Step Solution:

To determine which turtle will take more time to reach the sea, we need to compare their speeds.

1. **Convert all distances to the same unit:**
   - The first turtle travels 400 cm in one second.
   - The second turtle travels 2 meters in 5 seconds. 
   - Since 1 meter = 100 cm, 2 meters = 200 cm.

2. **Calculate the speed of each turtle:**
   
   - **First Turtle Speed:**
     - Distance = 400 cm
     - Time = 1 second
     - Speed = Distance / Time = 400 cm/second

   - **Second Turtle Speed:**
     - Distance = 200 cm
     - Time = 5 seconds
     - Speed = Distance / Time = 200 cm / 5 seconds = 40 cm/second

3. **Compare the speeds:**
   - The first turtle moves at 400 cm/second.
   - The second turtle moves at 40 cm/second.

4. **Determine which one takes more time:**
   - The turtle that moves slower will take more time to reach the sea.
   - Since 40 cm/second (second turtle) is slower than 400 cm/second (first turtle), the second turtle will take more time to reach the sea.

### Conclusion:

The second turtle will take more time to reach the sea.
