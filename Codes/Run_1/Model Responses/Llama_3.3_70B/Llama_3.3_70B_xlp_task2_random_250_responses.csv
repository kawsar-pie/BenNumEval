1. **Translation of the Problem**: The problem in Bengali translates to English as ""What is the molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine?""

2. **Solution**: 
   - The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19 grams/mole, since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, its molecular formula is F₂.
   - The molecular mass of F₂ is 2 * atomic mass of F = 2 * 19 = 38 grams/mole.
   - The question asks for the molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine. Since the molecular weight of 1 mole of fluorine (F₂) is 38 grams, the molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine (F₂) would be 19 * molecular weight of 1 mole of F₂ = 19 * 38.

3. **Calculation**: 
   - Molecular weight of 19 moles of F₂ = 19 * 38 = 722 grams.

""Translate the Bengali problem into English: 
A circle with a diameter of 2 cm has an arc of 8 cm in length. What is the central angle in radians subtended by this arc at the center of the circle?""

Now, to solve the problem:

The formula to find the central angle (θ) in radians is given by:

θ = s / r

where s is the length of the arc and r is the radius of the circle.

Given that the diameter of the circle is 2 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 1 cm.

The length of the arc (s) is given as 8 cm.

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

θ = s / r
= 8 / 1
= 8 radians

However, considering the context of the problem and the usual expectations for such calculations, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the direct application of the given values. The length of the arc (8 cm) seems unusually large for a circle with a diameter of 2 cm (and thus a radius of 1 cm), as the circumference of such a circle would be 2 * π * r = 2 * π * 1 ≈ 6.28 cm, which is less than the arc length given.

For a circle with a radius of 1 cm, the maximum length of an arc would be the circumference of the circle itself, which is approximately 6.28 cm. An arc of 8 cm would imply a circle larger than described or an error in the problem statement as given.

Given the formula and normal expectations, if we were to correct the understanding of the problem to fit within realistic parameters (assuming a typo or misunderstanding in the problem statement), we would typically expect the arc length to be a fraction of the circle's circumference, not exceeding it. However, proceeding with the calculation as per the formula provided and the values given (despite the apparent inconsistency), the direct calculation yields the result as per the formula.

""Translate the Bengali problem into English: 
The diameter of a circle is 5 cm. What is the amount of the central angle of the 15 cm long arc in the circle in radians?""

Now, let's solve the problem. 

The formula to find the central angle (θ) in radians is given by:
θ = (arc length) / (radius of the circle)

Given the diameter of the circle is 5 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 5 / 2 = 2.5 cm.

The arc length is given as 15 cm.

Now, we can calculate the central angle in radians:
θ = (15 cm) / (2.5 cm) = 6 radians

Therefore, the central angle of the 15 cm long arc in the circle is 6 radians.

**Translation:** In the case of tossing two coins, what is the probability of getting at least one head?

Now, let's analyze the possible outcomes when tossing two coins. Each coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). So, for two coins, the total possible outcomes are 2 * 2 = 4, which are:

1. HH (Head, Head)
2. HT (Head, Tail)
3. TH (Tail, Head)
4. TT (Tail, Tail)

Out of these outcomes, the scenarios where we get at least one head are:

- HH (both heads)
- HT (one head, one tail)
- TH (one tail, one head)

So, 3 out of the 4 possible outcomes result in at least one head.

**Calculation:** The probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the favorable outcomes (getting at least one head) are 3, and the total outcomes are 4.

""From a stationary position, a train is moving with uniform acceleration at 2 m/s^2. What speed will it attain when it crosses a post located 250 meters away?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We are given the acceleration of the train, which is 2 m/s^2.
2. We are also given the distance to the post, which is 250 meters.
3. Since the train starts from rest, its initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s.
4. We can use the equation of motion to find the final velocity (v) of the train when it crosses the post: v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance.

1. **Translation of the problem:** A freely falling object covers 72 meters in 6 seconds. How much distance will it cover in 3 seconds?

2. **Understanding the concept:** When an object falls freely, its acceleration is due to gravity, which is approximately 9.81 m/s^2 on Earth. However, for this problem, we don't need to calculate the acceleration because we can use the formula for the distance covered by a freely falling object, which is s = (1/2)gt^2, where s is the distance, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time. 

3. **Given values:** The object covers 72 meters in 6 seconds. So, we have s = 72 m and t = 6 s.

4. **Calculating the distance for 3 seconds:** 
Since the distance covered is proportional to the square of the time (because s = (1/2)gt^2), we can set up a proportion or directly calculate using the formula. However, to avoid calculations involving g, we can utilize the proportionality directly.

Given that in 6 seconds, the object covers 72 meters, we find the distance covered in 3 seconds by using the square of the ratio of times because distance is proportional to the square of time in free fall:

Distance in 3 seconds = 72 * (3/6)^2
Distance in 3 seconds = 72 * (1/2)^2
Distance in 3 seconds = 72 * 1/4
Distance in 3 seconds = 18 meters

Therefore, the object will cover 18 meters in 3 seconds.

February 2000 had 29 days since 2000 was a leap year.

The problem states that it rained for 5 days, but it does not specify which days. To calculate the probability of it raining on February 12, we need to consider all possible combinations of 5 rainy days out of the 29 days in February.

The total number of ways to choose 5 days out of 29 is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of days (29) and r is the number of rainy days (5).

So, the total number of combinations is C(29, 5).

However, the question seems to ask for a simpler probability based on the information given, which might be interpreted as what fraction of the month experienced rain, assuming each day has an equal chance of being one of the rainy days. 

Given that interpretation, the probability that February 12 was one of those rainy days can be simplified to the number of rainy days divided by the total number of days in February, since each day has an equal chance of being selected as a rainy day.

Therefore, the probability is 5 rainy days out of 29 total days, which is 5/29.

The problem essentially asks how the velocity of an object changes when the distance it falls is quadrupled, assuming it starts from rest and falls freely under gravity without any air resistance.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem in English translates to: ""If an object is released from a fixed position without any obstruction, how many times will its velocity increase when the distance is quadrupled?""

2. **Solution:**
When an object falls freely under gravity, its velocity increases as it covers more distance due to the acceleration caused by gravity. The key equation to understand here is the relationship between the velocity (v) of an object, the acceleration due to gravity (g), and the distance (s) it falls:
\[ v^2 = 2gs \]

This equation shows that the square of the velocity is directly proportional to the distance fallen. If the distance is quadrupled, the new distance (s') is 4s.

Let's denote the original velocity as v and the new velocity as v'. According to the equation:
\[ v^2 = 2gs \]
\[ v'^2 = 2g(4s) \]
\[ v'^2 = 8(2gs) \]
\[ v'^2 = 8v^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides to solve for v':
\[ v' = \sqrt{8}v \]
\[ v' = 2\sqrt{2}v \]

This means the velocity increases by a factor of \(2\sqrt{2}\) when the distance is quadrupled.

- The circumference \(C\) of the wheel can be calculated using the formula \(C = \pi \times d\), where \(d\) is the diameter of the wheel.
- Given \(d = 0.8\) meters, \(C = \pi \times 0.8\).
- \(C = 3.14159 \times 0.8 \approx 2.512\) meters.
- The wheel rotates 6 times per second, so the distance covered in one second is \(2.512 \times 6 \approx 15.072\) meters.
- To find the speed in kilometers per hour, we need to convert the distance covered in one second into kilometers per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour.
- Speed in meters per second is \(15.072\) meters/second.
- Speed in meters per hour is \(15.072 \times 3600 \approx 54259.2\) meters/hour.
- To convert meters/hour to kilometers/hour, divide by 1000 (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters).

""An 6 cm radius metal solid sphere is melted to form a cylinder of 32 cm height. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?""

Now, let's solve the problem:

The volume of the sphere (V) is given by the formula: V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.
Given that the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can calculate its volume as:
V = (4/3)π(6)³ = (4/3)π(216) = 288π cubic cm.

When the sphere is melted to form a cylinder, the volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere. The volume of a cylinder (V) is given by the formula: V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder.

We can equate the two volumes:
288π = πr²(32)
Now, simplify the equation:
288 = 32r²
r² = 288/32
r² = 9
r = √9 = 3 cm

Now that we have the radius of the cylinder, we can find its curved surface area. The curved surface area of a cylinder (A) is given by the formula: A = 2πrh, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder.

Substitute the values:
A = 2π(3)(32)
A = 192π
Approximating π as 3.14159:

The Vernier scale is a secondary scale that slides along the main scale, and it is used to measure smaller distances or lengths.

Given:
- 10 divisions on the Vernier scale = 9 divisions on the main scale.

Let's denote the length of one division on the main scale as 'x' cm. Then, the length of 9 divisions on the main scale would be 9x cm.

Since 10 divisions on the Vernier scale are equal to 9 divisions on the main scale, we can say that 10 divisions on the Vernier scale also equal 9x cm.

The Vernier constant is the length of one division on the Vernier scale. If we denote the Vernier constant as 'V', then:
10V = 9x

To find the Vernier constant (V), we need to know the value of 'x'. However, the problem does not directly provide 'x', but it asks for the Vernier constant in terms of cm, implying we should express it in relation to 'x' or find a specific value if 'x' is implicitly given as 1 cm (which is a common assumption unless stated otherwise).

Given the information provided, we assume the main scale division (x) is 1 cm for a straightforward calculation, as specific values for 'x' are not given.

So, if x = 1 cm (for simplicity and assuming standard scale divisions):

   - The molar mass of H₂SO₄ can be calculated as follows:
     - Hydrogen (H) has a molar mass of approximately 1 g/mol. Since there are two hydrogen atoms, their total mass is 2 * 1 = 2 g/mol.
     - Sulfur (S) has a molar mass of approximately 32 g/mol.

where C1 and C2 are the circumferences of the larger and smaller wheels, respectively.

Substituting the formula for circumference, we get:

2πr1 - 2πr2 = 120 cm

where r1 and r2 are the radii of the larger and smaller wheels, respectively.

Factoring out 2π, we get:

2π(r1 - r2) = 120 cm

Now, to find the difference in radii (r1 - r2), we divide both sides by 2π:

r1 - r2 = 120 cm / (2π)

Using the value of π as approximately 3.14159, we calculate:

r1 - r2 = 120 cm / (2 * 3.14159)
r1 - r2 ≈ 120 cm / 6.28318
r1 - r2 ≈ 19.1 cm

Therefore, the difference in radii of the two wheels is approximately 19.1 cm.

In the binary number system, each digit (or bit) can be either 0 or 1. 

However, the problem doesn't explicitly state the number of toys in Lincoln's box or the total number of boxes his siblings have. But since it mentions ""বাইনারি সংখ্যা পদ্ধতিতে প্রতিটি সংখ্যার প্রতিনিধিত্বকারী খেলনা"", which translates to ""toys representing each number in the binary number system"", we can assume it's referring to the basic representation of binary digits, which would be 2 toys (0 and 1) for Lincoln.

Given that Lincoln's siblings have 6 more boxes and assuming each box also contains toys representing binary digits (0 and 1), each box would have 2 toys.

Now, calculating the total number of toys:
- Lincoln's box: 2 toys
- Siblings' boxes: 6 boxes * 2 toys per box = 12 toys

Total toys = Lincoln's toys + Siblings' toys = 2 + 12 = 14 toys

The reaction is as follows:

CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) → CaO (calcium oxide) + CO2 (carbon dioxide)

The molar mass of CaCO3 is approximately 100 g/mol, and the molar mass of CaO is approximately 56 g/mol.

Given that we have 200 grams of CaCO3, we can calculate the number of moles of CaCO3:

moles = mass / molar mass = 200 g / 100 g/mol = 2 mol

Since the reaction is 1:1 for CaCO3 to CaO, 2 moles of CaCO3 will produce 2 moles of CaO.

Now, we calculate the mass of CaO produced:

mass of CaO = moles * molar mass of CaO = 2 mol * 56 g/mol = 112 g

Therefore, when 200 grams of limestone is heated in an open container, 112 grams of calcium oxide will be produced.

""An object with a mass of 8 kg placed on a surface, when subjected to a force of 30 Newtons, gains an acceleration of 3 m/s^2. What is the frictional force between the object and the surface?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Given:
- Mass of the object (m) = 8 kg
- Applied force (F) = 30 N
- Acceleration (a) = 3 m/s^2

We know that the net force acting on the object is given by Newton's second law of motion: F_net = m * a.

Since the object is gaining acceleration, the net force acting on it is the difference between the applied force and the frictional force (f). So, we can write:

F_net = F - f
m * a = F - f

Substituting the given values:
8 * 3 = 30 - f
24 = 30 - f
f = 30 - 24
f = 6 N

Therefore, the frictional force between the object and the surface is 6 N.

""Translation: What is the central angle subtended by a 15 cm long arc of a circle with a diameter of 9 cm?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step. 

The formula to find the central angle (θ) subtended by an arc is given by:

θ = (arc length / radius) * (180 / π)

Given that the diameter of the circle is 9 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is:

r = 9 / 2 = 4.5 cm

The arc length is given as 15 cm. 

Plugging in the values into the formula, we get:

θ = (15 / 4.5) * (180 / π)
θ = (10/3) * (180 / π)
θ = (10/3) * (180 / 3.14159)
θ = (10/3) * 57.2958
θ ≈ 190.99

However, this angle is in degrees. To find the answer in the context of the question which seems to be looking for an angle in degrees but may be interpreted differently, we should directly use the relationship of the arc length to the circumference and the central angle to 360 degrees.

The circumference of the circle is π * diameter = π * 9 cm. 

The fraction of the circumference represented by the 15 cm arc is 15 / (π * 9).

This fraction of the circumference corresponds to the same fraction of the total 360 degrees in a circle. 

So, the central angle θ = (15 / (π * 9)) * 360.

Calculating θ:
θ = (15 / (3.14159 * 9)) * 360
θ = (15 / 28.2743) * 360
θ ≈ 0.5317 * 360
θ ≈ 191.412

However, recognizing that the precise calculation directly from the relationship of arc length to the central angle should directly apply, let's correct the approach considering the request for the final answer format and re-evaluate with proper rounding if necessary.

The correct calculation directly using the relationship should consider the proportion of the arc to the whole circle's circumference and how that proportion relates to 360 degrees.

Relative frequency is the ratio of the number of times an event occurs to the total number of trials. In this case, the event is getting heads when a coin is flipped.

1. **Translation of the problem:** A coin is tossed 750 times, and it comes up heads 300 times. What is the relative frequency of getting heads?

2. **Solution:** 
   - Total number of trials (tosses) = 750
   - Number of times heads comes up = 300
   - Relative frequency of getting heads = (Number of times heads comes up) / (Total number of trials)
   - Relative frequency = 300 / 750
   - To simplify, we find the greatest common divisor of 300 and 750, which is 150.
   - Relative frequency = (300 / 150) / (750 / 150) = 2 / 5
   - To express this as a decimal or percentage, we can convert 2/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 2 / 5 = 0.4
   - To express it as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.4 * 100 = 40%

This principle states that a change in pressure at any point in a confined fluid is undiminished throughout the fluid and results in an equal change in pressure on every point of the container or on anything contacted by the fluid.

Given:
- Area of the smaller piston (A1) = 5 square cm
- Area of the larger piston (A2) = 25 square cm
- Force applied to the smaller piston (F1) = 100 Newtons

We are asked to find the force (F2) that will be exerted on the larger piston.

According to Pascal's principle, the pressure (P) applied to the fluid is the same throughout. Pressure is defined as force per unit area (P = F/A). Since the pressure is the same in both pistons, we can set up the equation as follows:

P1 = P2

Given that P = F/A, we substitute the areas and forces:

F1 / A1 = F2 / A2

Substituting the given values:

100 / 5 = F2 / 25

20 = F2 / 25

To find F2, we multiply both sides by 25:

F2 = 20 * 25

1. Translation of the problem: 
""A wheel makes 35 revolutions to cover a 250-meter path on a circular track. What is the radius of the wheel in meters?""

2. Solution:
The distance covered by the wheel in one revolution is equal to the circumference of the wheel. Since the wheel makes 35 revolutions to cover 250 meters, we can set up the equation:
   Circumference of the wheel * Number of revolutions = Total distance covered
   2 * π * r * 35 = 250
 
Here, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the wheel. 
Rearranging the equation to solve for r:
   2 * π * r = 250 / 35
   2 * 3.14159 * r = 250 / 35
   6.28318 * r = 7.14286
   r = 7.14286 / 6.28318
   r ≈ 1.136

However, the provided calculation seems incorrect as it doesn't follow the precise mathematical steps for solving the given problem. Let's correct that and follow the proper steps:

Given that the wheel covers 250 meters in 35 revolutions, we can find the circumference of the wheel (which is the distance it covers in one revolution) by dividing the total distance by the number of revolutions:
   Circumference = Total distance / Number of revolutions
   Circumference = 250 meters / 35
   Circumference = 7.14286 meters

The formula for the circumference of a circle (which is the wheel in this case) is:
   Circumference = 2 * π * r

Using the calculated circumference, we can find the radius:
   7.14286 = 2 * π * r
   7.14286 = 2 * 3.14159 * r
   7.14286 = 6.28318 * r
   r = 7.14286 / 6.28318

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the force exerted by the woman on the ground when she stands on one foot. Since her weight is 40 kg, the force (F) due to gravity is given by F = m * g, where m is the mass (40 kg) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2).

F = 40 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 392 N

2. Since the woman is standing on one foot, the force exerted on that foot is the same as her total weight, which is 392 N.

3. The area of the sole of her shoe is given as 200 square centimeters. To convert this into square meters (since the standard unit for pressure is Pascals, which is Newtons per square meter), we divide by 10,000 (since 1 m^2 = 10,000 cm^2).

Area = 200 cm^2 / 10,000 = 0.02 m^2

4. Pressure (P) is calculated as force (F) divided by area (A). So, the pressure when the woman stands on one foot is:

H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of hydrogen gas reacts with 1 mole of chlorine gas to produce 2 moles of hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Given:
- Mass of hydrogen gas = 5 grams
- Mass of chlorine gas = 75 grams

First, we need to find the number of moles of each gas. The molar mass of H2 is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of Cl2 is approximately 71 grams/mole.

Number of moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molar mass of H2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 moles
Number of moles of Cl2 = mass of Cl2 / molar mass of Cl2 = 75 / 71 ≈ 1.06 moles

Since the reaction requires a 1:1 ratio of H2 to Cl2, the limiting reactant (the reactant that will be completely consumed first) is Cl2, because there are fewer moles of Cl2 (1.06 moles) compared to H2 (2.5 moles).

After the reaction is complete, all of the Cl2 will have reacted with an equal amount of H2, leaving excess H2. The amount of H2 that reacts is equal to the number of moles of Cl2, which is 1.06 moles.

The gravitational acceleration \(g\) at the surface of the Earth is given by \(g = G \frac{M}{R^2}\), where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass of the Earth, and \(R\) is the radius of the Earth. However, at different heights above the Earth's surface, the gravitational acceleration can be approximated by \(g = G \frac{M}{(R + h)^2}\), where \(h\) is the height above the Earth's surface.

Given that the gravitational acceleration at the top of the mountain is 9.77 m/s^2, we can compare it with the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface, which is approximately 9.81 m/s^2. The difference in gravitational acceleration is due to the change in distance from the center of the Earth.

Let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The value of gravitational acceleration at the peak of a mountain is 9.77 m/s^2. What is the height of the mountain in meters?""

The formula to find the height \(h\) can be derived from the relationship of gravitational acceleration at different heights:
\[g_{surface} - g_{height} = \frac{2GMMh}{R^3}\] simplifies to \[g_{surface} - g_{height} = \frac{2gh}{R}\], considering \(g = \frac{GM}{R^2}\) and neglecting higher-order terms for small \(h\).

Rearranging for \(h\), we get:

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to convert the initial speed from km/h to m/s:
54 km/h = 54 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 15 m/s

2. The distance traveled by the car before stopping is the distance from the initial position to the point where the pedestrian is, minus the 1 meter in front of the pedestrian where the car stopped:
Distance = 46 m - 1 m = 45 m

3. We can use the equation of motion to find the acceleration of the car:
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
where v is the final velocity (0 m/s, since the car stops), u is the initial velocity (15 m/s), a is the acceleration, and s is the distance traveled (45 m).

Rearranging the equation to solve for a:
a = (v^2 - u^2) / 2s
= (0^2 - 15^2) / (2 * 45)

The binary number system represents numbers using only two digits: 0 and 1. For the toys to represent each number in the binary system, we start counting from 0 (which is also part of the binary system) up to a certain number that can be represented by the toys available.

However, the problem states that there are toys representing ""প্রতিটি সংখ্যা"" (each number) in the binary system for Lincoln and adds that his siblings have 11 more boxes of toys. This implies we need to figure out how many numbers (and thus toys) are in Lincoln's box and then add the additional 11 boxes his siblings have.

Since binary numbers start from 0, let's consider the first few binary numbers:
- 0 (which is 0 in decimal)
- 1 (which is 1 in decimal)
- 10 (which is 2 in decimal)
- 11 (which is 3 in decimal)
- 100 (which is 4 in decimal)
- And so on.

The problem doesn't specify up to which number the toys represent. However, for the sake of understanding, let's assume Lincoln's box contains toys representing binary numbers up to a certain point. If Lincoln has a toy for each binary number up to, say, 2^3 - 1 (since 2^3 = 8, which can be represented by 3 binary digits: 000 to 111, giving us 8 numbers including 0), that would be 8 toys (for 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111 in binary, which correspond to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in decimal).

However, this interpretation seems too narrow given the information about the siblings having more boxes. The question's phrasing suggests that each box might contain a set of toys representing all possible binary numbers up to a certain length (like all combinations of 3-digit binary numbers, which is 2^3 = 8 combinations including 000).

Translation: If the length of the diagonal of a square is 5√2 cm, then what is its area in square centimeters?

Given that the diagonal (d) of the square is 5√2 cm, we can use the formula for the diagonal of a square, which is d = √2 * side. Here, the side of the square is 's'. So, we have:

d = √2 * s
5√2 = √2 * s

To find 's', we can divide both sides by √2:
s = 5√2 / √2
s = 5

Now that we know the side of the square is 5 cm, we can calculate its area (A) using the formula A = side^2:
A = 5^2
A = 25

Therefore, the area of the square is 25 square centimeters.

The reaction between sodium (Na) and oxygen (O2) to form sodium oxide (Na2O) is:

4Na + O2 → 2Na2O

From the given information:
- Mass of oxygen (O2) = 64 grams
- Mass of sodium (Na) = 46 grams

First, let's calculate the molar masses of the substances involved:
- Molar mass of O2 = 32 g/mol (since oxygen has a molar mass of 16 g/mol, and there are two atoms in a molecule of O2)
- Molar mass of Na = 23 g/mol
- Molar mass of Na2O = 62 g/mol (since sodium oxide is composed of two sodium atoms and one oxygen atom)

Now, let's find out how many moles of oxygen and sodium we have:
- Moles of O2 = mass of O2 / molar mass of O2 = 64 g / 32 g/mol = 2 mol
- Moles of Na = mass of Na / molar mass of Na = 46 g / 23 g/mol = 2 mol

From the chemical equation, we see that 4 moles of Na react with 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of Na2O. Given that we have 2 moles of Na, which is half of what is required to react with 1 mole of O2, we can determine that the reaction is limited by the amount of sodium available.

Since 4 moles of Na are required to react with 1 mole of O2, and we only have 2 moles of Na, we need half a mole of O2 to react with the 2 moles of Na. 

Thus, the amount of O2 that reacts = 0.5 mol

The mass of O2 that reacts = 0.5 mol * 32 g/mol = 16 g

So, the amount of oxygen left = initial mass of O2 - mass of O2 that reacts
= 64 g - 16 g
= 48 g

Therefore, the amount of oxygen left after the reaction is 48 grams.

1. **Translation of the problem into English:** ""When an object tied with a string is rotated once in a vertical plane, what is the amount of work done in joules?""

2. **Conceptual Understanding:** Work done (W) is calculated using the formula W = F * d * cos(θ), where F is the force applied, d is the distance over which the force is applied, and θ is the angle between the force and the direction of the displacement. However, for an object being rotated in a vertical plane, if we consider the force to be the tension in the string and the distance as the circumference of the circle traced by the object, the calculation is different. Essentially, for a single rotation, if no external force is applied other than the gravitational force (and assuming the string's tension does not contribute to work done due to its direction being perpendicular to the displacement at all points), the work done simplifies significantly.

3. **Analysis:** The object tied with a string and rotated in a vertical plane will experience centrifugal force due to its rotation and gravitational force due to its mass. However, the work done by these forces during a single rotation is not straightforward without knowing the specific conditions (like radius of rotation, mass of the object, etc.). But typically, for such a scenario where an object completes one rotation without any specified external force doing work on it, we consider the energy expenditure in terms of rotational kinetic energy or potential energy changes due to gravity, if any.

4. **Clarification and Simplification:** Without specific details on the mass of the object, the radius of the rotation, or any change in height, calculating the exact work done in joules directly from the given statement is challenging. Typically, the work done in lifting an object or in rotational motion can depend on various factors such as the mass of the object, the radius of rotation, and the gravitational acceleration if there's a change in height.

5. **Simplified Scenario Interpretation:** If the question implies a basic understanding scenario where the rotation does not involve a change in potential energy (i.e., the object returns to its original height after the rotation), and without additional forces doing work on the system, the problem might be testing the understanding of work done in a conservative force field or the concept of work in rotational motion without explicit details.

The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16.00 g/mol, and the atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1.01 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of Al(OH)₃ = 26.98 (for Al) + 3*16.00 (for 3 O) + 3*1.01 (for 3 H) = 26.98 + 48.00 + 3.03 = 78.01 g/mol.

The reaction between carbon (in the form of coke, which is essentially pure carbon) and oxygen to produce carbon dioxide can be represented by the following equation:

C + O2 → CO2

From the equation, it is clear that 1 mole of carbon reacts with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 1 mole of carbon dioxide.

The molar masses of carbon (C), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) are approximately 12 g/mol, 32 g/mol, and 44 g/mol, respectively.

Given:
- Mass of carbon (coke) = 5 g
- Mass of oxygen (O2) = 5 g

First, let's convert the given masses into moles to understand the limiting reagent:

Moles of carbon = mass of carbon / molar mass of carbon = 5 g / 12 g/mol ≈ 0.4167 mol
Moles of oxygen = mass of oxygen / molar mass of oxygen = 5 g / 32 g/mol ≈ 0.15625 mol

Since the reaction requires 1 mole of oxygen for every 1 mole of carbon, and we have less moles of oxygen than carbon, oxygen is the limiting reagent here.

The reaction will consume all the oxygen (0.15625 mol) and an equal amount of carbon (0.15625 mol) to produce carbon dioxide.

Mass of carbon consumed = moles of carbon consumed * molar mass of carbon = 0.15625 mol * 12 g/mol ≈ 1.875 g

Therefore, the mass of carbon (coke) left over after the reaction is:

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a 0.125 molar solution of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is prepared in 1000 milliliters (mL) of solution. We need to find out how many grams of potassium carbonate are in the solution.

2. **Understanding the Concepts:**
- Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The formula for molarity is M = moles of solute / liters of solution.
- The molar mass of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) can be calculated by summing the atomic masses of its constituent atoms: potassium (K), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). The atomic masses are approximately K = 39.1 g/mol, C = 12.0 g/mol, and O = 16.0 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of K2CO3 = (2 * 39.1) + 12.0 + (3 * 16.0) = 78.2 + 12.0 + 48.0 = 138.2 g/mol.

3. **Calculating the Number of Moles of K2CO3:**
Given that the solution is 0.125 molar and we have 1000 mL (or 1 liter, since 1000 mL = 1 L) of the solution, the number of moles of K2CO3 can be found directly from the definition of molarity. Since M = moles of solute / liters of solution, rearranging for moles of solute gives: moles of solute = M * liters of solution = 0.125 M * 1 L = 0.125 moles.

4. **Calculating the Mass of K2CO3:**
To find the mass of K2CO3 in grams, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass of K2CO3: mass = moles * molar mass = 0.125 moles * 138.2 g/mol.

5. **Final Calculation:**

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH.

1. **Translation of the problem into English for clarity:**
   - 200 ml of 0.5 molar sulfuric acid solution is prepared. How much sodium hydroxide will remain in the solution when 10 grams of sodium hydroxide are added to it?

2. **Calculating the number of moles of sulfuric acid:**
   - Molarity (M) = moles of solute / liters of solution
   - Given M = 0.5 M, and the volume of the solution = 200 ml = 0.2 liters
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = M * volume (in liters) = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles

3. **Calculating the number of moles of sodium hydroxide added:**
   - Molecular weight of NaOH = 40 g/mol
   - Mass of NaOH added = 10 g
   - Moles of NaOH added = mass of NaOH / molecular weight of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 moles

   - From the reaction equation, 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH
   - Moles of NaOH required to react with 0.1 moles of H₂SO₄ = 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 moles
   - Since 0.25 moles of NaOH are added, which is more than 0.2 moles required, NaOH is in excess, and H₂SO₄ is the limiting reactant.

1. **Translation of the Problem:** The problem asks how many grams of carbon will combine with 3 grams of oxygen to form carbon dioxide.

2. **Understanding CO2 Composition:** A carbon dioxide molecule is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (CO2).

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that we have a wire with a cross-sectional area to be measured. The linear scale reading is 2 mm, the circular scale reading is 0.40 mm, the circular scale is divided into 100 parts, and the pitch of the instrument is 1 mm.

2. **Understanding the Scales:**
- The linear scale is used for direct measurements.
- The circular scale is used for more precise measurements and is divided into 100 parts.
- The pitch of the instrument is the distance between two consecutive threads, which in this case is 1 mm.

3. **Calculation:**
First, we need to find the least count of the circular scale. Since the pitch is 1 mm and the circular scale reads 0.40 mm (which corresponds to 40% of the pitch), we can infer that the reading on the circular scale indicates a fraction of the pitch.

Given that the circular scale is divided into 100 parts and each part represents an equal fraction of the pitch (1 mm), the least count of the circular scale can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Least Count of Circular Scale} = \frac{\text{Pitch}}{\text{Number of Divisions}} = \frac{1 \, \text{mm}}{100} = 0.01 \, \text{mm} \]

However, the problem asks for the number on the circular scale that coincides with the linear scale reading. The linear scale reading is 2 mm, and we are looking for how many divisions on the circular scale (each division being 0.01 mm) would add up to a reading that matches or closely matches the linear scale in terms of measurement significance.

Since the circular scale reading given is 0.40 mm, which is 40 divisions (0.40 mm / 0.01 mm per division), and we are trying to find out which division on the circular scale would align with a linear measurement in a meaningful way, we need to reconsider what the question is asking. The question seems to be about finding the division on the circular scale that corresponds to a significant match with the linear scale, considering the pitch and the given readings.

Now, let's solve the problem.

The kinetic energy (KE) of an object can be calculated using the formula:
KE = 0.5 * m * v^2

where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.

For the second object (10 kg) with a velocity of 5 m/s:
KE = 0.5 * 10 kg * (5 m/s)^2
KE = 0.5 * 10 kg * 25 m^2/s^2
KE = 125 J

1. **Translation of the problem:** The problem states that there are 80 grams of sodium hydroxide in 2 liters. We need to find the density.

2. **Solution:** Given that the mass of sodium hydroxide is 80 grams and the volume is 2 liters, we can calculate the density using the formula density = mass/volume. However, to maintain consistency in units, we should convert the volume from liters to cubic centimeters (or milliliters), knowing that 1 liter = 1000 milliliters (ml) or 1000 cubic centimeters (cm³).

Translation: When a die and a coin are tossed together, what is the probability of getting an odd number on the die and a head on the coin?

Now, let's break down the problem:

- A standard die has 6 faces, with 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6). The probability of getting an odd number on a die toss is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (odd numbers) out of 6 possible outcomes. Simplifying 3/6 gives us 1/2.

- A coin has 2 faces, with 1 face being heads and the other being tails. The probability of getting a head on a coin toss is 1/2, since there is 1 favorable outcome (head) out of 2 possible outcomes.

When two independent events occur together (like tossing a die and a coin), the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, the probability of getting an odd number on the die and a head on the coin is calculated as follows:

Probability of an odd number on the die = 1/2
Probability of a head on the coin = 1/2

Combined probability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4

Therefore, the probability of getting an odd number on the die and a head on the coin when they are tossed together is 1/4.

The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of hydrogen gas (H₂) reacts with 1 mole of chlorine gas (Cl₂) to produce 2 moles of hydrochloric acid (HCl).

First, let's calculate the number of moles of hydrogen and chlorine given:

- The molar mass of hydrogen (H₂) is approximately 2 grams/mole.
- The molar mass of chlorine (Cl₂) is approximately 71 grams/mole.

Given:
- Mass of hydrogen = 1 gram
- Mass of chlorine = 85 grams

Number of moles of hydrogen = mass of hydrogen / molar mass of hydrogen = 1 / 2 = 0.5 moles
Number of moles of chlorine = mass of chlorine / molar mass of chlorine = 85 / 71 ≈ 1.197 moles

Since the reaction requires a 1:1 mole ratio between hydrogen and chlorine, the limiting reactant (the reactant that will be completely used up first) is hydrogen, with 0.5 moles.

Thus, the maximum amount of chlorine that can react with hydrogen is equal to the number of moles of hydrogen, which is 0.5 moles.

To find the mass of chlorine that can react, we multiply the number of moles of hydrogen by the molar mass of chlorine:
Mass of chlorine that can react = 0.5 moles * 71 grams/mole = 35.5 grams

Therefore, the maximum amount of chlorine that can react with 1 gram of hydrogen is 35.5 grams.

The molecular weights of hydrogen (H2) and chlorine (Cl2) are approximately 2 grams/mole and 71 grams/mole, respectively.

Given:
- 1 gram of hydrogen (H2)
- 70 grams of chlorine (Cl2)

First, let's calculate the number of moles of hydrogen and chlorine:

Moles of H2 = mass of H2 / molecular weight of H2 = 1 g / 2 g/mole = 0.5 moles
Moles of Cl2 = mass of Cl2 / molecular weight of Cl2 = 70 g / 71 g/mole ≈ 0.986 moles

Since the reaction requires a 1:1 mole ratio of H2 to Cl2, and we have 0.5 moles of H2, we need 0.5 moles of Cl2 to react completely with the hydrogen.

Moles of Cl2 needed = 0.5 moles
Mass of Cl2 needed = moles of Cl2 needed * molecular weight of Cl2 = 0.5 moles * 71 g/mole = 35.5 g

This means 35.5 grams of Cl2 will react with 1 gram of H2.

To find out how much chlorine is left after the reaction:

Initial mass of Cl2 = 70 g
Mass of Cl2 used = 35.5 g
Mass of Cl2 left = Initial mass of Cl2 - Mass of Cl2 used = 70 g - 35.5 g = 34.5 g

The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.

The problem statement in English is: 
""A wire's diameter is found to be 7.28 mm using a screw gauge with a pitch of 0.50 mm and a least count of 0.01 mm. How many divisions on the circular scale are crossed?""

Given:
- Pitch of the screw gauge = 0.50 mm
- Least count of the screw gauge = 0.01 mm
- Measured diameter of the wire = 7.28 mm

The least count of a screw gauge is the distance moved by the screw for one complete rotation of the circular scale, divided by the number of divisions on the scale. However, it's also equal to the pitch divided by the number of divisions on the circular scale.

Given the least count (0.01 mm) and the pitch (0.50 mm), we can calculate the number of divisions on the circular scale as follows:
Least count = Pitch / Number of divisions
0.01 mm = 0.50 mm / Number of divisions
Number of divisions = 0.50 mm / 0.01 mm
Number of divisions = 50

Therefore, the number of divisions on the circular scale is 50.

Now, to find out how many divisions on the circular scale are crossed when the diameter of the wire is measured as 7.28 mm, we consider the pitch. The screw gauge advances by its pitch for each full rotation of the circular scale. 

Given the diameter (7.28 mm) and the pitch (0.50 mm), we calculate the number of full rotations (which corresponds to the number on the linear scale) and then find the additional fraction of a rotation that corresponds to the divisions on the circular scale.

Number of full rotations = Integer part of (7.28 mm / 0.50 mm) = Integer part of 14.56 = 14

The decimal part (0.56) represents the fraction of a rotation that corresponds to the circular scale divisions:
Fraction of a rotation = 0.56
Since one full rotation corresponds to 50 divisions (as calculated earlier), 
Number of divisions crossed = 0.56 * 50

Calculating the number of divisions crossed:
= 0.56 * 50
= 28

Thus, when measuring a diameter of 7.28 mm, 28 divisions on the circular scale are crossed, in addition to the full"

The weight of the water displaced can be calculated by knowing the density of water and the volume of water displaced. The density of water is approximately 1000 kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3).

**Translation:** An object of 1 kg mass is thrown vertically upwards. It falls to the ground after 10 seconds. What will be the potential energy of the object at its maximum height in joules?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Mass of the object (m) = 1 kg
- Time taken to fall back to the ground (t) = 10 seconds

First, we need to find the maximum height (h) the object reaches. Since the object is thrown vertically upwards and falls back to the ground, the acceleration due to gravity (g) acts upon it. We use the equation for the time it takes for an object under constant acceleration to reach its maximum height and fall back:

\[ t = \frac{2v_0}{g} \]

where \(v_0\) is the initial velocity. However, since we're not directly given \(v_0\), we'll use another approach to find the maximum height, considering the symmetry of the motion under constant acceleration.

At the maximum height, the velocity of the object is 0 m/s. The time to reach the maximum height is half of the total time for the ascent and descent, so:

\[ t_{\text{ascent}} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \]

We can use the equation of motion under constant acceleration to find the initial velocity \(v_0\), given that at the maximum height, the final velocity \(v = 0\):

\[ v = v_0 - gt \]
\[ 0 = v_0 - 9.81 \times 5 \]
\[ v_0 = 9.81 \times 5 \]
\[ v_0 = 49.05 \, \text{m/s} \]

Now, we can find the maximum height using the equation for the height of an object under constant acceleration:

\[ h = v_0t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \]
\[ h = 49.05 \times 5 - \frac{1}{2} \times 9.81 \times 5^2 \]
\[ h = 245.25 - \frac{1}{2} \times 9.81 \times 25 \]
\[ h = 245.25 - 122.625 \]

The formula to calculate the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where V is the volume, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, r is the radius of the base, and h is the height of the cylinder.

Substituting the given values into the formula:
V = π * (2)² * 4
V = 3.14159 * 4 * 4
V = 3.14159 * 16
V ≈ 50.26548

1. **Translate the problem into English for clarity:**
""The coin is tossed 2000 times and it comes up heads 1030 times. What is the probability of getting a tail when the coin is tossed once?""

2. **Calculate the probability:**
- The total number of tosses = 2000
- The number of times the coin lands on heads = 1030
- Therefore, the number of times the coin lands on tails = Total tosses - Heads = 2000 - 1030 = 970

The probability of an event happening is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. 

So, the probability of getting a tail in one toss = Number of tails / Total number of tosses = 970 / 2000 = 0.485

The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is given by C = πd, where d is the diameter of the circle and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.

1. **Translation of the Problem**: The problem states that the difference in the circumferences of two wheels is 70 cm. We need to find the difference in their diameters.

2. **Solution**:
    - Let's denote the diameter of the larger wheel as D1 and the diameter of the smaller wheel as D2.
    - The circumferences of the two wheels can be represented as C1 = πD1 and C2 = πD2, respectively.
    - Given that the difference in their circumferences is 70 cm, we have the equation: C1 - C2 = 70 cm.
    - Substituting the formulas for C1 and C2, we get πD1 - πD2 = 70 cm.
    - Factoring out π, we have π(D1 - D2) = 70 cm.
    - To find the difference in diameters (D1 - D2), we divide both sides of the equation by π: D1 - D2 = 70 cm / π.
    - Using the approximation π ≈ 3.14159, we calculate the difference: D1 - D2 ≈ 70 cm / 3.14159 ≈ 22.28 cm.

The most relevant reaction here is the decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or the reaction of calcium (Ca) with oxygen (O2) to form calcium oxide (CaO). However, given the information, we will consider the reaction of calcium with oxygen:

Ca + O2 → 2CaO

But to simplify and directly address the problem with the information given (56 grams of CaO), we'll consider the direct formation of CaO from its elements or a relevant compound. 

The molar mass of CaO is approximately 56.08 g/mol (Calcium = 40.08 g/mol, Oxygen = 16.00 g/mol). 

Given that 56 grams of CaO is produced, and knowing the molar mass of CaO, we can calculate the number of moles of CaO produced:

Moles of CaO = Mass of CaO / Molar mass of CaO = 56 g / 56.08 g/mol ≈ 1 mol

Since the molar mass of oxygen in CaO is 16.00 g/mol, and there is one oxygen atom per molecule of CaO, the mass of oxygen needed to produce 1 mole (or 56 grams) of CaO is:

Mass of Oxygen = Moles of CaO * Molar mass of Oxygen in CaO = 1 mol * 16.00 g/mol = 16 g

So, to produce 56 grams of calcium oxide, 16 grams of oxygen are required.

The distance covered by a freely falling object is given by the equation \(d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2\), where \(d\) is the distance, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\)), and \(t\) is the time in seconds.

1. **Translation of the problem:** A freely falling object covers 25 meters in 5 seconds. How much distance will the object cover in the 6th second?

Given that the object covers 25 meters in 5 seconds, we can first calculate the acceleration due to gravity using the given distance and time. However, since the question asks for the distance covered in the 6th second, we'll directly approach it by calculating the distance covered in the first 5 seconds and then in 6 seconds, using the formula for free fall.

The formula for distance in free fall is \(d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2\). 

Given \(d = 25 \, \text{m}\) and \(t = 5 \, \text{s}\), we rearrange the formula to find \(g\), but since \(g\) is a constant, we'll directly use the given information to calculate distances.

2. **Calculating distance covered in 5 seconds and then in 6 seconds:**

- Distance covered in 5 seconds (\(d_5\)) is given as \(25 \, \text{m}\).
- To find the distance covered in 6 seconds (\(d_6\)), we use \(d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2\), but since we don't need to explicitly calculate \(g\) and the question is about comparative distances, let's consider the relationship of distances covered in successive intervals of time for a freely falling object.

For an object under constant acceleration (like gravity), the distance covered in each successive time interval increases linearly with the odd integers (1st, 3rd, 5th, ... seconds) if we were considering intervals of 1 second. However, here we're looking at a slightly different scenario where we know the total distance covered in 5 seconds and want to find the distance covered in the next (6th) second.

The chemical reaction for the production of calcium oxide from calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or other calcium compounds typically involves the decomposition of calcium carbonate:

However, since the problem does not specify the starting compound, we'll consider a more general approach focusing on the production of CaO directly, which requires oxygen. The direct production of CaO from calcium (Ca) involves:

2Ca + O2 → 2CaO

From this equation, we can see that 1 mole of O2 produces 2 moles of CaO.

The molar mass of CaO is approximately 56.08 g/mol (Calcium = 40.08 g/mol, Oxygen = 16.00 g/mol).

Given that 56 grams of CaO are produced, we first calculate how many moles of CaO this represents:

Moles of CaO = Mass of CaO / Molar mass of CaO
Moles of CaO = 56 g / 56.08 g/mol ≈ 1 mol

Since 1 mole of O2 produces 2 moles of CaO, to produce 1 mole of CaO, we need:

Moles of O2 = Moles of CaO / 2

Translation: If an object is dropped from the roof of a 50-meter tall building, at what speed will it hit the ground?

To find the speed at which the object hits the ground, we use the equation for the velocity of an object under constant acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s^2). Since the object is dropped, the initial velocity (v_i) is 0 m/s. The equation to find the final velocity (v_f) when the object hits the ground is derived from the equation of motion:

v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 * g * h

- v_f is the final velocity,
- v_i is the initial velocity (0 m/s in this case),
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2),
- h is the height from which the object is dropped (50 meters in this case).

Plugging the values into the equation:

v_f^2 = 0^2 + 2 * 9.81 * 50
v_f^2 = 0 + 981

The problem states that from a distance of 500 kilometers, a mountain makes an angle of 5 degrees. We need to find the height of the mountain in meters.

2. **Solution:**
To find the height of the mountain, we can use trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, which relates the angle, the height of the mountain (opposite side), and the distance from the mountain (adjacent side). The formula for tangent is tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent.

Given:
- Angle = 5 degrees
- Distance (adjacent side) = 500 kilometers = 500,000 meters (since 1 km = 1000 meters)

tan(5 degrees) = height / 500,000 meters

To find the height, we rearrange the formula:
height = 500,000 meters * tan(5 degrees)

Now, we calculate the tangent of 5 degrees and then multiply it by 500,000 meters.

tan(5 degrees) ≈ 0.0875

- Mass of NaOH = 10 grams
- Mass of CO2 = 5 grams

First, we need to find the molar masses of NaOH and CO2 to calculate the number of moles of each:

- Molar mass of NaOH = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 grams/mole
- Molar mass of CO2 = 12 (C) + 2*16 (O) = 44 grams/mole

Now, calculate the number of moles of NaOH and CO2:

- Moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 10 / 40 = 0.25 moles
- Moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2 = 5 / 44 ≈ 0.1136 moles

According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the limiting reactant needs to be identified. 

Since 0.1136 moles of CO2 would react with 2*0.1136 = 0.2272 moles of NaOH, and we have 0.25 moles of NaOH, CO2 is the limiting reactant.

This means all 0.1136 moles of CO2 will react, using 0.2272 moles of NaOH (since 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2).

Now, calculate the amount of NaOH left:

- Moles of NaOH left = initial moles of NaOH - moles of NaOH reacted
= 0.25 - 0.2272
= 0.0228 moles

Finally, convert the moles of NaOH left back into grams:

- Mass of NaOH left = moles of NaOH left * molar mass of NaOH

""Given a circle with a radius of 5 cm, an arc within this circle subtends an angle of 60 degrees at the center. What is the approximate length of this arc in centimeters?""

Now, to find the length of the arc, we use the formula for arc length, which is given by:

Arc Length = (θ / 360) * 2 * π * r

where θ is the angle subtended at the center in degrees, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.

Given θ = 60 degrees, r = 5 cm, and π ≈ 3.14159, we substitute these values into the formula:

Arc Length = (60 / 360) * 2 * 3.14159 * 5

First, simplify the fraction:
(60 / 360) = (1 / 6)

Then, calculate the rest:
Arc Length = (1 / 6) * 2 * 3.14159 * 5
           = (1 / 6) * 10 * 3.14159

The problem states: ""If one-fourth of the circumference of a circular path with a radius of 10 meters is traversed, what will be the displacement in meters?""

2. **Solution:**
- The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.
- Given the radius \(r = 10\) meters, we can calculate the circumference: \(C = 2 \times \pi \times 10 = 20\pi\) meters.
- One-fourth of the circumference is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\pi = 5\pi\) meters.
- Since the question asks for the displacement when one-fourth of the circumference is traversed, and assuming the traversal is along the circumference (which is the path around the circle), the displacement would be equal to the length of the path traveled, which is \(5\pi\) meters.

The problem states that the wheel travels 4 kilometers (which is 4000 meters) in 70 rotations. 

1. Translate the problem into English for clarity: 
A wheel rotates 70 times to cover a distance of 4 kilometers. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?

2. Solution:
The circumference of the wheel (C) is related to its diameter (D) by the formula C = πD, where π is approximately 3.14159.

Given that the wheel covers 4000 meters in 70 rotations, we can find the circumference of the wheel as follows:
Circumference (C) = Total distance / Number of rotations
C = 4000 meters / 70
C = 57.1429 meters (approximately)

Now, using the formula C = πD, we can solve for the diameter (D):
D = C / π
D = 57.1429 / 3.14159
D ≈ 18.2 meters

However, it seems there was a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach should directly use the formula for circumference and the given distance covered in relation to the number of rotations to find the diameter without assuming an approximate value for π in the intermediate steps. Let's correct that:

Given that the distance covered in 70 rotations is 4000 meters, the circumference of the wheel can be found as:
C = 4000 meters / 70 rotations = 57.1429 meters per rotation.

Using the exact formula C = πD, where C is the circumference of one rotation (57.1429 meters), we solve for D:
57.1429 = πD
D = 57.1429 / π

To maintain precision, we recognize that 57.1429 is actually 4000/70, and π is approximately 3.14159. The calculation then is:
D = (4000 / 70) / π
D ≈ 18.2 meters, but recognizing the calculation error, let's properly calculate without premature approximation:
D = (4000 meters / 70) / π
Since 4000/70 is the circumference for one rotation and equals 57.142857 (a more precise division), 
D = 57.142857 / π ≈ 18.18 meters, but this was still approached with an"

The smallest division of the main scale is 0.5 mm, and 19 divisions of the main scale are equal to 20 divisions of the Vernier scale. We need to find the Vernier constant in mm.

2. Solution:
Given:
- Main scale division (1 MSD) = 0.5 mm
- 19 MSD = 20 Vernier scale divisions (VSD)
- Vernier scale coincidence = 16

The least count of the Vernier caliper can be found using the formula:
Least count = 1 MSD / (Number of VSD in 19 MSD)
However, to find the Vernier constant, we first calculate the length of 19 MSD:

Since 19 MSD = 20 VSD, we can find the value of 1 VSD:
1 VSD = 9.5 mm / 20 = 0.475 mm

The Vernier constant (VC) is the difference between 1 MSD and 1 VSD:
VC = 1 MSD - 1 VSD

1. **Translation of the problem into English:** A cow is tied with a rope in such a way that the cow can eat the grass of a 25 square meter circular field. What is the diameter of the field?

2. **Solution:**
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(A\) is the area and \(r\) is the radius.
   - Given \(A = 25\) square meters, we can set up the equation as \(25 = \pi r^2\).
   - To solve for \(r\), we rearrange the equation: \(r^2 = \frac{25}{\pi}\).
   - Taking the square root of both sides gives \(r = \sqrt{\frac{25}{\pi}}\).
   - The diameter (\(d\)) of the circle is twice the radius, so \(d = 2r = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{25}{\pi}}\).
   - Simplifying, \(d = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{25}{\pi}} = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{25}}{\sqrt{\pi}} = 2 \times \frac{5}{\sqrt{\pi}}\).
   - Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{\pi}\), we get \(d = \frac{10\sqrt{\pi}}{\pi}\).

The molecular formula for copper sulfate is CuSO4. 
The atomic weights are approximately: Cu (copper) = 63.55 g/mol, S (sulfur) = 32.07 g/mol, and O (oxygen) = 16.00 g/mol.

The molecular weight of CuSO4 can be calculated as follows:
- Cu: 63.55 g/mol
- S: 32.07 g/mol
- O4: 4 * 16.00 g/mol = 64.00 g/mol
So, the molecular weight of CuSO4 = 63.55 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 159.62 g/mol

Since the problem asks for the molecular weight of 2 moles of copper sulfate, we multiply the molecular weight by 2:
2 * 159.62 g/mol = 319.24 g

Therefore, the molecular weight of 2 moles of copper sulfate is 319.24 grams.

 Translation: Among some students, 60 like cricket, 40 like football, and 25 like both games. How many like at least one game?

To find the number of students who like at least one game, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps in counting the elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets and then adjusting for the overlaps (to avoid double counting).

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the set of students who like cricket,
- \(F\) as the set of students who like football,
- \(|C|\) as the number of students who like cricket = 60,
- \(|F|\) as the number of students who like football = 40,
- \(|C \cap F|\) as the number of students who like both cricket and football = 25.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that the number of students who like at least one game is given by:
\[|C \cup F| = |C| + |F| - |C \cap F|\]

Now, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total height the boy climbs. Since there are 20 steps and each step is 16 cm high, the total height climbed is:
20 steps * 16 cm/step = 320 cm = 3.2 m (converting cm to m)

2. The boy climbs this height in 15 seconds. To find the power, we need to calculate the work done and then divide it by the time taken.

3. The work done (W) can be calculated using the formula W = Force * Distance. Here, the force is the weight of the boy, which is his mass * acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s^2).
So, the force (F) = 40 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 392 N

4. Now, the work done (W) = Force * Distance = 392 N * 3.2 m = 1254.4 J

5. The power (P) is calculated as the work done divided by the time taken: P = W / t = 1254.4 J / 15 s = 83.6267 W

**Translation:** A metallic solid sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 36 cm. What is the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The volume of the sphere (V) can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.
V = (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic cm.

2. When the sphere is melted to form a cylinder, the volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
36π = πr²(36)
r² = 1
r = 1 cm (since the radius cannot be negative)

3. Now, we need to find the curved surface area of the cylinder. The formula for the curved surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height.
A = 2π(1)(36) = 72π square cm.

1. Translation of the problem: The problem asks for the probability of a Test cricket match ending in a draw.

In Test cricket, a match can end in one of three results: a win for one of the teams or a draw. Unlike limited-overs cricket, where the match duration is fixed and a result (win/loss) is always achieved within that timeframe, Test cricket matches are played over several days, and the match can end without a definitive winner if the teams do not complete the required number of innings within the allotted time or if the weather intervenes.

2. Calculation: However, calculating the probability of a draw in a Test cricket match directly from the problem statement is challenging because it lacks specific details about the teams' performance, the pitch conditions, weather forecasts, and other factors that could influence the match outcome.

But, if we approach this from a general statistical perspective, we can consider historical data to estimate probabilities. Given that we do not have specific numbers or percentages provided in the problem, we'll rely on general knowledge. Historically, across all Test matches, there is a notable percentage that ends in a draw, but this percentage can vary over time due to changes in rules, playing conditions, and team strategies.

Without specific historical data or a range of outcomes provided in the question, we must recognize that this problem does not supply enough detail to calculate a precise probability. However, for the sake of following instructions, let's recognize that the probability of a draw in Test cricket, based on historical trends, can be significant but is decreasing due to various factors including rule changes aimed at producing results.

Given the lack of specific information, it's not feasible to provide a precise numerical answer. However, acknowledging the format requirement and considering that a significant portion of Test matches can end in a draw (though the exact figure can vary and has been decreasing over the years), one might estimate a probability, but without exact historical data, any figure would be speculative.

So, the volume of the sphere \( V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (1)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \) cubic cm.

3. Calculate the volume of the cylinder:
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \( \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.
Since the sphere fits exactly into the cylinder, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the diameter of the cylinder's base, making the radius of the cylinder's base also 1 cm.
The height of the cylinder is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 2 cm, because the sphere touches the top and bottom bases of the cylinder.
So, the volume of the cylinder \( V_{cylinder} = \pi (1)^2 (2) = 2\pi \) cubic cm.

4. Calculate the volume of the unoccupied part of the cylinder:
The volume of the unoccupied part is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the sphere, \( V_{unoccupied} = V_{cylinder} - V_{sphere} = 2\pi - \frac{4}{3}\pi \).
Simplifying, \( V_{unoccupied} = \frac{6\pi}{3} - \frac{4\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \) cubic cm.

Given \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), \( V_{unoccupied} \approx \frac{2 \times 3.14159}{3} \approx 2.0944 \) cubic cm.

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""At what velocity should an object be thrown vertically upwards so that it hits the ground after 10 seconds?""

We know that the time it takes for an object thrown vertically upwards to return to the ground depends on its initial velocity and the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s^2). The equation for the time of flight (t) is given by:
t = 2 * v0 / g

where v0 is the initial velocity, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Since we want the object to hit the ground after 10 seconds, we can set up the equation:
10 = 2 * v0 / 9.81

To solve for v0, we can rearrange the equation:
v0 = 10 * 9.81 / 2
v0 = 98.1 / 2
v0 = 49.05 m/s

Therefore, the object should be thrown vertically upwards at a velocity of 49.05 m/s to hit the ground after 10 seconds.

The reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O2) to form magnesium oxide (MgO) is as follows:

2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

From the given information, we have 2 grams of magnesium and 2 grams of oxygen. The molar masses of magnesium and oxygen are approximately 24.3 g/mol and 32 g/mol, respectively. The molar mass of magnesium oxide is approximately 40.3 g/mol.

First, let's calculate the number of moles of magnesium and oxygen:

Moles of Mg = mass of Mg / molar mass of Mg = 2 g / 24.3 g/mol ≈ 0.0823 mol
Moles of O2 = mass of O2 / molar mass of O2 = 2 g / 32 g/mol ≈ 0.0625 mol

According to the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O2. Therefore, the limiting reactant (the reactant that will be completely consumed first) needs to be determined.

Since 0.0823 mol of Mg would require 0.04115 mol of O2 (half of the Mg moles because the ratio is 2:1), magnesium is in excess because we have more than enough oxygen to react with all the magnesium (0.0625 mol of O2 is more than 0.04115 mol needed for the reaction with Mg). However, considering the stoichiometry and the given masses, oxygen is actually the limiting reactant here because we have less oxygen than what would be needed for all the magnesium to react based on the balanced equation.

The balanced equation indicates that 1 mole of O2 produces 2 moles of MgO. Given that we have 0.0625 mol of O2, this would produce:

0.0625 mol O2 * (2 mol MgO / 1 mol O2) = 0.125 mol MgO

The molar mass of MgO is 40.3 g/mol. So, the mass of MgO produced is:

0.125 mol MgO * 40.3 g/mol ≈ 5.038 g

1. **Translation of the problem:** 0.1 moles of sulfuric acid is equal to how many grams of sulfuric acid?

2. **Calculation:**
   - The molar mass of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can be calculated as follows:
     - Hydrogen (H) has a molar mass of approximately 1 g/mol. Since there are 2 hydrogens, that's 2*1 = 2 g/mol.

2. Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), i.e., \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\).

First, let's translate the given problem into English for clarity:
""17.75 grams of sodium sulfate is dissolved in a 250 mL solution, what is the density of the solution?""

To find the density of the solution, we need to calculate the mass of the solution and then divide it by the volume of the solution. 

The mass of the sodium sulfate is given as 17.75 grams. To find the mass of the solution, we also need to know the mass of the solvent (water), which is not directly given. However, we can proceed by calculating the mass of the solution using the given information and the density of water.

The density of water is approximately 1 gram per milliliter (g/mL). Therefore, the mass of 250 mL of water is:
250 mL * 1 g/mL = 250 grams

Since the density of a solution is the total mass of the solution divided by its total volume, and assuming the volume of the sodium sulfate is negligible compared to the volume of the solvent (which is a reasonable assumption for dilute solutions), the total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of the sodium sulfate and the mass of the water:
Total mass = mass of sodium sulfate + mass of water
Total mass = 17.75 grams + 250 grams = 267.75 grams

The total volume of the solution is given as 250 mL. 

Now, we can calculate the density of the solution:

The potential energy of an object is given by the formula PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height of the object above the ground. The kinetic energy of an object is given by the formula KE = 0.5mv^2, where v is the velocity of the object.

However, to compare the kinetic energy at a certain height to the potential energy, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. As the object falls, its potential energy converts into kinetic energy.

Given:
- Initial height (h1) = 60 m
- Final height (h2) = 10 m
- Mass (m) = 2 kg
- g = 9.8 m/s^2

The potential energy at the initial height (PE1) is:
PE1 = m * g * h1 = 2 * 9.8 * 60 = 1176 J

The potential energy at the final height (PE2) is:
PE2 = m * g * h2 = 2 * 9.8 * 10 = 196 J

According to the conservation of energy, the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy at any point is constant. Therefore, the kinetic energy at the final height (KE2) can be found by subtracting the potential energy at the final height from the initial potential energy:
KE2 = PE1 - PE2 = 1176 - 196 = 980 J

Now, let's solve the problem. A x A represents the Cartesian product of set A with itself. This means we need to find all possible ordered pairs where the first element of the pair is from set A, and the second element is also from set A.

Set A has 4 elements: 1, 4, 6, 8. So, the Cartesian product A x A will have 4 x 4 = 16 ordered pairs, since for each of the 4 elements in the first position, there are 4 possible elements in the second position.

Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs in A x A is 16.

""Translation: If the difference in the circumference of two wheels is 120 cm, then what is the difference in their diameters in cm?""

Now, let's solve the problem. The formula for the circumference of a circle (or wheel, in this case) is given by C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.

Let the diameter of the larger wheel be d1 and the diameter of the smaller wheel be d2. We know that the difference in their circumferences is 120 cm. So, we can write:

πd1 - πd2 = 120

Now, let's factor out π from the left-hand side:

π(d1 - d2) = 120

To find the difference in diameters (d1 - d2), we can divide both sides by π:

d1 - d2 = 120 / π

Using the approximate value of π as 3.14, we get:

d1 - d2 ≈ 120 / 3.14
d1 - d2 ≈ 38.2

However, for an exact answer without approximations, we keep it in terms of π or calculate it directly as the question seems to expect a precise numerical value which might be simplified or rounded based on the context of the question.

Given the context, it seems we should look for a simpler, more direct approach to the solution, considering the formula and the information provided. The key insight is recognizing that the difference in circumferences directly relates to the difference in diameters through π. But to maintain precision without an explicit calculation involving π, let's reconsider our steps:

The difference in circumference is 120 cm, which means the larger wheel's circumference is 120 cm more than the smaller one. Since Circumference = π * diameter, the difference in circumferences (120 cm) divided by π gives the difference in diameters. However, since π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14, and we aim for a precise calculation:

Difference in diameters = Difference in circumferences / π

Given that we are to provide a numerical answer without specifying if it should be an exact value or an approximation, and considering standard mathematical practices, the solution directly calculates to:

Difference in diameters = 120 cm / π

Approximating π to 3.14 for calculation purposes:

616,২ লিটার দ্রবণে কত গ্রাম সোডিয়াম কার্বনেট যোগ করলে দ্রবণটি সেমিমোলার হবে?,১০৬,Chemistry,Chemistry,"To solve this problem, we first need to understand what a semimolar solution is. A semimolar solution, also known as a 0.5 molar solution, contains 0.5 moles of solute per liter of solution.

Given:
- The volume of the solution is 2 liters.
- We want to make the solution semimolar, meaning it should have 0.5 moles of solute (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) per liter.

First, let's calculate the total moles of sodium carbonate needed for 2 liters of solution to be semimolar:
Since the solution needs to be 0.5 molar, for 2 liters, we need 0.5 moles/liter * 2 liters = 1 mole of sodium carbonate.

The molecular weight of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is:
- Sodium (Na) has an atomic weight of approximately 23 g/mol. Since there are two sodium atoms, that's 2 * 23 = 46 g/mol.
- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16 g/mol.

Since there are three oxygen atoms, that's 3 * 16 = 48 g/mol.
So, the molecular weight of Na2CO3 = 46 (for Na) + 12 (for C) + 48 (for O) = 106 g/mol.

To find out how many grams of sodium carbonate are needed to make 1 mole, we use its molecular weight:
1 mole of Na2CO3 = 106 g.

Thus, to make a 2-liter solution semimolar in sodium carbonate, we need to add 106 grams of sodium carbonate.

The volume of a sphere (\(V_{sphere}\)) is given by the formula \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.
The volume of a cylinder (\(V_{cylinder}\)) is given by the formula \(\pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

Given that the sphere's radius is 6 cm and the cylinder's radius is 3 cm, we can calculate their volumes and set them equal to each other because the volume of the material does not change when it is melted and reshaped.

- Volume of the sphere: \(V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi (6)^3\)
- Volume of the cylinder: \(V_{cylinder} = \pi (3)^2 h\)

Setting \(V_{sphere} = V_{cylinder}\), we have:

The areas of the small and large pistons of a hydraulic press are 10 square centimeters and 350 square centimeters, respectively. If a force of 100 Newtons is applied to the small piston, how much force can be obtained on the large piston?

Now, let's solve the problem. 

In a hydraulic press, the force applied to the small piston is transmitted to the large piston through the fluid. The pressure (force per unit area) applied to the small piston is equal to the pressure applied to the large piston, as the fluid cannot sustain a pressure difference. 

Given:
- Area of the small piston (A1) = 10 square centimeters
- Area of the large piston (A2) = 350 square centimeters
- Force applied to the small piston (F1) = 100 Newtons

We need to find the force (F2) applied to the large piston.

The pressure (P) applied to the small piston is F1/A1, and this pressure is equal to the pressure F2/A2 applied to the large piston. So, we can write:

F1/A1 = F2/A2

Substituting the given values:

100/10 = F2/350

Simplifying:

10 = F2/350

Multiplying both sides by 350:

F2 = 10 * 350
F2 = 3500

Therefore, the force applied to the large piston is 3500 Newtons.

The chemical reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be represented as follows:

2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O

From the equation, we see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2 to produce 1 mole of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and 1 mole of water (H2O).

The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol, and the molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 g/mol. The molar mass of Na2CO3 is approximately 106 g/mol.

Given:
- Mass of NaOH = 10 g
- Mass of CO2 = 5 g

First, let's calculate the number of moles of NaOH and CO2:

Moles of NaOH = Mass of NaOH / Molar mass of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol
Moles of CO2 = Mass of CO2 / Molar mass of CO2 = 5 g / 44 g/mol ≈ 0.114 mol

Since the reaction requires 2 moles of NaOH for every 1 mole of CO2, and we have more than enough NaOH to react with all the CO2 (0.25 mol NaOH is more than twice 0.114 mol CO2), CO2 is the limiting reactant.

According to the reaction equation, 1 mole of CO2 produces 1 mole of Na2CO3. So, the moles of Na2CO3 produced will be equal to the moles of CO2 reacted, which is approximately 0.114 mol.

Now, let's calculate the mass of Na2CO3 produced:

Mass of Na2CO3 = Moles of Na2CO3 * Molar mass of Na2CO3 = 0.114 mol * 106 g/mol ≈ 12.084 g

Given that the molarity (M) is 0.125 moles per liter, and we have 750 mL (or 0.750 liters, since 1 liter = 1000 mL) of solution, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the number of moles:
moles of solute = Molarity * liters of solution
moles of solute = 0.125 M * 0.750 L

Calculating the number of moles:
moles of solute = 0.125 * 0.750
moles of solute = 0.09375

Therefore, the number of moles of potassium carbonate in the solution is 0.09375 moles.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem in Bengali translates to English as: ""What is the volume of 1 gram of nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure?""

2. **Solution:**
At standard temperature and pressure (STP), the conditions are defined as 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm (101.325 kPa). The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is approximately 22.4 liters per mole. 

First, we need to find the molar mass of nitrogen (N2). The atomic mass of nitrogen is approximately 14 g/mol. Since nitrogen gas is diatomic (N2), its molar mass is 28 g/mol (14 g/mol * 2).

To find the volume of 1 gram of nitrogen at STP, we use the formula for the volume of an ideal gas: V = nRT/P, where V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and P is the pressure. However, given that we know the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP (22.4 L/mol), we can calculate the volume of 1 gram of nitrogen more directly.

The number of moles in 1 gram of nitrogen is calculated as follows: moles = mass / molar mass = 1 g / 28 g/mol.

So, moles = 1 / 28 mol.

Knowing that 1 mole of any ideal gas at STP occupies 22.4 liters, we can find the volume of 1/28 mole of nitrogen:

Volume = (1/28 mol) * 22.4 L/mol.

Performing the calculation: Volume = (1/28) * 22.4 = 0.8 L.

Therefore, the volume of 1 gram of nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure is 0.8 liters.

1. **Translation of the problem into English:**
""The object is thrown straight upwards at a speed of 196 m/s. What will be the speed after 10 seconds?""

2. **Solution:**
   - Initial velocity (v0) = 196 m/s (upwards)
   - Acceleration due to gravity (g) = -9.8 m/s^2 (downwards)
   - Time (t) = 10 seconds

   The formula to find the velocity (v) after a certain time (t) under constant acceleration is:
   \[ v = v0 + at \]

   Substituting the given values:
   \[ v = 196 + (-9.8) \times 10 \]
   \[ v = 196 - 98 \]
   \[ v = 98 \, \text{m/s} \]

   Since the object is moving upwards initially and after 10 seconds it would have reached its maximum height and started falling, the direction of the velocity changes. However, the question asks for the speed, which is a scalar quantity and does not consider direction.

The balanced chemical equation for the formation of ammonia (NH3) from hydrogen and nitrogen is:

N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to form 2 moles of ammonia.

Given:
- Mass of hydrogen gas (H2) = 5 grams
- Mass of nitrogen gas (N2) = 30 grams

First, we need to find the number of moles of hydrogen and nitrogen using their molar masses. The molar mass of H2 is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of N2 is approximately 28 grams/mole.

1. Moles of hydrogen (H2):
   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass
   Moles of H2 = 5 grams / 2 grams/mole = 2.5 moles

2. Moles of nitrogen (N2):
   Moles of N2 = 30 grams / 28 grams/mole ≈ 1.0714 moles

Now, let's determine the limiting reactant. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of N2 reacts with 3 moles of H2. 

- For 1.0714 moles of N2, we would need 3 * 1.0714 = 3.2142 moles of H2 to react completely with all the nitrogen.
- However, we only have 2.5 moles of H2, which is less than 3.2142 moles required for all the nitrogen to react.

Therefore, hydrogen (H2) is the limiting reactant, meaning it will be completely used up in the reaction, and some nitrogen will be left over.

Since 3 moles of H2 react with 1 mole of N2, 2.5 moles of H2 will react with (2.5 / 3) moles of N2.

Moles of N2 that react = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 moles

Initially, we had 1.0714 moles of N2. So, the moles of N2 left over after the reaction will be:

Moles of N2 left = Initial moles of N2 - Moles of N2 that react

The molecular weight of Ca₃(PO₄)₂ can be calculated as follows:
- Calcium: 3 * 40.08 = 120.24 g/mol
- Phosphorus: 2 * 30.97 = 61.94 g/mol
- Oxygen: 8 * 16.00 = 128.00 g/mol

The formula for linear thermal expansion is given by ΔL = αL₀ΔT, where ΔL is the change in length, α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, L₀ is the initial length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Translating the given problem into English:
""If a steel beam has a length of 20 meters at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, what will be the increase in its length when the temperature rises to 100 degrees Celsius? The coefficient of thermal expansion of steel is 11.6 x 10^-6 per Kelvin.""

Given values:
- Initial length (L₀) = 20 meters
- Initial temperature (T₁) = 60 degrees Celsius = 333 Kelvin
- Final temperature (T₂) = 100 degrees Celsius = 373 Kelvin
- Coefficient of thermal expansion (α) = 11.6 x 10^-6 per Kelvin

Change in temperature (ΔT) = T₂ - T₁ = 373 Kelvin - 333 Kelvin = 40 Kelvin

Now, we can calculate the change in length (ΔL) using the formula:
ΔL = αL₀ΔT = (11.6 x 10^-6 per Kelvin) * (20 meters) * (40 Kelvin)

ΔL = 11.6 x 10^-6 * 20 * 40
ΔL = 11.6 x 10^-6 * 800
ΔL = 9.28 x 10^-3 meters

To convert this into a more understandable format, we can express this in millimeters since the change is very small:
ΔL = 9.28 x 10^-3 meters * 1000 (since 1 meter = 1000 millimeters)
ΔL = 9.28 millimeters

Therefore, the increase in the length of the steel beam when the temperature rises from 60 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees Celsius is 9.28 millimeters.

The formula for the circumference of a circle (such as a wheel) is C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter of the circle.

Given that the wheel travels 3.25 kilometers (which is 3250 meters, since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) in 25 rotations, we can calculate the circumference of the wheel as follows:

1. Convert the total distance traveled into meters: 3.25 km = 3250 meters.
2. Since the wheel rotates 25 times to cover this distance, the circumference of the wheel (which is the distance it travels in one rotation) can be found by dividing the total distance by the number of rotations: 
   Circumference = Total distance / Number of rotations
   Circumference = 3250 meters / 25
   Circumference = 130 meters

Now, knowing the circumference (C) is 130 meters, we can find the diameter (d) of the wheel using the formula C = πd, rearranged to solve for d: d = C / π.

3. Calculate the diameter:
   d = 130 meters / π
   d ≈ 130 meters / 3.14159
   d ≈ 41.37 meters

Therefore, the diameter of the wheel is approximately 41.37 meters.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem in English translates to: ""When 249.5 grams of blue vitriol is heated, 150 grams of white powder is obtained. What is the percentage yield of the product?""

2. **Solution:**
To find the percentage yield, we compare the actual yield (the amount of product obtained, which is 150 grams in this case) to the theoretical yield (the maximum amount of product that could be obtained based on the reaction).

However, without the chemical equation for the decomposition of blue vitriol (copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, CuSO4·5H2O) into the white powder (which could be anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4), we can still approach this problem from a general perspective.

The general formula for percentage yield is:
\[ \text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100 \]

But since we're not given the theoretical yield directly, and without knowing the specific chemical reaction, we might assume the question is asking for a comparison based on the mass change, not the actual yield from a specific chemical reaction equation.

Given that, if we assume the white powder is the product of heating blue vitriol and no other reactants are involved or produced, the percentage yield based on mass would be misleading without the context of a balanced chemical equation.

However, if the intent was to simply calculate the ratio of the product's mass to the reactant's mass as a ""yield"" in a very general sense (which is not the standard use of yield in chemistry but might be what's implied here due to lack of information), we could calculate:

\[ \text{Yield Ratio} = \left( \frac{150 \, \text{g}}{249.5 \, \text{g}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Yield Ratio} = \left( \frac{150}{249.5} \right) \times 100 \approx 60.1\% \]

- h is the height (2000 meters)
- u is the initial velocity (0, since the stone is dropped and not thrown upwards or downwards with any initial velocity)
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s^2)
- t is the time taken to hit the ground

Rearranging the equation to solve for t, we get:

t^2 = 2h / g
t = sqrt(2h / g)

Substituting the values of h and g into the equation:

t = sqrt((2 * 2000) / 10)

If the coin is flipped 300 times, the expected number of times tails can come up is calculated by multiplying the total number of flips by the probability of getting a tail. So, the calculation is as follows:

Expected number of tails = Total number of flips * Probability of getting a tail

Now, to find the acceleration, we use the formula: acceleration = change in speed / time taken.

First, we convert the speeds into meters per second since the standard unit for speed in the context of acceleration is meters per second (m/s). The conversion factor is that 1 km/h is equal to 5/18 m/s.

- Initial speed = 36 km/h = 36 * (5/18) m/s = 10 m/s
- Speed after 1 minute = 72 km/h = 72 * (5/18) m/s = 20 m/s
- Speed after 2 minutes = 108 km/h = 108 * (5/18) m/s = 30 m/s

The car accelerates from 10 m/s to 20 m/s in 1 minute (60 seconds), and then from 20 m/s to 30 m/s in the next 1 minute (60 seconds).

For the first minute: 
Change in speed = 20 m/s - 10 m/s = 10 m/s
Time taken = 60 seconds
Acceleration = change in speed / time taken = 10 m/s / 60 s = 1/6 m/s^2

The translation of the problem is: ""What is the molecular weight of 11 moles of hydrochloric acid?""

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) has a molecular weight of approximately 36.46 g/mol, which is calculated from the atomic weights of hydrogen (H) and chlorine (Cl). The atomic weight of H is about 1.008 g/mol, and the atomic weight of Cl is about 35.453 g/mol. So, the molecular weight of HCl = 1.008 (for H) + 35.453 (for Cl) = 36.461 g/mol.

Since the molecular weight of one mole of HCl is 36.461 g, the total weight of 11 moles of HCl would be 11 times the molecular weight of one mole.

Therefore, the molecular weight of 11 moles of hydrochloric acid = 11 * 36.461 g/mol = 401.071 g.

However, the question asks for the molecular weight, not the total weight of 11 moles. The molecular weight remains the same regardless of the number of moles, as it is a property of a single molecule of the substance.

Thus, the molecular weight of hydrochloric acid is 36.461 g/mol, regardless of the number of moles.

The cubes between 1 and 200 are: 1 (1^3), 8 (2^3), 27 (3^3), 64 (4^3), and 125 (5^3). There are 5 such numbers.

The total number of natural numbers between 1 and 200 is 200.

So, the probability of choosing a cube is the number of cubes divided by the total number of numbers:

Since the ball fits perfectly inside the box, the diameter of the ball is equal to the side length of the cube. The diameter of the ball is twice its radius, so the diameter is 2 * 3 = 6 cm. This means the side length of the cube is also 6 cm.

The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula \(V = a^3\), where \(a\) is the length of a side of the cube.

The translation of the problem is: 
""A 10-gram object is dropped from a height of 60 meters from the ground. At what height from the ground will the potential energy of the object be five times its kinetic energy?""

Let's denote the height at which the potential energy is five times the kinetic energy as 'h'. The total energy of the object remains constant throughout its fall. At the initial point (60 meters high), all the energy is in the form of potential energy. As it falls, the potential energy converts into kinetic energy.

The formula for potential energy is PE = m * g * h, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height.

The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where v is the velocity.

At the point where the potential energy is five times the kinetic energy, we can set up the equation:
m * g * h = 5 * 0.5 * m * v^2

Since the mass 'm' is constant and will cancel out, we can simplify this to:
g * h = 2.5 * v^2

We also know that at any point during the fall, the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy equals the initial potential energy (since energy is conserved). The initial potential energy is m * g * 60.

So, m * g * 60 = m * g * h + 0.5 * m * v^2

Simplifying and canceling 'm' gives us:
g * 60 = g * h + 0.5 * v^2

Now we have two equations:
1. g * h = 2.5 * v^2
2. g * 60 = g * h + 0.5 * v^2

Substituting the first equation into the second gives us:
g * 60 = 2.5 * v^2 + 0.5 * v^2
g * 60 = 3 * v^2

v^2 = (g * 60) / 3

Substituting v^2 into the equation g * h = 2.5 * v^2 gives us:
g * h = 2.5 * (g *"

""The problem states that there are 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid dissolved in a 500 milliliter solution. We are asked to find the density of the solution.""

To find the density of the solution, we use the formula: Density = Mass / Volume.

Given:
- Mass of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) = 24.5 grams
- Volume of the solution = 500 milliliters (mL) = 0.5 liters (L) = 500 cm^3 (since 1 mL = 1 cm^3)

However, to calculate the density of the solution, we need the total mass of the solution, not just the mass of sulfuric acid. Assuming the density of the solution is close to that of water (which is a reasonable assumption for dilute solutions), we can estimate the mass of the solvent (water) and then calculate the total mass of the solution.

The density of water is approximately 1 gram per milliliter (g/mL). 

So, the mass of water in 500 mL = 500 mL * 1 g/mL = 500 grams.

The total mass of the solution = Mass of sulfuric acid + Mass of water
= 24.5 grams + 500 grams
= 524.5 grams.

Now, we calculate the density of the solution:
Density = Total Mass / Total Volume
= 524.5 grams / 500 mL
= 1.049 grams per milliliter (g/mL).

Therefore, the density of the solution is approximately 1.049 g/mL.

The volume of the metal sphere is given by (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. The radius of the sphere is half of its diameter, which is 6 cm. So, the radius of the sphere is 3 cm.

The volume of the sphere = (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic cm.

When the sphere is melted to form a cylinder, the volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere. The volume of the cylinder is given by πr²h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.

We know that the height of the cylinder is 4 cm. Let's denote the radius of the cylinder as r. Then, the volume of the cylinder is πr²(4) = 4πr².

Since the volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere, we can set up the equation:
36π = 4πr²

Now, we can solve for r:
r² = 36π / 4π
r² = 9
r = √9 = 3 cm

Now that we have the radius of the cylinder, we can find its curved surface area. The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height.

The curved surface area = 2π(3)(4) = 24π square cm.

Since π is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the curved surface area:
24π ≈ 24 * 3.14159 ≈ 75.39816

In many contexts, especially for precision and following instructions exactly, providing the numerical value directly calculated from given formulas is preferred.

The formula for the curved surface area of the cylinder, given the volume of the sphere equals the volume of the cylinder, leads us directly to the calculation above. The final step simplifies to calculating the area based on the established dimensions.

Therefore, considering the standard approach to such problems and the usual expectation for exact numerical answers in mathematical contexts, we proceed with the calculated result directly.

Now, let's break down the solution:

The formula for gravitational acceleration (g) at a certain height (h) above the Earth's surface is given by:

g = G \* (M / (R + h)^2)

where:
- G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 N m^2 kg^-2)
- M is the mass of the Earth (5.98 x 10^24 kg)
- R is the radius of the Earth (6.37 x 10^6 m)
- h is the height above the Earth's surface (500 km = 5 x 10^5 m)

Plugging in the values:

g = (6.674 x 10^-11) \* (5.98 x 10^24) / ((6.37 x 10^6) + (5 x 10^5))^2
g = (6.674 x 10^-11) \* (5.98 x 10^24) / (6.37 x 10^6 + 0.5 x 10^6)^2
g = (6.674 x 10^-11) \* (5.98 x 10^24) / (6.87 x 10^6)^2
g = (6.674 x 10^-11) \* (5.98 x 10^24) / (47.1619 x 10^12)
g = (6.674 x 10^-11) \* (5.98 x 10^24) / (4.71619 x 10^13)
g = 8.3876 m/s^2

However, to get a more precise answer, considering significant figures and rounding:

g ≈ 8.39 m/s^2 (though the precise calculation yields a value closer to 8.388, for simplicity and instruction clarity, we approximate)

Thus, the gravitational acceleration 500 km above the Earth's surface is approximately 8.39 m/s^2.

The given atmospheric pressure is 93296 Pascals, the density of kerosene is 800 kg/m^3, and the density of benzene is 980 kg/m^3. However, to find the height of a mercury column (which seems to be what's implied by ""পারদ স্তম্ভের উচ্চতা""), we actually need the density of mercury, not kerosene or benzene. The density of mercury is approximately 13600 kg/m^3.

Given the atmospheric pressure (P) and the density of the fluid (ρ), we can calculate the height (h) of the fluid column using the formula derived from the hydrostatic pressure equation: P = ρgh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).

Rearranging the formula to solve for h gives us: h = P / (ρg).

Let's substitute the given atmospheric pressure and the density of mercury into this formula:

h = 93296 Pa / (13600 kg/m^3 * 9.81 m/s^2)

First, calculate the denominator: 13600 kg/m^3 * 9.81 m/s^2 = 133236 kg/m^2s^2 = 133236 Pa/m (since 1 Pa = 1 kg/m*s^2).

Now, divide the pressure by this value to find the height: h = 93296 Pa / 133236 Pa/m ≈ 0.7 m.

Therefore, the height of the mercury column would be approximately 0.7 meters.

""40 grams of sodium metal and 35.5 grams of chlorine gas are placed in a container. After reacting in a suitable environment to produce sodium chloride, how many grams of sodium chloride will be produced?""

The chemical reaction between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) is as follows:

2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl

The molar mass of Na is approximately 23 g/mol, and the molar mass of Cl2 is approximately 71 g/mol (since Cl has a molar mass of about 35.5 g/mol). The molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.5 g/mol (23 g/mol for Na and 35.5 g/mol for Cl).

First, let's calculate the number of moles of sodium and chlorine:

Moles of Na = mass of Na / molar mass of Na = 40 g / 23 g/mol ≈ 1.74 mol
Moles of Cl2 = mass of Cl2 / molar mass of Cl2 = 35.5 g / 71 g/mol ≈ 0.5 mol

Since the reaction requires 2 moles of Na for every 1 mole of Cl2, the limiting reactant in this case is Cl2 because it will be completely consumed first.

From the reaction equation, 1 mole of Cl2 produces 2 moles of NaCl. Since we have 0.5 mol of Cl2, the moles of NaCl produced will be:

Moles of NaCl = 2 * moles of Cl2 = 2 * 0.5 mol = 1 mol

The mass of NaCl produced can be calculated by multiplying the moles of NaCl by its molar mass:

Mass of NaCl = moles of NaCl * molar mass of NaCl = 1 mol * 58.5 g/mol = 58.5 g

Therefore, the amount of sodium chloride produced will be 58.5 grams.

Again, the 14th mark of the Vernier scale coincides with a mark on the main scale. What is the Vernier constant (in mm)?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The main scale's 19 divisions are equal to the Vernier scale's 20 divisions. This means that the least count of the Vernier scale is 19/20 times the least count of the main scale.

2. Since the zero mark of the Vernier scale crosses the 5.2 cm mark of the main scale, and the 14th mark of the Vernier scale coincides with a mark on the main scale, we can set up an equation to find the least count of the Vernier scale.

Let's denote the least count of the main scale as 'x' mm. Then, the 5.2 cm mark on the main scale is equal to 5.2 * 10 = 52 mm.

Since the zero mark of the Vernier scale crosses the 5.2 cm mark, the 14th mark of the Vernier scale coincides with the 52 mm + (19/20 * x) * 14 mark on the main scale. However, this information alone is not sufficient to calculate the Vernier constant directly.

We need to use the fact that the main scale's 19 divisions are equal to the Vernier scale's 20 divisions. The Vernier constant is the difference between the value of one main scale division and the value of one Vernier scale division.

One main scale division is equal to x mm, and one Vernier scale division is equal to (19/20) * x mm.

The Vernier constant is the difference between these two values:
Vernier constant = x - (19/20) * x = (1/20) * x

However, we know that 19 main scale divisions are equal to 20 Vernier scale divisions, and the zero error is 52 mm - (14 * Vernier scale division). But we are not given the exact value of x.

The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of ethanol is:

C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O

Given that we have 1 mole of ethanol (C2H5OH) and 1 mole of oxygen (O2), we need to determine how much water (H2O) is produced from this reaction.

However, according to the balanced equation, 1 mole of ethanol requires 3 moles of oxygen to completely combust. Since we only have 1 mole of oxygen, the reaction will not go to completion as written. Instead, we will have a limiting reactant problem.

The reaction can proceed as follows with the given amounts:

1. With 1 mole of O2, we can only react a portion of the ethanol, since 1 mole of ethanol requires 3 moles of O2 for complete combustion.

Given the stoichiometry, for every mole of ethanol that reacts completely, 3 moles of water are produced (as per the balanced equation). However, since we don't have enough oxygen to react all of the ethanol completely, we need to calculate how much ethanol can react with the available oxygen.

2. Since the question specifically asks for the amount of water produced from 1 mole of ethanol and 1 mole of oxygen, and we know that the combustion of ethanol to produce water requires more oxygen than we have, let's analyze the reaction based on the limiting reagent (oxygen in this case).

For every 3 moles of O2, 2 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O are produced from 1 mole of C2H5OH. Since we only have 1 mole of O2, which is less than the required 3 moles for complete combustion of 1 mole of ethanol, the reaction is limited by the availability of oxygen.

To find out how much water can be produced from 1 mole of oxygen, considering the stoichiometry of the reaction:

- 3 moles of O2 produce 3 moles of H2O.
- Therefore, 1 mole of O2 would produce 1 mole of H2O, since the ratio of O2 to H2O in the balanced equation is 1:"

A typical reaction involving KOH is its reaction with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form potassium chloride (KCl), which is a salt, and water:

KOH + HCl -> KCl + H2O

However, without the specifics of the reaction (like what the other reactant is), we'll assume the question is asking for the mass of the salt produced when all of the KOH reacts, assuming a complete reaction with an appropriate acid to form a salt. 

Given:
- Mass of KOH = 56 grams
- Molar mass of KOH = 56 g/mol (since KOH's molar mass is approximately 56 g/mol, this simplifies calculations)

If we assume the reaction is with HCl to form KCl:
- Molar mass of KCl = 74.55 g/mol (approximately)
- Reaction equation: KOH + HCl -> KCl + H2O

From the equation, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for KOH:KCl, meaning 1 mole of KOH produces 1 mole of KCl.

When an object is thrown upwards, it initially moves away from the ground due to its initial velocity, but it is constantly decelerated by gravity until it reaches its maximum height, at which point its velocity is zero. Then, it starts falling back down, accelerating due to gravity until it hits the ground.

Given:
- Initial velocity (v₀) = 9.8 m/s (upwards)
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s² (downwards)

The time it takes for the object to reach its maximum height can be found using the equation v = v₀ - gt, where v is the final velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height), v₀ is the initial velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time.

3. The total surface area of the cylinder (A) can be calculated using the formula A = 2πr² + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
A = 2π(1)² + 2π(1)(36)
A = 2π + 72π
A = 74π

A ≈ 74 * 3.14
A ≈ 232.36

However, for exactness, we keep the answer in terms of π or provide the numerical value without the approximation of π when not explicitly asked for a decimal approximation.

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states, ""How much copper is needed to prepare 2 liters of 0.1 molar copper solution?""

2. **Solution:**
To find out how much copper is needed, we first need to calculate the number of moles of copper required for 2 liters of a 0.1 molar solution. The molarity of a solution is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. 

Given:
- Molarity (M) = 0.1 moles/liter
- Volume (V) = 2 liters

The number of moles (n) of copper needed can be calculated using the formula:
\[ n = M \times V \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ n = 0.1 \, \text{moles/liter} \times 2 \, \text{liters} = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \]

The atomic mass of copper (Cu) is approximately 63.55 grams/mole. To find the mass of copper needed, we multiply the number of moles by the atomic mass:
\[ \text{Mass of copper} = n \times \text{atomic mass of copper} \]
\[ \text{Mass of copper} = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times 63.55 \, \text{grams/mole} \]
\[ \text{Mass of copper} = 12.71 \, \text{grams} \]

Therefore, the amount of copper needed to prepare 2 liters of 0.1 molar copper solution is approximately 12.71 grams.

A semimolar solution is a solution with a concentration of 0.5 moles of solute per liter of solution. The molecular weight of sodium chloride (NaCl) is 58.44 grams per mole.

Given:
- Volume of the solution (V) = 2 liters
- Desired concentration = 0.5 moles/liter (since it's semimolar)

First, calculate the total moles of NaCl needed for 2 liters of solution to be semimolar:
Moles of NaCl = Desired concentration * Volume of solution
Moles of NaCl = 0.5 moles/liter * 2 liters = 1 mole

Next, calculate the mass of NaCl needed:
Mass of NaCl = Moles of NaCl * Molecular weight of NaCl
Mass of NaCl = 1 mole * 58.44 grams/mole = 58.44 grams

""A 5 kg gun shoots a 20 gram bullet at a speed of 500 m/s for 0.1 seconds. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by the gun on the bullet?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, convert the mass of the bullet to kilograms: 20 grams = 0.02 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 grams).
2. The change in momentum of the bullet (Δp) can be calculated using the formula Δp = m * Δv, where m is the mass of the bullet and Δv is the change in velocity.
3. Since the bullet is initially at rest, its initial velocity (v_i) is 0 m/s. The final velocity (v_f) of the bullet is 500 m/s.
4. Therefore, the change in velocity (Δv) is v_f - v_i = 500 m/s - 0 m/s = 500 m/s.
5. Now, calculate the change in momentum: Δp = m * Δv = 0.02 kg * 500 m/s = 10 kg*m/s.
6. The force exerted by the gun on the bullet (F) can be calculated using the formula F = Δp / Δt, where Δt is the time over which the force is applied.
7. Given that the bullet is shot for 0.1 seconds, we can calculate the force: F = Δp / Δt = 10 kg*m/s / 0.1 s = 100 N.

Therefore, the magnitude of the force exerted by the gun on the bullet is 100 N.

2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

From the equation, we see that 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide.

The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.31 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O2) is approximately 32 g/mol (since oxygen is diatomic, its molecular mass is 2 * 16 = 32 g/mol).

Given that we have 12 grams of magnesium, we first need to find out how many moles of magnesium we have:

Moles of Mg = Mass of Mg / Molar mass of Mg
= 12 g / 24.31 g/mol
≈ 0.493 mol

According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O2. So, for 0.493 mol of Mg, the amount of O2 needed is:

Moles of O2 = Moles of Mg / 2
= 0.493 mol / 2
≈ 0.2465 mol

Now, to find the mass of oxygen that will react with 12 grams of magnesium, we multiply the moles of O2 by the molar mass of O2:

Mass of O2 = Moles of O2 * Molar mass of O2

""750 ml of a 0.125 molar solution of potassium carbonate is prepared. How many grams of carbon dioxide will be produced when hydrochloric acid is added to the solution?""

Now, let's proceed to solve the problem:

The reaction between potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented by the following equation:

K2CO3 + 2HCl -> 2KCl + CO2 + H2O

From the equation, we see that 1 mole of K2CO3 produces 1 mole of CO2.

Given that we have a 0.125 molar solution of K2CO3 in 750 ml, we need to find the number of moles of K2CO3 present:

Number of moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
= 0.125 M * (750 ml / 1000)
= 0.125 M * 0.75 L
= 0.09375 moles

Since 1 mole of K2CO3 produces 1 mole of CO2, the number of moles of CO2 produced will also be 0.09375 moles.

The molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of CO2 produced can be calculated as:

Mass of CO2 = Number of moles * Molar mass
= 0.09375 moles * 44 g/mol
= 4.125 g

Thus, when hydrochloric acid is added to the solution, 4.125 grams of carbon dioxide will be produced.

1 N = 1 kg * a
a = 1 N / 1 kg
a = 1 m/s^2

Since the force is applied for 5 seconds, we can calculate the change in velocity using the equation: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (1 m/s), a is the acceleration (1 m/s^2), and t is the time (5 s).

According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. Since the sphere is half-submerged in water, the weight of the water displaced is equal to half the weight of the sphere.

Given:
- Volume of the sphere (V) = 200 cubic meters
- The sphere is half-submerged in water.

The volume of water displaced by the sphere when it is half-submerged is half the volume of the sphere, because the sphere displaces a volume of water equal to its own submerged volume. 

So, the volume of water displaced = 200 cubic meters / 2 = 100 cubic meters.

The weight of water displaced can be calculated using the density of water. The density of water is approximately 1,000 kg/cubic meter.

Weight of water displaced = Density of water * Volume of water displaced
= 1,000 kg/cubic meter * 100 cubic meters
= 100,000 kg

Since the sphere is in equilibrium (half-submerged and half-out), the weight of the sphere must be equal to the weight of the water it displaces (which is 100,000 kg), due to Archimedes' Principle.

Now, to find the density of the sphere, we divide the weight of the sphere by its volume:

Density of the sphere = Weight of the sphere / Volume of the sphere

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The molecular weight of 10 moles of carbon monoxide is how much?""

2. Calculate the molecular weight of carbon monoxide:
The molecular weight of CO = atomic mass of C + atomic mass of O
The molecular weight of CO = 12 + 16 = 28 units

Since the molecular weight of one mole of CO is 28 grams, the molecular weight of 10 moles of CO would be:
Molecular weight of 10 moles of CO = 10 * molecular weight of one mole of CO
Molecular weight of 10 moles of CO = 10 * 28 = 280 grams

Therefore, the molecular weight of 10 moles of carbon monoxide is 280 grams.

2. **Solution:**
- Main scale reading = 18 mm
- Vernier scale coincidence = 8
- Vernier constant = 0.01 cm = 0.1 mm (since 1 cm = 10 mm)

The vernier constant represents the difference in measurement between one main scale division and one vernier scale division. It is given as 0.01 cm, which we convert to mm for consistency.

To find the actual thickness measured by the vernier calipers, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Actual measurement} = \text{Main scale reading} + (\text{Vernier scale coincidence} \times \text{Vernier constant}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Actual measurement} = 18 \, \text{mm} + (8 \times 0.1 \, \text{mm}) \]
\[ \text{Actual measurement} = 18 \, \text{mm} + 0.8 \, \text{mm} \]

Now, to find the probability of rain on 8th September, we need to consider the total number of days in September and the number of days it rained.

September has 30 days. It is given that it rained for 19 days. The probability of rain on any specific day, given that it rained for 19 out of 30 days, can be calculated as the number of rainy days divided by the total number of days.

However, the question seems to ask for the probability of rain on a specific day (8th September) without providing any additional information that would differentiate this day from any other. Therefore, assuming each day has an equal chance of being one of the rainy days, the probability would simply be the proportion of rainy days to the total number of days in September.

Probability = Number of rainy days / Total number of days in September = 19 / 30

This calculation gives us the proportion of days that it rained out of the total days in September, which can be interpreted as the probability that any given day (like the 8th) would be a rainy day, assuming we have no additional information about the 8th specifically.

Therefore, the probability of rain on 8th September, based on the given data, is 19/30.

""Two objects of 15 kg and 10 kg are moving towards each other on the same road at speeds of 3 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively. After a head-on collision, they stick together. What is their combined speed?""

Now, let's solve the problem. 

When two objects stick together after a collision, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum to find their combined speed. The momentum of an object is given by the product of its mass and velocity. 

Let's denote the combined speed of the two objects after the collision as v. The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. 

Momentum before collision = Momentum of 15 kg object + Momentum of 10 kg object
= 15 kg * 3 m/s + 10 kg * (-5 m/s)  (negative sign indicates opposite direction)
= 45 kg*m/s - 50 kg*m/s
= -5 kg*m/s

Momentum after collision = (15 kg + 10 kg) * v
= 25 kg * v

Since momentum is conserved, we can equate the momentum before and after the collision:

-5 kg*m/s = 25 kg * v

Now, solve for v:

v = -5 kg*m/s / 25 kg
= -0.2 m/s

The negative sign indicates that the combined object moves in the direction of the 10 kg object (since it had a greater speed). However, we are only interested in the magnitude of the speed.

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states that an object of 2 kg mass, when dropped from above, covers a distance of 36 meters in 3 seconds. We are asked to find the acceleration of the object in m/s^2.""

Given:
- Distance covered (s) = 36 meters
- Time taken (t) = 3 seconds
- Mass (m) = 2 kg (though mass is not directly needed to calculate acceleration in this context)

The formula to find distance covered under constant acceleration (a) is:
s = ut + 0.5at^2

Since the object starts from rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s. Thus, the formula simplifies to:
s = 0.5at^2

Rearranging the formula to solve for acceleration (a):
a = 2s / t^2

Plugging in the given values:
a = (2 * 36) / (3)^2
a = 72 / 9
a = 8 m/s^2

Therefore, the acceleration of the object is 8 m/s^2.

1. **Translation of the problem:** The problem asks for the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid.

2. **Calculating the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid:**

The molecular formula of chloric acid is HClO3. 

- The atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 u.
- The atomic mass of Chlorine (Cl) is approximately 35.5 u.
- The atomic mass of Oxygen (O) is approximately 16 u.

The molar mass of HClO3 = 1 (for H) + 35.5 (for Cl) + 3*16 (for three O atoms) = 1 + 35.5 + 48 = 84.5 u.

The total mass of oxygen in HClO3 = 3*16 = 48 u.

To find the percentage of oxygen, we use the formula: (mass of oxygen in the compound / molar mass of the compound) * 100.

Percentage of oxygen = (48 / 84.5) * 100.

Calculating the percentage: (48 / 84.5) * 100 ≈ 56.79%.

""Translate the problem: In a right-angled triangle, the base and hypotenuse are 12 and 13 respectively. What is the height?""

Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides, we can find the height (let's denote the height as 'h'). The formula is \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\), where \(c\) is the hypotenuse, \(a\) is the base, and \(b\) is the height.

Given that the base (\(a\)) is 12 and the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is 13, we can plug these values into the formula:

\(13^2 = 12^2 + h^2\)

Calculating the squares:

\(169 = 144 + h^2\)

Subtract 144 from both sides to isolate \(h^2\):

\(h^2 = 169 - 144\)

\(h^2 = 25\)

Taking the square root of both sides to solve for \(h\):

\(h = \sqrt{25}\)

\(h = 5\)

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that there is a spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters, and it is half-submerged in water. We need to find the buoyancy of the sphere.

2. **Understanding Buoyancy:**
According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyancy (or upward force) exerted on an object immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid the object displaces. For an object that is partially submerged, the weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object if it were fully submerged up to the point of flotation.

3. **Calculating the Volume Submerged:**
Since the sphere is half-submerged, the volume of the sphere that is underwater is half of its total volume.
\[ \text{Submerged Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \, \text{cubic meters} = 100 \, \text{cubic meters} \]

4. **Buoyancy Calculation:**
The buoyancy (B) is equal to the weight of the water displaced. The weight of water is approximately 1000 kilograms per cubic meter. Therefore, the weight of the water displaced by 100 cubic meters of the sphere is:
\[ B = 100 \, \text{cubic meters} \times 1000 \, \text{kg/cubic meter} = 100,000 \, \text{kg} \]
To convert this into Newtons (since 1 kgf = 9.81 N), we multiply by the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2):
\[ B = 100,000 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 981,000 \, \text{N} \]

However, given that buoyancy is typically discussed in terms of the volume of fluid displaced and not necessarily requiring conversion into force (Newtons) for a basic understanding of ""plabata"" as asked, the key figure is the volume of water displaced or the concept that the buoyant force equals the weight of the fluid displaced.
