The problem states that a freely falling object covers a distance of 72 meters in 6 seconds. We need to find out how much distance it will cover in 3 seconds.

## Step 2: Understand the concept of free fall and the formula for distance covered.
In free fall, the distance covered by an object is directly proportional to the square of the time taken. The formula for distance (d) covered under free fall is given by d = (1/2)gt^2, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2) and t is the time taken.

## Step 3: Calculate the distance covered in 3 seconds using the given information and the formula for free fall.
However, since we already know the distance covered in 6 seconds, we can use the proportionality of the distance to the square of the time to find the distance covered in 3 seconds without directly using the value of g. The ratio of distances will be the square of the ratio of times.

## Step 4: Apply the proportionality to find the distance covered in 3 seconds.
Given that in 6 seconds the object covers 72 meters, we can find the distance covered in 3 seconds by using the ratio of the times squared: (3/6)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. This means the object will cover 1/4 of the distance it covers in 6 seconds in 3 seconds.

## Step 5: Calculate the distance covered in 3 seconds.
Distance in 3 seconds = 72 meters * (1/4) = 18 meters.

The problem states that in February 2000, it rained for 5 days. We need to find the probability that it rained on February 12th.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of days in February 2000.
February 2000 has 29 days, since 2000 is a leap year.

## Step 3: Calculate the probability of raining on a specific day.
Given that it rained for 5 days out of the 29 days in February, we can calculate the probability of it raining on any given day. However, to find the probability that it rained on February 12th specifically, we must consider that the problem does not provide information on how the rainy days are distributed throughout the month.

## Step 4: Consider the nature of the problem.
The problem essentially asks for the probability of a specific day being one of the rainy days, without providing the specific dates of the rainy days. Since we know it rained on 5 out of 29 days, but not which specific days, the probability that February 12th was one of those days can be considered as the ratio of the number of rainy days to the total number of days in February.

## Step 5: Calculate the probability.
The probability that it rained on February 12th is the number of rainy days (5) divided by the total number of days in February (29).

## Step 6: Perform the calculation.
Probability = Number of rainy days / Total number of days = 5 / 29.

The problem states: ""If an object is released from a fixed position without any obstacles, how many times will its velocity increase when it covers four times the distance?""

## Step 2: Understand the physical principles involved.
The object is under the sole influence of gravity, assuming no air resistance or other external forces. As it falls, its velocity increases due to the acceleration caused by gravity.

## Step 3: Recall the equation of motion under constant acceleration.
The equation that relates initial velocity (v_i), final velocity (v_f), initial position (s_i), final position (s_f), acceleration (a), and time (t) is: v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a(s_f - s_i). Since the object is released from rest, v_i = 0.

## Step 4: Apply the equation to the given scenario.
Let's denote the initial distance as s and the final distance as 4s (four times the initial distance). The acceleration due to gravity is 'g'. We want to find how the velocity changes when the distance increases fourfold.

## Step 5: Calculate the final velocity at distance s.
At distance s, using v_i = 0, the equation simplifies to: v_f^2 = 2gs.

## Step 6: Calculate the final velocity at distance 4s.
At distance 4s, the equation becomes: v_f_new^2 = 2g(4s) = 8gs.

## Step 7: Compare the velocities at s and 4s.
To find how many times the velocity increases, we compare v_f_new to v_f. Since v_f^2 = 2gs and v_f_new^2 = 8gs, taking the square root of both sides gives v_f_new = sqrt(8gs) and v_f = sqrt(2gs).

## Step 8: Calculate the ratio of the new velocity to the original velocity.
The ratio is v_f_new / v_f = sqrt(8gs) / sqrt(2gs) = sqrt(8/2) = sqrt(4) = 2.

The problem asks for the percentage of oxygen in glucose.

## Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of glucose.
The molecular formula of glucose is C6H12O6, which means one molecule of glucose consists of 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar mass of glucose.
To find the percentage of oxygen in glucose, we first need to calculate the molar mass of glucose. The atomic masses are approximately: Carbon (C) = 12 g/mol, Hydrogen (H) = 1 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol. So, the molar mass of glucose = (6 * 12) + (12 * 1) + (6 * 16) = 72 + 12 + 96 = 180 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the total mass of oxygen in one mole of glucose.
Since there are 6 oxygen atoms in one molecule of glucose, the total mass of oxygen in one mole of glucose = 6 * 16 = 96 g.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage of oxygen in glucose.
The percentage of oxygen in glucose = (mass of oxygen in one mole of glucose / molar mass of glucose) * 100 = (96 / 180) * 100.

## Step 6: Perform the calculation for the percentage of oxygen.
(96 / 180) * 100 = 0.5333 * 100 = 53.33%.

The problem states that a car's wheel has a diameter of 0.8 meters and the wheel rotates 6 times per second. We need to find the speed of the car in kilometers per hour.

## Step 2: Calculate the circumference of the wheel.
The circumference of a circle (such as the car's wheel) can be calculated using the formula: circumference = π * diameter. Given the diameter is 0.8 meters, we can calculate the circumference as follows: circumference = π * 0.8.

## Step 3: Perform the calculation of the circumference.
Using the value of π as approximately 3.14159, the circumference = 3.14159 * 0.8 = 2.51327 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the distance covered by the wheel in one second.
Since the wheel rotates 6 times per second, the distance covered in one second is the circumference multiplied by the number of rotations: distance per second = 6 * circumference.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation of the distance covered in one second.
Using the calculated circumference from Step 3, the distance per second = 6 * 2.51327 = 15.07962 meters.

## Step 6: Convert the distance covered per second into kilometers per hour.
To convert meters per second into kilometers per hour, we multiply by 3.6 (since 1 meter per second equals 3.6 kilometers per hour): speed in km/h = distance per second * 3.6.

## Step 7: Perform the calculation to find the speed in kilometers per hour.
Using the distance per second from Step 5, the speed = 15.07962 * 3.6 = 54.28662 km/h.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. We need to find the radius of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Identify the volume of the sphere
The volume of a sphere (V) can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Given that the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can calculate its volume as V = (4/3)π(6)³.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the sphere
Substitute the value of r into the formula: V = (4/3)π(6)³ = (4/3) * 3.14159 * 216 = 904.7786842338604 cm³.

## Step 4: Identify the volume of the cylinder
The volume of a cylinder (V) can be calculated using the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius of the cylinder's base and h is the height of the cylinder. Given that the height of the cylinder is 32 cm, we can set up the equation as 904.7786842338604 = πr² * 32.

## Step 5: Solve for the radius of the cylinder
Rearrange the equation to solve for r: r² = 904.7786842338604 / (π * 32) = 904.7786842338604 / (3.14159 * 32) = 904.7786842338604 / 100.53 = 9.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 32 cm. We need to find the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Determine the volume of the original sphere to find the volume of the cylinder.
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. Given that the radius \(r = 6\) cm, we can calculate the volume of the sphere: \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (216) = 288\pi\).

## Step 3: Use the volume of the sphere to find the radius of the cylinder.
The volume of the cylinder, which is equal to the volume of the sphere, is given by \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. Given that \(h = 32\) cm and \(V = 288\pi\), we can solve for \(r\): \(288\pi = \pi r^2 (32)\). Simplifying this equation gives \(288 = 32r^2\), and solving for \(r^2\) yields \(r^2 = \frac{288}{32} = 9\). Therefore, \(r = 3\) cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder.
The curved surface area \(A\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \(A = 2\pi rh\), where \(r\) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. Given that \(r = 3\) cm and \(h = 32\) cm, we can calculate the curved surface area: \(A = 2\pi (3)(32) = 192\pi\).

## Step 5: Calculate the numerical value of the curved surface area.
To find the numerical value, we use the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\). However, since the format requires a boxed numerical answer, we'll keep the answer in terms of \(\pi\) for precision and then calculate the exact numerical value"

The problem states that a force of 22 Newtons is applied to a 10 kg stationary object for 10 seconds. The object is moving on a surface with a frictional force of 2 Newtons. We need to find the velocity of the object after 10 seconds.

## Step 2: Calculate the net force acting on the object
To find the net force acting on the object, we subtract the frictional force from the applied force. Net force (F) = Applied force - Frictional force = 22 N - 2 N = 20 N.

## Step 3: Use Newton's second law to find the acceleration of the object
According to Newton's second law, the force (F) acting on an object is equal to its mass (m) multiplied by its acceleration (a). Mathematically, F = ma. We can rearrange this formula to find the acceleration: a = F / m. Plugging in the values, a = 20 N / 10 kg = 2 m/s^2.

## Step 4: Use the equation of motion to find the velocity of the object
Since the object starts from rest (initial velocity = 0 m/s), we can use the equation v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time. Plugging in the values, v = 0 + 2 m/s^2 * 10 s = 20 m/s.

The Vernier constant is the difference between the values of one division on the main scale and one division on the Vernier scale. It is also known as the least count of the Vernier caliper.

## Step 3: Determine the least count of the main scale
Let's assume the least count of the main scale is 1 cm (or 10 mm), which is a common value for many measuring instruments.

## Step 4: Calculate the value of 9 divisions on the main scale
Since 1 division on the main scale is 1 cm, 9 divisions on the main scale would be 9 * 1 = 9 cm.

The problem states: ""When two dice are tossed independently, what is the probability that the same number does not appear on the top face of both dice?""

## Step 2: Identify the total possible outcomes when two dice are tossed
Each die has 6 faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so when two dice are tossed, the total number of outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes where the same number appears on both dice
There are 6 scenarios where the numbers on both dice are the same: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6).

## Step 4: Determine the number of outcomes where the same number does not appear on both dice
To find the number of outcomes where the numbers are not the same, we subtract the number of outcomes where they are the same from the total number of outcomes. So, 36 total outcomes - 6 outcomes where the numbers are the same = 30 outcomes where the numbers are not the same.

## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the same number does not appear on both dice
The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (where the numbers are not the same) by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability = 30 / 36 = 5/6.

## Step 4: Calculate the circumference
Substitute the value of d into the formula: C = π * 0.20.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation
C = 3.14159 * 0.20 = 0.628318 meters.

## Step 6: Round the answer appropriately if necessary
For practical purposes, we can round this to two decimal places, but since the question does not specify, we will provide the answer with a higher precision as calculated.

The problem states that the difference in the circumference of two wheels is 120 cm, and we need to find the difference in their radii.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle.
The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
Let's denote the radius of the larger wheel as R and the radius of the smaller wheel as r. The difference in their circumferences is given as 2πR - 2πr = 120 cm.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation.
We can factor out 2π from the equation: 2π(R - r) = 120 cm.

## Step 5: Solve for the difference in radii (R - r).
To find the difference in radii, we need to isolate (R - r). Divide both sides of the equation by 2π: R - r = 120 cm / (2π).

## Step 6: Calculate the numerical value.
Now, calculate the value of R - r using the approximate value of π as 3.14159: R - r = 120 cm / (2 * 3.14159) = 120 cm / 6.28318.

The problem states that Lincoln has a box of toys where each toy represents a number in the binary number system. Additionally, Lincoln's siblings have 6 more boxes of toys. We need to find out how many toys they have in total.

## Step 2: Determine the number of toys in Lincoln's box
Since each toy represents a binary number, we need to find out how many unique binary numbers can be represented. Binary numbers start from 0 and can go up to any value depending on the number of bits used. However, the problem does not specify the number of bits, so we will assume a basic understanding of binary where we count from 0 to the highest number that can be represented with a certain number of bits, typically starting with a single bit (0, 1) and expanding to more bits.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique binary numbers for a common reference
For simplicity and without loss of generality, if we consider a binary system with n bits, the total unique numbers (including 0 and excluding the number that would require n+1 bits) is 2^n. However, without a specified number of bits or toys, we can consider a basic scenario such as 3 bits, which gives us 2^3 = 8 unique numbers (0 through 7), each theoretically represented by a toy. But, since we don't have a specific number of bits mentioned, we must consider the question might imply a simpler or direct count of binary numbers commonly known.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of ""binary number system"" in the context of toys
Given the context, the problem seems to imply a count of toys based on binary representation but does not specify the range or the number of bits. Typically, in basic discussions, binary numbers are counted from 0 to a certain value. For educational purposes, counts often start with smaller sets. Without specific details, assuming a count that includes 0 and the first few binary numbers (1, 10, 11, 100, etc.) might be what's implied, but this does not directly lead to a specific count without more information.

## Step 5: Address the lack of specificity in the problem statement
The problem lacks specificity about the range of binary numbers or the exact count of toys. Normally, when discussing binary numbers in an educational or simple context, one might start with the basics (0, 1, 10, 11"

The problem states: ""When 200 grams of limestone is heated in an open vessel, what amount of calcium oxide will be obtained?""

## Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction involved
Limestone is primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). When calcium carbonate is heated in an open vessel, it undergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon! dioxide (CO2). The chemical equation for this reaction is: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar mass of calcium carbonate and calcium oxide
The molar mass of CaCO3 is approximately 100 g/mol (40 for Ca, 12 for C, and 48 for 3O). The molar mass of CaO is approximately 56 g/mol (40 for Ca and 16 for O).

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reagent and calculate the amount of calcium oxide produced
Given that we start with 200 grams of CaCO3, we first convert this mass to moles to understand how many moles of CaO can be produced. Moles of CaCO3 = mass of CaCO3 / molar mass of CaCO3 = 200 g / 100 g/mol = 2 mol. According to the chemical equation, 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of CaO. Therefore, 2 moles of CaCO3 will produce 2 moles of CaO.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of calcium oxide produced
To find the mass of CaO produced, we multiply the number of moles of CaO by the molar mass of CaO. Mass of CaO = moles of CaO * molar mass of CaO = 2 mol * 56 g/mol = 112 g.

The problem states that an object with a mass of 8 kg, placed on a surface, experiences a force of 30 Newtons applied to it, resulting in an acceleration of 3 m/s^2. We need to find the frictional force between the object and the surface.

## Step 2: Identify the forces acting on the object and the acceleration.
The forces acting on the object are the applied force (30 N) and the frictional force (which we need to find). The object experiences an acceleration of 3 m/s^2 due to these forces.

## Step 3: Apply Newton's second law of motion to relate forces and acceleration.
Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F_net = m * a). Since the object is moving, the net force is the difference between the applied force and the frictional force.

## Step 4: Calculate the net force acting on the object.
Given that the mass (m) is 8 kg and the acceleration (a) is 3 m/s^2, we can calculate the net force using F_net = m * a = 8 kg * 3 m/s^2 = 24 N.

## Step 5: Determine the frictional force.
Since the net force is the difference between the applied force and the frictional force, we can write the equation as: Applied Force - Frictional Force = Net Force. Substituting the known values gives us 30 N - Frictional Force = 24 N.

## Step 6: Solve for the frictional force.
Rearrange the equation to solve for the frictional force: Frictional Force = Applied Force - Net Force = 30 N - 24 N = 6 N.

The problem states: ""The diameter of a circle is 9 cm. What is the central angle subtended by a 15 cm long arc of the circle?""

## Step 2: Calculate the radius of the circle.
Given that the diameter of the circle is 9 cm, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2. So, the radius (r) is 9 / 2 = 4.5 cm.

## Step 3: Recall the formula for the arc length of a circle.
The formula for the arc length (L) of a circle is L = θ × (π × r) / 180, where θ is the central angle in degrees, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. However, since we are given the arc length and need to find the central angle, we will rearrange this formula to solve for θ.

## Step 4: Rearrange the formula to solve for the central angle θ.
Rearranging the formula L = θ × (π × r) / 180 to solve for θ gives us θ = (L × 180) / (π × r).

## Step 5: Substitute the given values into the rearranged formula.
Substituting L = 15 cm, r = 4.5 cm, and π ≈ 3.14159 into the formula θ = (L × 180) / (π × r) gives us θ = (15 × 180) / (3.14159 × 4.5).

## Step 6: Perform the calculation to find the central angle θ.
Calculating θ = (15 × 180) / (3.14159 × 4.5) gives us θ = 2700 / (3.14159 × 4.5) = 2700 / 14.137355 = 190.977 degrees, approximately. However, we need to ensure our calculation is correct and follows the proper formula application.

## Step 7: Correct the calculation approach.
To find the central angle, we actually use the formula θ = (L / r) × (180 / π), where L is the arc length and r is the radius. Substituting the given values, we get θ = (15 / 4.5) × (180 / π).

## Step 8: Perform the correct calculation.

The problem states: ""A coin is tossed 750 times and heads come up 300 times. What is the relative frequency of heads?""

## Step 2: Define relative frequency.
Relative frequency is the ratio of the number of times an event occurs to the total number of trials. In this case, it's the number of times heads come up divided by the total number of coin tosses.

## Step 3: Calculate the relative frequency of heads.
To find the relative frequency of heads, we divide the number of times heads come up (300) by the total number of coin tosses (750).

## Step 4: Perform the calculation.
Relative frequency of heads = Number of heads / Total number of tosses = 300 / 750.

## Step 5: Simplify the fraction.
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 750. The GCD of 300 and 750 is 150. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD: (300 / 150) / (750 / 150) = 2 / 5.

## Step 6: Convert the fraction to a decimal if necessary.
Since the question asks for the relative frequency and does not specify the form of the answer, the fraction 2/5 is an appropriate representation of the relative frequency. However, if a decimal is preferred, we can calculate it: 2 / 5 = 0.4.

The problem states that in a hydraulic press, the smaller piston has an area of 5 square centimeters and the larger piston has an area of 25 square centimeters. When a force of 100 Newtons is applied to the smaller piston, we need to find out how much force will be exerted on the larger piston.

## Step 2: Understand the principle of hydraulic presses
Hydraulic presses work on the principle of Pascal's law, which states that the pressure applied to a fluid in a closed system is transmitted equally in all directions. Since the fluid is incompressible, the pressure applied to the smaller piston is transmitted to the larger piston. The force exerted on the larger piston can be calculated using the principle that the pressure (force per unit area) is constant throughout the system.

## Step 3: Calculate the pressure applied to the smaller piston
The pressure (P) applied to the smaller piston can be calculated using the formula P = F/A, where F is the force applied (100 Newtons) and A is the area of the smaller piston (5 square centimeters). So, P = 100 / 5 = 20 Newtons per square centimeter.

## Step 4: Calculate the force exerted on the larger piston
Since the pressure is constant throughout the system, the pressure applied to the larger piston is also 20 Newtons per square centimeter. The force (F) exerted on the larger piston can be calculated using the formula F = P * A, where P is the pressure (20 Newtons per square centimeter) and A is the area of the larger piston (25 square centimeters). So, F = 20 * 25 = 500 Newtons.

The problem states that a wheel travels 250 meters on a circular path by making 35 revolutions. We need to find the radius of the wheel.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the circumference of the wheel and the distance traveled.
The distance traveled by the wheel in one revolution is equal to the circumference of the wheel. Since the wheel makes 35 revolutions to travel 250 meters, we can set up a relationship between the circumference of the wheel and the total distance traveled.

## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the wheel.
Let's denote the circumference of the wheel as C. The total distance traveled (250 meters) is equal to the circumference of the wheel multiplied by the number of revolutions (35). So, we have the equation: 250 = 35C.

## Step 4: Solve for the circumference of the wheel.
To find the circumference of the wheel (C), we divide both sides of the equation by 35. This gives us: C = 250 / 35.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of the circumference.
Performing the division, we get: C = 7.1429 meters (approximately).

## Step 6: Use the formula for the circumference of a circle to find the radius.
The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the radius: r = C / (2π).

## Step 7: Substitute the value of the circumference into the formula and calculate the radius.
Substituting the value of C (7.1429 meters) into the formula, we get: r = 7.1429 / (2π).

## Step 8: Perform the calculation to find the radius.
Using the approximate value of π as 3.1416, we calculate: r = 7.1429 / (2*3.1416) = 7.1429 / 6.2832.

The problem states that a woman's weight is 40 kg when she is wearing shoes, the area of the sole of her shoe is 200 square centimeters, and her body area is 1.5 square meters. We need to find the pressure exerted when she stands on one foot.

## Step 2: Convert the area of the shoe sole from square centimeters to square meters.
To maintain consistent units, we convert 200 square centimeters to square meters. Since 1 square meter = 10,000 square centimeters, 200 square centimeters = 0.02 square meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the force exerted by the woman when standing on one foot.
The force exerted is equal to the woman's weight. Given that weight (W) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration due to gravity (g), and assuming g = 9.81 m/s^2, we can calculate the force. However, since the weight is given directly as 40 kg, we first need to clarify that this is a mass. The force (or weight) exerted by the woman is thus F = m * g = 40 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 392.4 N.

## Step 4: Calculate the pressure exerted when the woman stands on one foot.
Pressure (P) is calculated by dividing the force (F) by the area (A) over which the force is applied. Thus, P = F / A. Given that the area of one shoe sole is 0.02 square meters, the pressure is P = 392.4 N / 0.02 m^2 = 19620 Pascals.

The problem states that 5 grams of hydrogen gas are passed into 75 grams of chlorine gas. We need to find out how many moles of hydrogen are left after the reaction.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine
The reaction between hydrogen (H2) and chlorine (Cl2) produces hydrochloric acid (HCl) or hydrogen chloride. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:
H2 + Cl2 -> 2HCl

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of hydrogen and chlorine
To find the number of moles of hydrogen and chlorine, we use the formula: moles = mass / molar mass.
The molar mass of hydrogen (H2) is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 71 grams/mole.
Moles of hydrogen = mass of hydrogen / molar mass of hydrogen = 5 g / 2 g/mole = 2.5 moles.
Moles of chlorine = mass of chlorine / molar mass of chlorine = 75 g / 71 g/mole ≈ 1.056 moles.

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant
From the balanced equation, we see that 1 mole of hydrogen reacts with 1 mole of chlorine. Since there are 2.5 moles of hydrogen and approximately 1.056 moles of chlorine, chlorine is the limiting reactant because it has fewer moles than hydrogen.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of hydrogen that reacts with chlorine
Since chlorine is the limiting reactant and 1 mole of hydrogen reacts with 1 mole of chlorine, the amount of hydrogen that reacts is equal to the amount of chlorine present, which is approximately 1.056 moles.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of hydrogen left after the reaction
Initial moles of hydrogen = 2.5 moles.
Moles of hydrogen that react = 1.056 moles (since it reacts with all the chlorine).
Moles of hydrogen left = Initial moles of hydrogen - Moles of hydrogen that react = 2.5 moles - 1.056 moles ≈ 1.444 moles.

## Step 2: Determine the molar mass of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to calculate the number of moles.
The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 grams per mole (23 grams for Na and 17 grams for OH, plus 1 gram for H, but since we're considering the compound as a whole, the hydrogen's mass is included in the total molar mass calculation as part of the hydroxide ion, so it's 40 grams/mole).

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide.
Given 0.4 grams of NaOH, we use the formula moles = mass / molar mass to find the number of moles. So, moles = 0.4 grams / 40 grams/mole = 0.01 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the solution in moles per liter (molarity).
The volume of the solution is given as 100 milliliters, which is 0.1 liters. Molarity (M) is calculated using the formula M = moles / liters. So, M = 0.01 moles / 0.1 liters = 0.1 M.

## Step 5: Convert the molarity to grams per 100 milliliters if necessary for the final answer.
Since we've already found the molarity and the question asks for concentration without specifying units other than implying a need for a numerical value, we can use the molarity as our final measure of concentration.

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s. Therefore, 54 km/h = 54 * (5/18) m/s = 15 m/s.

## Step 3: Identify the known parameters.
- Initial speed (u) = 15 m/s
- Final speed (v) = 0 m/s (since the car stops)
- Distance traveled (s) = 46 - 1 = 45 meters (since the car stops 1 meter in front of the pedestrian)

## Step 4: Apply the equation of motion to find the acceleration.
The equation of motion is v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance traveled. Since v = 0, the equation simplifies to 0 = u^2 + 2as.

## Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for acceleration (a).
0 = u^2 + 2as
-u^2 = 2as
a = -u^2 / (2s)

## Step 6: Calculate the acceleration using the given values.
a = -(15)^2 / (2 * 45)
a = -225 / 90
a = -2.5 m/s^2

## Step 7: Interpret the result.
The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction to the initial velocity, which is expected since the car is decelerating. The magnitude of the acceleration is 2.5 m/s^2.

The final answer is: **2.5**"

The problem states that Lincoln has a toy box containing toys representing numbers in the binary number system. Additionally, Lincoln's siblings have 11 more toy boxes. We need to determine the total number of toys they have.

## Step 2: Understand the binary number system representation.
In the binary number system, each digit can be either 0 or 1. To represent numbers in binary, we use powers of 2. The rightmost digit represents 2^0, the next digit to the left represents 2^1, then 2^2, and so on.

## Step 3: Determine the number of toys in Lincoln's box.
Since each toy represents a binary number, we start with the smallest binary numbers: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, and so on. However, the problem does not specify the range of numbers. Assuming Lincoln has toys for all possible binary combinations up to a certain point, we would need to know the maximum value to calculate the exact number of toys in his box.

## Step 4: Consider the maximum binary value represented.
For simplicity, if we consider the first 8 binary numbers (0 to 7, or 000 to 111 in binary), there would be 8 toys in Lincoln's box, representing each of these numbers.

## Step 5: Calculate the total number of toys including Lincoln's siblings'.
The problem mentions Lincoln's siblings have 11 more toy boxes, but it does not specify the contents. Assuming each of these boxes also contains a set of toys representing binary numbers similar to Lincoln's, and if we take the simplest case where each box has the same number of toys as Lincoln's, we could estimate the total. However, without knowing the exact contents or the range of binary numbers each box represents, we can only assume.

## Step 6: Consider the binary representation implication.
Given the lack of specificity about the range of binary numbers each box represents, we might interpret the problem as asking for the number of unique binary representations possible, assuming each box contains a unique set of binary number representations.

## Step 7: Estimate based on minimal interpretation.
If Lincoln's box and each of his siblings' boxes contain a unique set of binary representations (for example, the first box contains 0 and 1, the next contains 00, 01, 10, 11, etc.), we"

The problem states that 64 grams of oxygen are used to produce sodium oxide by adding 46 grams of sodium. We need to find out how much oxygen is left over after this reaction.

## Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction involved.
The reaction between sodium (Na) and oxygen (O2) to form sodium oxide (Na2O) is: 4Na + O2 -> 2Na2O.

## Step 3: Calculate the amount of oxygen required to react with the given amount of sodium.
First, we need to calculate the molar masses of sodium (Na) and oxygen (O2). The molar mass of Na is approximately 23 g/mol, and the molar mass of O2 is approximately 32 g/mol. The molar mass of Na2O is approximately 62 g/mol (2*23 + 16).

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant.
To find out how much oxygen is required to react with 46 grams of sodium, we calculate the number of moles of sodium: moles_of_sodium = mass_of_sodium / molar_mass_of_sodium = 46 / 23 = 2 moles. According to the reaction equation, 4 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of oxygen. So, for 2 moles of sodium, we need 0.5 moles of oxygen (since 2 moles of sodium would require half of the oxygen needed for 4 moles of sodium).

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of oxygen required.
The mass of oxygen required = moles_of_oxygen * molar_mass_of_oxygen = 0.5 * 32 = 16 grams.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of oxygen left over.
Initially, there were 64 grams of oxygen. After using 16 grams for the reaction, the amount of oxygen left over = initial_oxygen - oxygen_used = 64 - 16 = 48 grams.

## Step 2: Identify the chemical formula of ammonia.
Ammonia's chemical formula is NH3, which means it consists of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic weights of nitrogen and hydrogen.
The atomic weight of nitrogen (N) is approximately 14.01 g/mol, and the atomic weight of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.01 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of one mole of ammonia.
To find the molecular weight of ammonia, we add the atomic weight of one nitrogen atom to three times the atomic weight of hydrogen: 14.01 g/mol (for N) + 3 * 1.01 g/mol (for H) = 14.01 + 3.03 = 17.04 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculate the total weight of 12 moles of ammonia.
Since the molecular weight of one mole of ammonia is 17.04 g/mol, the weight of 12 moles of ammonia would be 12 * 17.04 g/mol = 204.48 g.

The problem states: ""A body is tied with a thread and rotated once on a vertical plane, what amount of work is done in joules?""

## Step 2: Understand the concept of work done in the context of the problem.
Work done is typically calculated as the product of the force applied and the distance over which the force is applied, in the direction of the force. However, in the context of rotating an object tied to a thread, we must consider if any actual work is done against a force like gravity or friction when the rotation is on a vertical plane.

## Step 3: Determine the forces at play and the work done.
When an object is rotated on a vertical plane, the primary force to consider would be gravity. However, work done against gravity is typically calculated when there's a change in the object's height. In a rotational motion around a fixed point (like the end of a thread), the object's height may change if we're considering a non-uniform rotation or a pivoting motion around a point not on the object itself. Yet, the problem seems to focus on a simple rotation without specifying any change in height or detailing the forces involved beyond the rotation itself.

## Step 4: Consider the work done in rotating an object.
In a general sense, the work done in rotating an object (W) can be related to the torque (τ) and the angle of rotation (θ) by the formula W = τθ. However, without specific details on the torque applied (which would depend on the force and the radius of rotation), we cannot directly calculate the work done.

## Step 5: Analyze the problem for potential misconceptions or missing details.
Given the problem's description, it seems to lack specific details necessary for a quantitative analysis, such as the mass of the object, the radius of rotation, or any forces applied beyond the implicit force of gravity. Without these, we cannot directly apply formulas to calculate work done.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on provided information.
Given the information provided and the typical interpretation of such problems, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a lack of necessary details to calculate the work done in joules directly from the problem statement as presented.

The problem states that 5 grams of coke (carbon) and 5 grams of oxygen react to form carbon dioxide. We need to find out how many grams of coke will be left after the reaction is complete.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between carbon and oxygen to form carbon dioxide.
The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is: C + O2 -> CO2.

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of carbon (C), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) to understand the stoichiometry of the reaction.
The molar mass of C is approximately 12 grams/mole, the molar mass of O2 is approximately 32 grams/mole, and the molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 grams/mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of carbon and oxygen available for the reaction.
Moles of C = mass of C / molar mass of C = 5 grams / 12 grams/mole = approximately 0.4167 moles.
Moles of O2 = mass of O2 / molar mass of O2 = 5 grams / 32 grams/mole = approximately 0.15625 moles.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio from the balanced equation to the moles available.
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of C reacts with 1 mole of O2. Since there are 0.4167 moles of C and 0.15625 moles of O2, O2 is the limiting reactant because it has fewer moles than C, and the reaction requires a 1:1 ratio.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of carbon that will react with the available oxygen.
Since O2 is the limiting reactant and the reaction requires a 1:1 mole ratio, the amount of C that will react is equal to the moles of O2 available, which is 0.15625 moles.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of water in the pond when it is half full.
To find the pressure, we first need to calculate the volume of water in the pond. Since the pond is half full, the volume of water will be half the total volume of the pond. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. So, the total volume of the pond is 30 * 20 * 3 = 1800 cubic meters. When half full, the volume of water is 1800 / 2 = 900 cubic meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the height of the water column when the pond is half full.
Since the pond is half full, the height of the water column will be half the height of the pond, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the pressure at the bottom of the pond using the formula P = ρgh.
The pressure at the bottom of the pond can be calculated using the formula P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m^3), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height of the water column.

We can use the equation v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity (the velocity at which the object hits the ground), u is the initial velocity (0, since the object is dropped from rest), a is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and s is the distance over which the object falls (100 meters).

## Step 4: Substitute the given values into the equation.
Substituting u = 0, a = 9.81 m/s^2, and s = 100 meters into the equation gives us v^2 = 0^2 + 2 * 9.81 * 100.

## Step 5: Solve for v.
Solving for v, we get v^2 = 0 + 1962, so v^2 = 1962. Taking the square root of both sides gives us v = sqrt(1962).

## Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of v.
Calculating the square root of 1962 gives us approximately 44.27 m/s.

The final answer is: **44.27**"

The problem states that there is a circle with a radius of 2.0 cm, and an arc within this circle subtends an angle of 180 degrees at the center. We need to find the approximate length of this arc.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating the length of an arc of a circle.
The formula for the length of an arc is given by: arc length = (θ/360) * 2 * π * r, where θ is the angle subtended by the arc at the center of the circle in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula to find the arc length.

## Step 2: Understand the composition of water.
Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, with the chemical formula H2O. This means one molecule of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic masses of hydrogen and oxygen.
The atomic mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 u (unified atomic mass unit), and the atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 u.

## Step 4: Calculate the total mass of a water molecule.
Since a water molecule (H2O) consists of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom, the total mass of a water molecule is (2*1) + 16 = 2 + 16 = 18 u.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of hydrogen in a water molecule.
The mass of hydrogen in a water molecule is 2*1 = 2 u, since there are two hydrogen atoms.

## Step 6: Calculate the percentage of hydrogen in water.
To find the percentage of hydrogen in water, divide the mass of hydrogen by the total mass of the water molecule, then multiply by 100. So, (2/18) * 100 = 100/9 ≈ 11.11%.

The problem states that a 0.125 molar solution of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is prepared in 1000 milliliters (mL) of solution. We need to find out how many grams of potassium carbonate are present in the solution.

## Step 2: Determine the molar mass of potassium carbonate
To find the mass of potassium carbonate in the solution, we first need to calculate the molar mass of potassium carbonate (K2CO3). The atomic masses are approximately: Potassium (K) = 39.1 g/mol, Carbon (C) = 12.0 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol. The molar mass of K2CO3 = (2 * 39.1) + 12.0 + (3 * 16.0) = 78.2 + 12.0 + 48.0 = 138.2 g/mol.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of potassium carbonate in the solution
Given that the solution is 0.125 molar and we have 1000 mL (or 1 liter, since 1000 mL = 1 L) of the solution, the number of moles of potassium carbonate can be found using the formula: moles = molarity * volume (in liters). So, moles = 0.125 M * 1 L = 0.125 moles.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of potassium carbonate in the solution
To find the mass of potassium carbonate in grams, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass of potassium carbonate. Mass = moles * molar mass = 0.125 moles * 138.2 g/mol.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation
Mass = 0.125 * 138.2 = 17.275 grams.

The problem states that a 200 ml solution of 0.5 molar sulfuric acid is prepared, and then 10 grams of sodium hydroxide are added to it. We need to find out how much sodium hydroxide will remain in the solution after the reaction.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid
To calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid, we use the formula: moles = molarity * volume (in liters). Given that the molarity is 0.5 and the volume is 200 ml (or 0.2 liters), we can calculate the moles of sulfuric acid as follows: moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide
The molar mass of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is approximately 40 grams per mole. Given that 10 grams of sodium hydroxide are added, we can calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide as follows: moles = mass / molar mass = 10 / 40 = 0.25 moles.

## Step 4: Determine the reaction between sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide
The reaction between sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is: H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O. From the equation, we can see that 1 mole of sulfuric acid reacts with 2 moles of sodium hydroxide.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of sodium hydroxide that reacts with sulfuric acid
Given that there are 0.1 moles of sulfuric acid, and using the stoichiometry of the reaction (1:2), we can calculate the amount of sodium hydroxide that reacts: 0.1 moles of sulfuric acid * 2 = 0.2 moles of sodium hydroxide.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of sodium hydroxide that remains in the solution

The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2, which means one carbon atom combines with two oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen.
The atomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12 grams/mole, and the atomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 grams/mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of oxygen in one mole of CO2.
Since one mole of CO2 contains two moles of oxygen, the mass of oxygen in one mole of CO2 is 2 * 16 = 32 grams.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of carbon in one mole of CO2.
The mass of carbon in one mole of CO2 is 12 grams.

## Step 6: Determine the ratio of carbon to oxygen in CO2.
The ratio of carbon to oxygen in CO2 is 12:32 or 3:8 by mass.

The problem states that we need to find the number of divisions on the circular scale of a screw gauge that coincides with the linear scale reading of 2 mm, given that the pitch of the screw gauge is 1 mm and the circular scale has 100 divisions.

## Step 2: Calculate the least count of the screw gauge.
To find the least count, we divide the pitch of the screw gauge by the number of divisions on the circular scale. The pitch is 1 mm, and the circular scale has 100 divisions. So, the least count = pitch / number of divisions = 1 mm / 100 = 0.01 mm.

## Step 3: Determine the distance moved by the screw in terms of the least count.
The linear scale reading is 2 mm, and we want to find how many divisions on the circular scale coincide with this reading. Since the least count is 0.01 mm, the number of least counts in 2 mm is 2 mm / 0.01 mm = 200.

## Step 4: Consider the circular scale reading of 0.40 mm to find the actual number of divisions coinciding with the linear scale.
Given that the circular scale reading is 0.40 mm, we need to find how many least counts are in 0.40 mm. This is 0.40 mm / 0.01 mm = 40. However, to find which division on the circular scale coincides with the linear scale reading, we should consider the difference between the linear scale reading and the circular scale reading in terms of least counts.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of divisions on the circular scale that coincides with the linear scale.
Since the pitch is 1 mm and the least count is 0.01 mm, for every 1 mm of linear scale reading, 100 divisions on the circular scale pass. For a 2 mm reading on the linear scale, it would be 2 * 100 = 200 divisions. However, we need to account for the circular scale reading of 0.40 mm. This reading indicates that 40 least counts (or divisions) have passed on the circular scale for the given linear scale position.

The object first moves 10 meters forward and then 4 meters backward. So, the total distance traveled is the sum of these two movements, which is 10 + 4 = 14 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the displacement of the object.
Displacement is the net change in position, which in this case is the difference between the initial and final positions. After moving 10 meters forward and then 4 meters backward, the object ends up 6 meters ahead of its initial position. Therefore, the displacement is 10 - 4 = 6 meters.

When a die is tossed, there are 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and when a coin is tossed, there are 2 possible outcomes (head or tail). So, the total possible outcomes for both are 6 * 2 = 12.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for getting an odd number on the die.
There are 3 odd numbers on a die (1, 3, 5). So, for each of these odd numbers, there are 2 possible outcomes from the coin toss (head or tail), making a total of 3 * 2 = 6 outcomes where the die shows an odd number.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for getting both an odd number on the die and a head on the coin.
Since there are 3 odd numbers on the die and only 1 favorable outcome from the coin (getting a head), there are 3 * 1 = 3 favorable outcomes where both conditions are met (odd number on the die and a head on the coin).

## Step 5: Calculate the probability of getting an odd number on the die and a head on the coin.

The reaction between hydrogen (H2) and chlorine (Cl2) to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) is: H2 + Cl2 -> 2HCl. From the equation, it's clear that 1 mole of hydrogen reacts with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2 moles of hydrochloric acid.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of hydrogen and chlorine
The molecular weight of hydrogen (H2) is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molecular weight of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 71 grams/mole. Given 1 gram of hydrogen, the number of moles of hydrogen is 1 / 2 = 0.5 moles. For 85 grams of chlorine, the number of moles is 85 / 71 ≈ 1.2 moles.

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant
Since the reaction requires a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen to chlorine, and there are 0.5 moles of hydrogen and approximately 1.2 moles of chlorine, hydrogen is the limiting reactant because it has the least number of moles relative to the stoichiometry of the reaction.

## Step 5: Calculate the maximum amount of chlorine that can react
Given that hydrogen is the limiting reactant and there are 0.5 moles of hydrogen, the same number of moles of chlorine can react with it (since the ratio is 1:1). Therefore, the maximum amount of chlorine that can react is 0.5 moles.

The reaction between hydrogen (H2) and chlorine (Cl2) to form hydrochloric acid (HCl) is: H2 + Cl2 -> 2HCl. From the equation, we see that 1 mole of hydrogen reacts with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2 moles of hydrochloric acid.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of hydrogen and chlorine.
The molar mass of hydrogen (H2) is approximately 2 grams/mole, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 71 grams/mole.

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant.
Given that 1 gram of hydrogen is used, we can calculate the number of moles of hydrogen: moles_of_hydrogen = mass_of_hydrogen / molar_mass_of_hydrogen = 1 / 2 = 0.5 moles. For chlorine, moles_of_chlorine = mass_of_chlorine / molar_mass_of_chlorine = 70 / 71 ≈ 0.986 moles. Since the reaction requires a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen to chlorine, and we have more moles of chlorine than hydrogen, hydrogen is the limiting reactant.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of chlorine that reacts.
Since hydrogen is the limiting reactant and we have 0.5 moles of hydrogen, 0.5 moles of chlorine will react (because of the 1:1 ratio). The mass of chlorine that reacts is: mass_of_chlorine_reacted = moles_of_chlorine_reacted * molar_mass_of_chlorine = 0.5 * 71 = 35.5 grams.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of chlorine left over.

The problem states that using a screw gauge with a pitch of 0.50 mm and a least count of 0.01 mm, the diameter of a wire is found to be 7.28 mm. We need to find the number of circular scale divisions.

## Step 2: Understand the components of the screw gauge measurement
The pitch of the screw gauge is 0.50 mm, which means that for one full rotation of the screw, the distance moved is 0.50 mm. The least count is 0.01 mm, indicating the minimum measurable distance.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of circular scale divisions
To find the number of circular scale divisions, we first need to understand that the circular scale is divided into equal parts such that one full rotation of the screw advances the screw by the pitch (0.50 mm) and covers the entire circular scale. Since the least count is 0.01 mm, the circular scale must be divided into parts that correspond to this least count.

## Step 4: Determine the relationship between pitch and least count
The ratio of the pitch to the least count gives us the number of divisions on the circular scale. This is because the pitch is the total distance covered by one full rotation, and the least count is the smallest unit of measurement. Thus, the number of divisions = pitch / least count.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of circular scale divisions
Number of divisions = pitch / least count = 0.50 mm / 0.01 mm = 50.

The problem states that there is a spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters, half of which is submerged in water and floating. We need to find the weight of the water displaced by the sphere.

## Step 2: Recall the principle of fluid displacement and the relationship between the volume of the displaced fluid and the weight of the object.
According to Archimedes' principle, the weight of the fluid displaced by an object is equal to the weight of the object itself if the object is floating. Since the sphere is half-submerged, it displaces a volume of water equal to half its own volume.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of water displaced by the sphere.
Given that the sphere has a volume of 200 cubic meters and it is half-submerged, the volume of water displaced is half the volume of the sphere, which is 200 / 2 = 100 cubic meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the weight of the water displaced using the density of water.
The density of water is approximately 1000 kilograms per cubic meter. Therefore, the weight of the water displaced can be calculated as the volume of water displaced multiplied by the density of water and then by the acceleration due to gravity (which is approximately 9.81 meters per second squared). Weight = volume * density * gravity = 100 * 1000 * 9.81.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation to find the weight of the water displaced in Newtons.
Weight = 100 * 1000 * 9.81 = 981,000 Newtons.

The problem states that an object of 1 kg mass is thrown vertically upwards. It falls back to the ground after 10 seconds. We need to find the potential energy of the object at its maximum height.

## Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas
To solve this problem, we need to use the concepts of kinematics and potential energy. The key formulas are:
- The equation of motion under gravity: s = ut + 0.5gt^2, where s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity, t is the time, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2).
- The formula for potential energy: PE = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height.

## Step 3: Calculate the initial velocity of the object
Since the object is thrown upwards and falls back to the ground after 10 seconds, the time it takes to reach the maximum height is half of the total time, which is 5 seconds. We can use the equation of motion to find the initial velocity: v = u + gt. At the maximum height, the final velocity v is 0. So, 0 = u + (-9.8)*5, since the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s^2 (downwards). Solving for u, we get u = 9.8*5 = 49 m/s.

## Step 4: Calculate the maximum height reached by the object
Using the equation of motion s = ut + 0.5gt^2, and substituting u = 49 m/s, t = 5 s, and g = -9.8 m/s^2, we get: s = 49*5 + 0.5*(-9.8)*5^2 = 245 - 122.5 = 122.5 m.

## Step 5: Calculate the potential energy at the maximum height
Now, we can calculate the potential energy using the formula PE = mgh, where m = 1 kg, g = 9.8 m/s^2, and h = 122.5 m. PE = 1*9.8*122.5 = 1202.5 J.

The problem states that a motor lifts a 2 kg object to a height of 5 meters, using a total of 107 Joules of energy. We need to find out how much energy is wasted by the motor.

## Step 2: Calculate the potential energy gained by the object
To calculate the energy wasted by the motor, we first need to determine the potential energy gained by the object. The formula for potential energy is PE = m * g * h, where m is the mass of the object (2 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height to which the object is lifted (5 meters). Therefore, PE = 2 * 9.8 * 5 = 98 Joules.

## Step 3: Calculate the energy wasted by the motor
The energy wasted by the motor can be found by subtracting the potential energy gained by the object from the total energy used by the motor. Energy wasted = Total energy used - Potential energy gained = 107 - 98 = 9 Joules.

The problem states that a spherical ball with a diameter of 4 cm fits exactly into a cylindrical box. We need to find the volume of the cylindrical box in cubic centimeters.

## Step 2: Determine the radius of the sphere
The diameter of the sphere is given as 4 cm, so the radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 4 / 2 = 2 cm.

## Step 3: Determine the dimensions of the cylindrical box
Since the sphere fits exactly into the cylindrical box, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the diameter of the cylindrical box. Therefore, the radius of the cylindrical box is also 2 cm. The height of the cylindrical box is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 4 cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the cylindrical box
The formula to calculate the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, π is a constant (approximately 3.14159), r is the radius, and h is the height. Plugging in the values, we get V = π(2)^2(4) = 3.14159 * 4 * 4 = 3.14159 * 16.

The problem states that a coin is tossed 2000 times and heads appear 1030 times. We need to find the probability of getting tails when the coin is tossed once.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of times tails appear in 2000 tosses.
Since heads appear 1030 times in 2000 tosses, the number of times tails appear can be calculated by subtracting the number of heads from the total number of tosses. So, tails appear 2000 - 1030 = 970 times.

## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting tails in one toss.
The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is getting tails, and the total number of outcomes is the total number of tosses. However, since we are looking for the probability of getting tails in one toss, we consider the frequency of tails in the given tosses as an estimation of the probability. The probability of getting tails in one toss is estimated as the number of times tails appear divided by the total number of tosses, which is 970 / 2000.

## Step 4: Simplify the fraction to find the probability.
The fraction 970 / 2000 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10. So, 970 / 2000 simplifies to 97 / 200.

## Step 5: Convert the fraction to a decimal for clarity, if necessary.
In this case, converting the fraction to a decimal is not strictly necessary since the answer can be left in fraction form or converted if required for the final presentation. The fraction 97 / 200 is a clear representation of the probability.

The problem states that the difference in the circumference of two wheels is 70 cm, and we need to find the difference in their diameters.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle
The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter (d) is twice the radius (r = d/2), we can also express the circumference as C = πd.

## Step 3: Express the difference in circumference using the formula
Let's denote the diameter of the larger wheel as D1 and the diameter of the smaller wheel as D2. The difference in their circumferences is given as 70 cm, which can be written as πD1 - πD2 = 70.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation to find the difference in diameters
Factoring out π from the equation gives us π(D1 - D2) = 70. To find the difference in diameters (D1 - D2), we need to isolate this term.

## Step 5: Solve for the difference in diameters
Divide both sides of the equation by π to solve for (D1 - D2): D1 - D2 = 70 / π.

## Step 6: Calculate the numerical value
Using the value of π ≈ 3.14159, we can calculate the difference in diameters: D1 - D2 ≈ 70 / 3.14159 ≈ 22.28 cm.

## Step 7: Round the answer appropriately if necessary
Since the problem does not specify the number of decimal places to round to, we will provide the answer with two decimal places for precision.

The problem states: ""How many grams of oxygen are required to produce 56 grams of calcium oxide?""

## Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction involved.
The production of calcium oxide (CaO) involves the reaction of calcium (Ca) with oxygen (O2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is 2Ca + O2 -> 2CaO.

## Step 3: Determine the molar mass of calcium oxide (CaO).
The molar mass of CaO is calculated as the sum of the molar masses of calcium (Ca) and oxygen (O). The molar mass of Ca is approximately 40.08 g/mol, and the molar mass of O is approximately 16.00 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of CaO is 40.08 + 16.00 = 56.08 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of calcium oxide produced.
Given that 56 grams of calcium oxide are produced, we can calculate the number of moles of CaO using the formula: moles = mass / molar mass. So, moles of CaO = 56 g / 56.08 g/mol ≈ 1 mol.

## Step 5: Use the balanced chemical equation to find the number of moles of oxygen required.
From the balanced equation 2Ca + O2 -> 2CaO, we see that 1 mole of O2 produces 2 moles of CaO. Since we have approximately 1 mole of CaO, we need half a mole of O2 to produce 1 mole of CaO, considering the stoichiometry of the reaction.

## Step 6: Calculate the mass of oxygen required.
The molar mass of O2 is approximately 32.00 g/mol (since each molecule of O2 consists of two oxygen atoms, each with a molar mass of about 16.00 g/mol). Therefore, the mass of O2 required = number of moles of O2 * molar mass of O2 = 0.5 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 16 g.

The problem states that a freely falling object covers a distance of 25 meters in 5 seconds. We need to find out how much further the object will travel in the 6th second.

## Step 2: Understand the concept of freely falling objects.
Freely falling objects are under the sole influence of gravity, which accelerates them at 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s^2) towards the Earth's surface.

## Step 3: Determine the distance covered in the first 5 seconds.
Given that the object covers 25 meters in 5 seconds, we can use the equation for distance under constant acceleration: d = vi*t + 0.5*a*t^2, where d is the distance, vi is the initial velocity (0 m/s for a freely falling object), t is the time, and a is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2).

## Step 4: Calculate the distance covered in the first 5 seconds using the equation.
Since vi = 0, the equation simplifies to d = 0.5*a*t^2. Substituting the given values: 25 = 0.5*9.8*5^2.

## Step 5: Verify the given distance for 5 seconds.
Calculating the distance using the equation: d = 0.5*9.8*5^2 = 0.5*9.8*25 = 122.5 meters. However, the problem states 25 meters, indicating a potential misunderstanding in the direct application of the formula for the given scenario. Instead, we should focus on the velocity and acceleration to find the distance traveled in the next second.

## Step 6: Calculate the velocity at the end of the 5th second.
The velocity of a freely falling object can be found using the equation v = vi + a*t. Substituting vi = 0 and t = 5 seconds, we get v = 0 + 9.8*5 = 49 m/s.

## Step 7: Calculate the distance traveled in the 6th second.
To find the distance traveled in the 6th second, we use the equation for distance under constant acceleration for 1 second, considering the velocity at the start of the 6th second. The distance traveled in the next second can also be estimated using the average velocity during that second. The velocity at"

The molar mass of CaO is calculated as the sum of the molar masses of calcium (Ca) and oxygen (O). The atomic mass of Ca is approximately 40.08 g/mol, and the atomic mass of O is approximately 16.00 g/mol. Thus, the molar mass of CaO = 40.08 + 16.00 = 56.08 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of calcium oxide produced.
Given that 56 grams of calcium oxide are produced, we calculate the number of moles of CaO using the formula: moles = mass / molar mass. So, moles of CaO = 56 / 56.08 ≈ 1 mole.

From the reaction equation 2Ca + O2 -> 2CaO, it is clear that 1 mole of O2 produces 2 moles of CaO. Since we have approximately 1 mole of CaO, we need half the amount of O2 in moles compared to CaO, due to the 1:2 ratio of O2:CaO in the reaction.

## Step 6: Calculate the moles of oxygen required.
Given that 1 mole of CaO requires 0.5 moles of O2 (since 2 moles of CaO require 1 mole of O2), for 1 mole of CaO, we need 0.5 moles of O2.

We need to find the value of the vernier constant.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the main scale and vernier scale
Given that 15 divisions of the main scale are equal to 16 divisions of the vernier scale, we can find the least count of the vernier scale. Since the main scale's smallest division is 1 mm, 15 divisions of the main scale would be 15 mm.

## Step 3: Calculate the least count of the vernier scale
The least count of the vernier scale can be calculated as the difference between one division of the main scale and one division of the vernier scale. Since 15 main scale divisions = 16 vernier scale divisions, the least count of the vernier scale is (15/16) mm.

## Step 4: Determine the vernier constant
The vernier constant is the value of one vernier division. This can be found by understanding that the difference between one main scale division and one vernier division is the vernier constant. However, in this context, the vernier constant is directly related to the least count of the vernier scale, which we've determined to be (15/16) mm. But to find the actual vernier constant in terms of the main scale division, we consider the vernier scale's division as a fraction of the main scale's division.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of the vernier constant
Since 1 main scale division = 1 mm, and 16 vernier divisions = 15 main scale divisions, 1 vernier division = (15/16) mm. This means the vernier constant, or the value of one vernier division, is (15/16) mm.

The problem states: ""If an object is dropped from the roof of a 50-meter tall building, at what speed will it hit the ground?""

## Step 2: Identify the key elements of the problem.
The key elements are the height of the building (50 meters) and the object's initial velocity (which is 0, since it's dropped).

## Step 3: Apply the formula for free fall to find the final velocity.
The formula for free fall is v^2 = v0^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, v0 is the initial velocity (0 in this case), a is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and s is the distance traveled (the height of the building, 50 meters).

## Step 4: Substitute the given values into the formula.
Substituting v0 = 0, a = 9.8 m/s^2, and s = 50 m into the formula gives v^2 = 0^2 + 2 * 9.8 * 50.

## Step 5: Calculate the final velocity.
v^2 = 0 + 2 * 9.8 * 50 = 980, so v = sqrt(980).

## Step 6: Calculate the square root of 980.
v = sqrt(980) = sqrt(4*245) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(245) = 2*sqrt(245) ≈ 2*15.62 = 31.24 m/s.

The problem states that a Vernier scale is used with a meter scale where 10 divisions on the Vernier scale are equal to 9 millimeters. We need to find the smallest length that can be measured using this combination.

## Step 2: Understand the principle of the Vernier scale.
The Vernier scale is a device that allows for more precise measurements than a standard scale by using a secondary scale that slides along the main scale. The difference in the lengths of the divisions between the two scales allows for the measurement of smaller units.

## Step 3: Calculate the least count of the Vernier scale.
To find the least count (the smallest unit of measurement) of the Vernier scale, we first determine the difference in length between one division on the meter scale and one division on the Vernier scale. Given that 10 Vernier scale divisions equal 9 millimeters, we calculate the least count as follows:
Least count = (1 division on the meter scale) - (1 division on the Vernier scale).
Since 1 meter = 1000 millimeters, and assuming the meter scale has divisions of 1 millimeter (for simplicity, as the specific division size of the meter scale is not provided), we can proceed with the calculation.

## Step 4: Calculate the value of one Vernier scale division.
First, calculate the value of one division on the Vernier scale:
1 division on the Vernier scale = 9 mm / 10 = 0.9 mm.

## Step 5: Determine the least count.
Given that 1 division on the meter scale equals 1 mm, the least count (the smallest difference that can be measured) is:
Least count = 1 mm - 0.9 mm = 0.1 mm.

## Step 6: Conclusion.
The least count represents the smallest length that can be measured using the combination of the meter scale and the Vernier scale. Therefore, the smallest length that can be measured is 0.1 mm.

The problem states that there are 13 (octal) students in Bipasha's class. Each student has 56 (hexadecimal) pens. We need to find the total number of pens all the students have, converted to the decimal number system.

## Step 2: Convert the number of students from octal to decimal.
To convert 13 from octal to decimal, we use the formula: decimal = (1 * 8^1) + (3 * 8^0) = (1 * 8) + (3 * 1) = 8 + 3 = 11.

## Step 3: Convert the number of pens each student has from hexadecimal to decimal.
To convert 56 from hexadecimal to decimal, we use the formula: decimal = (5 * 16^1) + (6 * 16^0) = (5 * 16) + (6 * 1) = 80 + 6 = 86.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of pens all the students have in decimal.
Now that we know there are 11 students (in decimal) and each has 86 pens (in decimal), we can find the total number of pens by multiplying the number of students by the number of pens each student has: total_pens = 11 * 86 = 946.

The problem states that a 1 kg mass gun fires a 5 gram mass bullet, and as a result, the gun recoils with a velocity of 2 m/s. We need to find the final velocity of the bullet.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant physical principle.
The principle of conservation of momentum applies here. The total momentum before the bullet is fired is zero (since both the gun and the bullet are initially at rest), and it remains zero after the bullet is fired. Momentum is calculated as the product of mass and velocity.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the conservation of momentum.
Let's denote the velocity of the bullet as \(v_b\) and the velocity of the gun as \(v_g = -2\) m/s (negative because it's in the opposite direction to the bullet). The mass of the gun is 1 kg = 1000 grams, and the mass of the bullet is 5 grams. The equation based on the conservation of momentum is \(0 = m_bv_b + m_gv_g\), where \(m_b\) is the mass of the bullet and \(m_g\) is the mass of the gun.

## Step 4: Plug in the values and solve for \(v_b\).
Given \(m_b = 5\) grams = 0.005 kg, \(m_g = 1000\) grams = 1 kg, and \(v_g = -2\) m/s, we substitute these into the equation:
\(0 = 0.005v_b + 1 \times (-2)\).
Solving for \(v_b\), we get:
\(0.005v_b = 2\),
\(v_b = \frac{2}{0.005}\).

## Step 5: Calculate the final velocity of the bullet.
\(v_b = \frac{2}{0.005} = 400\) m/s.

The problem states that a mountain at a distance of 500 kilometers produces an angle of 5 degrees. We need to find the height of the mountain in meters.

## Step 2: Identify the given information and what needs to be found.
Given: distance to the mountain = 500 kilometers, angle of elevation = 5 degrees. To find: height of the mountain in meters.

## Step 3: Convert the given distance from kilometers to meters because the height of the mountain is required in meters.
1 kilometer = 1000 meters, so 500 kilometers = 500 * 1000 = 500,000 meters.

## Step 4: Use trigonometric principles to find the height of the mountain.
The tangent of the angle of elevation (5 degrees) is equal to the height of the mountain divided by the distance to the mountain. So, tan(5 degrees) = height / 500,000.

The problem states that 10 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reacts with 5 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) to form sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and water (H2O). We need to find out how many grams of sodium hydroxide will be left over after the reaction is complete.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.
The balanced chemical equation is: 2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O.

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol, and the molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.
Number of moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol.
Number of moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2 = 5 g / 44 g/mol = 0.114 mol.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant in the reaction.
From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the number of moles of CO2 required to react with 0.25 mol of NaOH is 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 mol. Since there are only 0.114 mol of CO2 available, CO2 is the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide that will react with the available carbon dioxide.
Since CO2 is the limiting reactant, it will determine the amount of NaOH that reacts. The number of moles of NaOH that will react is twice the number of moles of CO2, which is 2 * 0.114 = 0.228 mol. However, since we have less than this amount of NaOH (0.25 mol), all of the CO2 will react, and the amount of NaOH that reacts is actually determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction with CO2. The amount of NaOH that reacts is 2 * 0"

The problem is asking for the length of an arc of a circle with a radius of 5 cm, where the arc subtends an angle of 60 degrees at the center of the circle.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the length of an arc of a circle.
The formula for the length of an arc of a circle is given by: arc length = (θ/360) * 2 * π * r, where θ is the angle subtended by the arc at the center of the circle in degrees, π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula.
Given that the radius (r) is 5 cm and the angle (θ) is 60 degrees, we can substitute these values into the formula: arc length = (60/360) * 2 * π * 5.

## Step 4: Perform the calculations.
First, simplify the fraction: 60/360 = 1/6. Then, calculate the rest of the formula: arc length = (1/6) * 2 * π * 5 = (1/6) * 10 * π ≈ (1/6) * 10 * 3.14159.

The problem states that the length of the diagonal of a square is √2 cm and asks for the area of the square in square centimeters.

## Step 2: Recall the relationship between the diagonal and the side length of a square.
In a square, the diagonal (d) and the side length (s) are related by the Pythagorean theorem: d^2 = s^2 + s^2, which simplifies to d^2 = 2s^2.

## Step 3: Solve for the side length using the given diagonal length.
Given d = √2 cm, we substitute this into the equation d^2 = 2s^2 to find s. So, (√2)^2 = 2s^2, which simplifies to 2 = 2s^2.

## Step 4: Solve for s^2.
Dividing both sides of the equation 2 = 2s^2 by 2 gives s^2 = 1.

## Step 5: Find the side length s.
Taking the square root of both sides of s^2 = 1 gives s = 1 cm.

The problem states that a wheel travels a distance of 4 kilometers by rotating 70 times. We need to find the diameter of the wheel in meters.

## Step 2: Convert the distance from kilometers to meters.
Since 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters, the distance traveled by the wheel is 4 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = 4000 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the wheel using the formula for the distance traveled.
The distance traveled by the wheel is equal to the number of rotations multiplied by the circumference of the wheel. We can use the formula: distance = number of rotations * circumference. Given that the distance is 4000 meters and the number of rotations is 70, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the circumference: circumference = distance / number of rotations = 4000 meters / 70.

## Step 4: Perform the division to find the circumference.
circumference = 4000 meters / 70 = 57.142857 meters (approximately).

## Step 5: Use the formula for the circumference of a circle to find the diameter.
The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the diameter: d = C / π. Substituting the value of the circumference from step 4 and using the approximation π ≈ 3.14159, we can calculate the diameter.

The problem states that while measuring the length of a rod using a vernier caliper with a least count of 0.5 mm on the main scale, the main scale reading is 5 mm and the vernier scale reading is 16 divisions. It is also given that 19 divisions on the main scale are equal to 20 divisions on the vernier scale. We need to find the vernier constant.

## Step 2: Understand the concept of vernier constant.
The vernier constant is the difference between the value of one main scale division and the value of one vernier scale division. It is calculated as the least count of the vernier caliper.

## Step 3: Calculate the least count of the main scale.
Given that the least count of the main scale is 0.5 mm, this means each division on the main scale represents 0.5 mm.

## Step 4: Determine the relationship between main scale and vernier scale divisions.
We are given that 19 divisions on the main scale are equal to 20 divisions on the vernier scale. This implies that 19 main scale divisions = 20 vernier scale divisions.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of one vernier scale division in terms of main scale divisions.
Since 19 main scale divisions equal 20 vernier scale divisions, and knowing 1 main scale division equals 0.5 mm, we can calculate the value of one vernier scale division. The total length represented by 19 main scale divisions is 19 * 0.5 mm = 9.5 mm. Since this is equal to 20 vernier scale divisions, one vernier scale division represents 9.5 mm / 20 = 0.475 mm.

## Step 6: Calculate the vernier constant.
The vernier constant is the difference between one main scale division (0.5 mm) and one vernier scale division (0.475 mm). Therefore, the vernier constant = 0.5 mm - 0.475 mm = 0.025 mm.

The problem states that a cow is tied with a rope in such a way that it can graze on a circular field of 25 square meters. We need to find the diameter of the field.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the area of a circle and its diameter.
The area of a circle (A) is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter (d) is twice the radius, we can also express the area in terms of diameter as A = π(d/2)^2.

## Step 3: Use the given area to find the diameter of the circular field.
Given that the area of the circular field is 25 square meters, we can set up the equation 25 = π(d/2)^2. To find the diameter, we need to solve this equation for d.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for the diameter.
First, multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction: 4 * 25 = πd^2, which simplifies to 100 = πd^2. Then, divide both sides by π to isolate d^2: d^2 = 100 / π.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of d^2 and then find d.
Using the approximation π ≈ 3.14159, we can calculate d^2 = 100 / 3.14159 ≈ 31.83. Taking the square root of both sides gives us d ≈ √31.83.

## Step 6: Calculate the square root to find the diameter.
Calculating the square root of 31.83 gives us d ≈ 5.64 meters.

The problem asks for the molecular weight of 2 moles of copper sulfate.

## Step 2: Identify the chemical formula for copper sulfate.
The chemical formula for copper sulfate is CuSO4.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic weights of the elements in copper sulfate.
The atomic weight of copper (Cu) is approximately 63.55 g/mol, the atomic weight of sulfur (S) is approximately 32.07 g/mol, and the atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of copper sulfate.
To find the molecular weight of CuSO4, we multiply the atomic weight of each element by the number of atoms of that element in the molecule and then sum these values. The formula CuSO4 indicates there is 1 copper atom, 1 sulfur atom, and 4 oxygen atoms. So, the molecular weight of CuSO4 is calculated as follows:
Molecular weight = (1 * atomic weight of Cu) + (1 * atomic weight of S) + (4 * atomic weight of O)
Molecular weight = (1 * 63.55) + (1 * 32.07) + (4 * 16.00)
Molecular weight = 63.55 + 32.07 + 64.00
Molecular weight = 159.62 g/mol

## Step 5: Calculate the total weight for 2 moles of copper sulfate.
Since the molecular weight of copper sulfate is 159.62 g/mol, the total weight for 2 moles is:
Total weight = 2 * molecular weight of CuSO4
Total weight = 2 * 159.62
Total weight = 319.24 g

The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (selecting a perfect square) by the total number of possible outcomes (the total number of natural numbers from 1 to 100). So, the probability = number of perfect squares / total numbers = 10 / 100.

## Step 5: Simplify the fraction to express the probability in its simplest form.
The fraction 10 / 100 can be simplified to 1 / 10.

The problem states that out of a certain number of students, 60 students prefer cricket, 40 students prefer football, and 25 students prefer both sports. We need to find the minimum number of students who prefer at least one of these sports.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of students who prefer each sport, including those who prefer both.
To find the total number of students who prefer at least one sport, we need to add the number of students who prefer cricket and the number of students who prefer football, and then subtract the number of students who prefer both sports to avoid double-counting.

## Step 3: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the minimum number of students who prefer at least one sport.
Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we calculate the total number of students who prefer at least one sport as follows: Total = (number of students who prefer cricket) + (number of students who prefer football) - (number of students who prefer both sports). Total = 60 + 40 - 25.

## Step 4: Perform the arithmetic calculation.
Total = 60 + 40 - 25 = 100 - 25 = 75.

The problem states that a boy with a mass of 40 kg climbs a staircase to the roof in 15 seconds. The staircase has 20 steps, and each step is 16 cm high. We need to find the power of the boy in watts.

## Step 2: Convert the height of each step from centimeters to meters
To calculate the power, we first need to find the total height climbed by the boy. Since each step is 16 cm high, we convert this to meters: 16 cm = 0.16 m.

## Step 3: Calculate the total height climbed by the boy
The total height climbed is the number of steps multiplied by the height of each step: 20 steps * 0.16 m/step = 3.2 m.

## Step 4: Calculate the potential energy gained by the boy
The potential energy (PE) gained by the boy is given by the formula PE = m * g * h, where m is the mass of the boy (40 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height climbed (3.2 m). So, PE = 40 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 3.2 m = 1254.4 J.

## Step 5: Calculate the power of the boy
Power (P) is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of energy transfer. It can be calculated using the formula P = Energy / Time. The energy transferred in this case is the potential energy gained by the boy (1254.4 J), and the time taken is 15 seconds. So, P = 1254.4 J / 15 s = 83.63 W.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 36 cm. We need to find the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Determine the volume of the original sphere.
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. Substituting \(r = 3\) cm into the formula gives us \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi \times 27 = 36\pi\) cubic cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cylinder.
The volume of the cylinder will be the same as the volume of the sphere since the sphere is melted to form the cylinder. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is also \(36\pi\) cubic cm.

## Step 4: Find the radius of the cylinder.
The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. We know \(V = 36\pi\) and \(h = 36\) cm. Substituting these values into the formula gives us \(36\pi = \pi r^2 \times 36\). Simplifying, we get \(r^2 = \frac{36\pi}{36\pi} = 1\), which means \(r = 1\) cm.

## Step 5: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder.
The curved surface area \(A\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \(A = 2\pi r h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. Substituting \(r = 1\) cm and \(h = 36\) cm into the formula gives us \(A = 2\pi \times 1 \times 36 = 72\pi\) square cm.

## Step 6: Compute the numerical value of the curved surface area.
Since \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the numerical value of \(72\pi\). However, for exactness, we keep the answer in terms of \(\pi\)"

The problem states, ""What is the probability of a draw in a test cricket match?""

## Step 2: Understand the context and possible outcomes of a test cricket match.
In a test cricket match, there are three possible outcomes: a win for one of the teams or a draw. Unlike other forms of cricket, test matches can end in a draw if the allotted time expires before a team can win.

## Step 3: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.
For simplicity, let's consider that each match can have one of three outcomes: Team A wins, Team B wins, or it's a draw.

## Step 4: Recognize the challenge in calculating the probability of a draw.
Calculating the exact probability of a draw in a test cricket match is complex because it depends on various factors such as the teams' skills, the pitch conditions, weather, and how the match unfolds. However, we can consider historical data to estimate probabilities.

## Step 5: Estimate the probability based on historical data or logical reasoning.
Historically, the percentage of draws in test cricket has varied over time and depends on the teams playing and the conditions. Without specific historical data or a time frame to consider, we can acknowledge that draws are less common than wins but still occur frequently enough to be a significant outcome.

## Step 6: Conclude the thought process with a logical deduction.
Given the variability and the lack of specific data in the question, we must deduce that the probability of a draw cannot be precisely calculated without more information. However, in the spirit of providing a response, we can estimate that draws occur in a notable percentage of matches, but this percentage can fluctuate.

The problem states: ""In a right-angled triangle, the base and hypotenuse are 3 and 5 respectively. What is the height?""

## Step 2: Recall the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the triangle.
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side (c) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides (a and b), which can be expressed as \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\). Here, we can denote the base as 'a' (which is 3), the hypotenuse as 'c' (which is 5), and the height (which we are trying to find) as 'b'.

## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem with the given values.
Given that \(c = 5\) and \(a = 3\), we can substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem to solve for 'b': \(5^2 = 3^2 + b^2\).

## Step 4: Perform the calculations to solve for 'b'.
Calculating the squares: \(25 = 9 + b^2\).

## Step 5: Solve for \(b^2\).
Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to isolate \(b^2\): \(b^2 = 25 - 9\).

## Step 6: Calculate \(b^2\).
\(b^2 = 16\).

## Step 7: Find 'b' by taking the square root of both sides.
Since \(b^2 = 16\), taking the square root gives \(b = 4\). Note that in the context of lengths, we consider the positive square root.

The problem states that a spherical ball with a diameter of 2 cm fits exactly into a cylindrical box. We need to find the volume of the unused part of the cylinder.

## Step 2: Calculate the radius of the sphere and the cylinder.
Since the diameter of the sphere is 2 cm, the radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 1 cm. The cylinder's radius will also be 1 cm because the sphere fits exactly inside it.

## Step 3: Calculate the height of the cylinder.
The height of the cylinder will be equal to the diameter of the sphere because the sphere touches both the top and bottom bases of the cylinder. Therefore, the height of the cylinder is 2 cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the cylinder.
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Substituting the values, we get V = π(1)²(2) = 2π cubic cm.

## Step 5: Calculate the volume of the sphere.
The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius. Substituting the value, we get V = (4/3)π(1)³ = (4/3)π cubic cm.

## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the unused part of the cylinder.
The volume of the unused part of the cylinder is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the sphere. So, the unused volume is 2π - (4/3)π.

## Step 7: Simplify the expression for the unused volume.
To simplify, we factor out π: π(2 - 4/3). Finding a common denominator, we get π(6/3 - 4/3) = π(2/3).

## Step 8: Calculate the numerical value of the unused volume.
Since π is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the numerical value: π(2/3) ≈ 3.14159 * (2/3) ≈ 2.0944. However, for exactness, we keep it as (2/3)π cubic cm.

## Step 2: Identify the key elements of the problem.
The object is thrown vertically upwards, and we need to find the initial velocity required for it to hit the ground after 10 seconds. We will use the equation of motion under gravity, which is s = ut + 0.5gt^2, where s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity, t is the time, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2).

## Step 3: Determine the displacement of the object.
Since the object is thrown upwards and eventually hits the ground, its initial and final positions are at the same height. Thus, the displacement (s) is 0 (since it ends up back where it started).

## Step 4: Apply the equation of motion.
Substitute the known values into the equation: 0 = u * 10 + 0.5 * -9.8 * 10^2. Note that g is negative because the object is thrown upwards against gravity.

## Step 5: Solve for the initial velocity (u).
Rearrange the equation to solve for u: u * 10 = 0.5 * 9.8 * 100. Simplify to find u: u = (0.5 * 9.8 * 100) / 10.

The problem states that 2 grams of magnesium and 2 grams of oxygen gas are mixed in a suitable environment to produce 4 grams of magnesium oxide, but the desired amount of product was not obtained. We need to find out how many grams of oxygen reacted.

## Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction involved.
The chemical reaction for the formation of magnesium oxide from magnesium and oxygen is: 2Mg + O2 -> 2MgO. From the equation, we see that 2 moles of magnesium react with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 2 moles of magnesium oxide.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of magnesium and magnesium oxide.
The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.3 g/mol, and the molar mass of magnesium oxide (MgO) is approximately 40.3 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of magnesium used.
Given that 2 grams of magnesium are used, we can calculate the number of moles of magnesium: moles = mass / molar mass = 2 / 24.3 ≈ 0.0823 mol.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant.
Since we are trying to produce 4 grams of magnesium oxide and the reaction requires a 1:1 molar ratio of Mg to MgO, we first calculate the moles of MgO that would be produced from the given magnesium: moles of MgO = moles of Mg = 0.0823 mol (since 2Mg -> 2MgO). The molar mass of MgO is 40.3 g/mol, so the mass of MgO that can be formed from 2 grams of Mg is: mass = moles * molar mass = 0.0823 * 40.3 ≈ 3.32 g. This is less than the desired 4 grams of MgO, indicating magnesium is the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of oxygen required to react with the given magnesium.
From the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O2. Given that we have approximately 0.0823 mol of Mg, we need half of this amount in moles of O2 to react completely with Mg: moles of O2 = moles of Mg / 2 = 0."

The problem states: ""In a right-angled triangle, the height (perpendicular) and hypotenuse are 5 and 13 respectively. What is the base?""

## Step 2: Recall the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), which can be expressed as \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\). Here, we know the hypotenuse (c = 13) and the height (let's say a = 5), and we need to find the base (b).

## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the base.
Given that \(c = 13\) and \(a = 5\), we can substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem equation: \(13^2 = 5^2 + b^2\).

## Step 4: Solve for \(b^2\).
Solving the equation for \(b^2\), we have: \(169 = 25 + b^2\). Subtract 25 from both sides to get \(b^2 = 169 - 25 = 144\).

## Step 5: Find \(b\) by taking the square root of \(b^2\).
Taking the square root of both sides gives us \(b = \sqrt{144} = 12\).

The problem states: ""17.75 grams of sodium sulfate is dissolved in a 250 milliliter solution. What is the density of the solution?""

## Step 2: Determine the mass of the solution
To find the density of the solution, we first need to calculate the total mass of the solution. The mass of sodium sulfate is given as 17.75 grams. We also need to calculate the mass of the solvent (water), which can be approximated as equal to the volume of the solution in grams, since the density of water is approximately 1 gram per milliliter. Therefore, the mass of the solvent is 250 milliliters * 1 gram/milliliter = 250 grams.

## Step 3: Calculate the total mass of the solution
The total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of sodium sulfate and the mass of the solvent. total_mass = mass_of_sodium_sulfate + mass_of_solvent = 17.75 grams + 250 grams = 267.75 grams.

## Step 4: Calculate the density of the solution
Density is defined as mass per unit volume. We have the total mass of the solution and the total volume of the solution (250 milliliters or 0.250 liters). The formula for density is density = mass / volume. We need to ensure that the units are consistent, so we'll use grams and milliliters for mass and volume respectively, and then convert the result to the appropriate units if necessary.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation for density
density = total_mass / volume = 267.75 grams / 250 milliliters = 1.071 grams per milliliter.

The problem states: ""For an object moving with uniform acceleration, its velocity increases from 4 m/s to 8 m/s in 2 seconds. What will be the velocity of the object after 4 seconds?""

## Step 2: Determine the acceleration of the object
To find the acceleration, we use the formula: acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time. Given that the initial velocity is 4 m/s, the final velocity is 8 m/s, and the time is 2 seconds, we can calculate the acceleration as follows: acceleration = (8 m/s - 4 m/s) / 2 s = 4 m/s / 2 s = 2 m/s^2.

## Step 3: Calculate the velocity after 4 seconds
Now that we know the acceleration, we can use the formula: final velocity = initial velocity + acceleration * time. Since we want to find the velocity after 4 seconds and we know the initial velocity (4 m/s) and the acceleration (2 m/s^2), we can plug these values into the formula. However, we must note that the initial velocity for this calculation should be the velocity at the start of the 4-second period, which is given as 4 m/s. Thus, the final velocity after 4 seconds = 4 m/s + 2 m/s^2 * 4 s = 4 m/s + 8 m/s = 12 m/s.

The problem states that a container has a base area of 0.30 square meters and a height of 0.20 meters. It requires 75.6 kilograms of glycerin to fill the container. We need to find the density of the glycerin in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc).

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the container in cubic meters.
To find the volume of the container, we multiply its base area by its height. Volume = base area * height = 0.30 m^2 * 0.20 m = 0.06 cubic meters.

## Step 3: Convert the volume of the container from cubic meters to cubic centimeters (or milliliters).
Since 1 cubic meter = 1,000,000 cubic centimeters (or 1,000 liters), the volume in cubic centimeters = 0.06 * 1,000,000 = 60,000 cubic centimeters.

## Step 4: Convert the weight of glycerin from kilograms to grams.
Since 1 kilogram = 1,000 grams, the weight of glycerin in grams = 75.6 kg * 1,000 g/kg = 75,600 grams.

## Step 5: Calculate the density of the glycerin in grams per cubic centimeter.
The density of glycerin can be found by dividing the weight of glycerin by the volume of the container. Density = weight / volume = 75,600 g / 60,000 cc.

## Step 2: Identify the initial and final heights of the object
The initial height (h1) is 60 meters, and the final height (h2) is 10 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the initial and final potential energies of the object
The potential energy (PE) is given by the formula PE = m * g * h, where m is the mass of the object (2 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height.
Initial potential energy (PE1) = 2 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 60 m = 1176 J
Final potential energy (PE2) = 2 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 10 m = 196 J

## Step 4: Calculate the initial and final kinetic energies of the object
Since the object starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy (KE1) is 0 J.
To find the final kinetic energy (KE2), we need to use the law of conservation of energy, which states that the total energy (kinetic energy + potential energy) remains constant.
Initial total energy = Initial potential energy + Initial kinetic energy = 1176 J + 0 J = 1176 J
Final total energy = Final potential energy + Final kinetic energy = 196 J + KE2

## Step 5: Apply the law of conservation of energy
Since the total energy remains constant, we can set up the equation:
1176 J = 196 J + KE2
Subtracting 196 J from both sides gives:
KE2 = 980 J

## Step 6: Calculate the ratio of final kinetic energy to final potential energy
The ratio is given by KE2 / PE2 = 980 J / 196 J = 5

## Step 2: Understand the concept of Cartesian product.
The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted by A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. In this case, since we are dealing with A x A, we are looking at all possible ordered pairs (a, a') where both a and a' are elements of set A.

Since the problem does not mention any yellow balls in the bag, we assume there are no yellow balls. Therefore, the number of yellow balls is 0.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball.
The probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing a yellow ball, which is 0 since there are no yellow balls. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 45.

The problem states that the difference in the circumference of two wheels is 120 cm, and we need to find the difference in their diameters.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle.
The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by C = 2πr or C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, r is the radius, and d is the diameter of the circle.

## Step 3: Establish the relationship between the circumferences and diameters of the two wheels.
Let's denote the diameter of the larger wheel as D1 and the smaller wheel as D2. The difference in their circumferences is given as 120 cm. Using the formula C = πd, we can write the equation as πD1 - πD2 = 120.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation to find the difference in diameters.
Since π is a common factor on both sides of the equation, we can factor it out: π(D1 - D2) = 120. To find the difference in diameters (D1 - D2), we divide both sides of the equation by π.

## Step 5: Calculate the difference in diameters.
D1 - D2 = 120 / π. Using the approximate value of π as 3.14159, we can calculate the difference: D1 - D2 ≈ 120 / 3.14159.

## Step 2: Convert the given hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation.
First, we convert 452 from hexadecimal to decimal: $452_{16} = 4 \times 16^2 + 5 \times 16^1 + 2 \times 16^0 = 4 \times 256 + 5 \times 16 + 2 \times 1 = 1024 + 80 + 2 = 1106$.
Then, we convert 9 from hexadecimal to decimal: $9_{16} = 9 \times 16^0 = 9$.

## Step 3: Subtract the number of bananas given to Karim from the total number of bananas Russell had.
To find out how many bananas Russell has left, we subtract the number of bananas given to Karim (9 in decimal) from the total number of bananas Russell had (1106 in decimal): $1106 - 9 = 1097$.

## Step 4: Convert the result back to hexadecimal.
Now, we need to convert 1097 from decimal back to hexadecimal.
Divide 1097 by 16: $1097 \div 16 = 68$ remainder $9$.
So, the last digit (in hexadecimal) is $9$.
Then, divide 68 by 16: $68 \div 16 = 4$ remainder $4$.
So, the next digit (in hexadecimal) is $4$.
Since $4$ is less than $16$, it is the last division we need, and $4$ is the most significant digit in our hexadecimal number.
Therefore, $1097$ in decimal is $449$ in hexadecimal.

The problem asks how many grams of sodium carbonate need to be added to 2 liters of solution to make it semimolar.

## Step 2: Understand the concept of semimolar solution.
A semimolar solution is a solution that contains half the number of moles of solute per liter as a molar solution. Since a molar solution contains 1 mole of solute per liter, a semimolar solution contains 0.5 moles of solute per liter.

## Step 3: Calculate the total moles of sodium carbonate required for 2 liters of semimolar solution.
For 2 liters of solution, the total moles of sodium carbonate required can be calculated by multiplying the volume of the solution in liters by the molarity of the semimolar solution. So, 2 liters * 0.5 moles/liter = 1 mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the molar mass of sodium carbonate.
The chemical formula for sodium carbonate is Na2CO3. The molar mass can be calculated as follows: (2 * atomic mass of Na) + (1 * atomic mass of C) + (3 * atomic mass of O). The atomic masses are approximately: Na = 23 g/mol, C = 12 g/mol, O = 16 g/mol. So, the molar mass of Na2CO3 = (2 * 23) + 12 + (3 * 16) = 46 + 12 + 48 = 106 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of sodium carbonate required.
To find the mass of sodium carbonate needed, we multiply the number of moles required by the molar mass of sodium carbonate. So, 1 mole * 106 g/mol = 106 grams.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm. We need to find the height of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Recall the volume formulas for a sphere and a cylinder.
The volume of a sphere is given by \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. The volume of a cylinder is given by \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the original sphere.
Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, we substitute \(r = 6\) cm into \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\) to find the volume of the sphere. This gives us \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (216) = 288\pi\).

## Step 4: Set up the equation for the volume of the cylinder.
The volume of the cylinder, which is equal to the volume of the sphere, can be represented as \(288\pi = \pi (3)^2 h\), since the radius of the cylinder is 3 cm.

## Step 2: Determine the possible outcomes when rolling a die and tossing a coin.
When rolling a die, there are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. When tossing a coin, there are 2 possible outcomes: heads or tails.

## Step 3: Identify the favorable outcomes for the die, which are numbers divisible by 3.
The numbers on a die that are divisible by 3 are 3 and 6. So, there are 2 favorable outcomes for the die.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting a number divisible by 3 on the die.
The probability of getting a number divisible by 3 on the die is the number of favorable outcomes (2) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6), which is 2/6 = 1/3.

The problem states that in a hydraulic press, the area of the smaller piston is 10 square centimeters and the area of the larger piston is 350 square centimeters. When a force of 100 Newtons is applied to the smaller piston, we need to find out how much force will be exerted on the larger piston.

## Step 2: Understand the principle of hydraulic presses.
Hydraulic presses operate on the principle of Pascal's law, which states that the pressure applied to a fluid in a closed system is transmitted equally in all directions. Since pressure is force per unit area, the force exerted on the larger piston can be calculated using the ratio of the areas of the two pistons.

## Step 3: Calculate the pressure applied to the smaller piston.
The pressure (P) applied to the smaller piston can be calculated using the formula P = F / A, where F is the force applied (100 Newtons) and A is the area of the smaller piston (10 square centimeters). So, P = 100 / 10 = 10 Newtons per square centimeter.

## Step 4: Calculate the force exerted on the larger piston.
Since the pressure is transmitted equally, the same pressure (10 Newtons per square centimeter) is applied to the larger piston. The force (F) exerted on the larger piston can be calculated using the formula F = P * A, where P is the pressure (10 Newtons per square centimeter) and A is the area of the larger piston (350 square centimeters). So, F = 10 * 350 = 3500 Newtons.

## Step 2: Recall the formula to calculate pressure due to a fluid column.
The pressure (P) at the bottom of a vessel filled with a fluid can be calculated using the formula P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of the fluid (in this case, water), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height of the fluid column.

## Step 3: Identify the density of water.
The density of water (ρ) is approximately 1000 kg/m^3.

The problem states that there is a solution with 0.5 liters of volume containing 56 grams of caustic potash (potassium hydroxide, KOH) dissolved in it. We need to find out how much caustic potash will remain after adding 18.25 grams of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the solution.

## Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction
The reaction between caustic potash (KOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a neutralization reaction. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:
KOH + HCl -> KCl + H2O
From the equation, it's clear that 1 mole of KOH reacts with 1 mole of HCl to produce 1 mole of potassium chloride (KCl) and 1 mole of water (H2O).

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of KOH initially present
First, calculate the molar mass of KOH: The atomic mass of potassium (K) is approximately 39 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So, the molar mass of KOH = 39 + 16 + 1 = 56 g/mol.
The number of moles of KOH initially present = mass of KOH / molar mass of KOH = 56 g / 56 g/mol = 1 mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of HCl added
The molar mass of HCl is approximately 36.5 g/mol (hydrogen is 1 g/mol and chlorine is 35.5 g/mol).
The number of moles of HCl added = mass of HCl / molar mass of HCl = 18.25 g / 36.5 g/mol = 0.5 moles.

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant
Since the reaction is 1:1, 1 mole of KOH will react with 1 mole of HCl. We have 1 mole of KOH and 0.5 moles of HCl. Therefore, HCl is the limiting reactant, and it will completely react with 0.5 moles of KOH, leaving the rest of the KOH unreacted.

The problem states that 10 grams of sodium hydroxide reacts with 5 grams of carbon dioxide, and we are asked to find the amount of salt (sodium carbonate) produced in the reaction.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.
The reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO2) produces sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and water (H2O). The balanced chemical equation is:
2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O

## Step 3: Determine the molar masses of the reactants and products.
The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol, the molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 g/mol, and the molar mass of Na2CO3 is approximately 106 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of NaOH and CO2.
Number of moles of NaOH = mass of NaOH / molar mass of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol
Number of moles of CO2 = mass of CO2 / molar mass of CO2 = 5 g / 44 g/mol = 0.114 mol

## Step 5: Determine the limiting reactant.
From the balanced equation, we see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2. Since we have 0.25 mol of NaOH and 0.114 mol of CO2, and considering the stoichiometry (2:1), NaOH is in excess because 0.114 mol of CO2 would require only 0.228 mol of NaOH (which is less than the 0.25 mol available), making CO2 the limiting reactant.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount of Na2CO3 produced based on the limiting reactant.
Since 1 mole of CO2 produces 1 mole of Na2CO3, and we have 0.114 mol of CO2, the number of moles of Na2CO3 produced is also 0.114 mol.

## Step 7: Calculate the mass of Na2CO3 produced.

The problem states that a 0.125 molar solution of potassium carbonate is prepared in 750 milliliters. We need to find out how many moles of potassium carbonate are in the solution.

## Step 2: Understand the given information.
The molarity of the solution is given as 0.125 M, and the volume of the solution is 750 milliliters. First, we need to convert the volume from milliliters to liters because molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution.

## Step 3: Convert the volume from milliliters to liters.
To convert milliliters to liters, we divide by 1000 since 1 liter = 1000 milliliters. So, 750 milliliters = 750 / 1000 = 0.75 liters.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of potassium carbonate.
The formula to find the number of moles from molarity is: moles = molarity * volume (in liters). Plugging in the given values, we get moles = 0.125 M * 0.75 L.

## Step 2: Identify the chemical formula for Calcium Phosphate.
Calcium Phosphate is chemically represented as Ca₃(PO₄)₂, which means it consists of 3 calcium atoms, 2 phosphorus atoms, and 8 oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the atomic weights of the elements in Calcium Phosphate.
- The atomic weight of Calcium (Ca) is approximately 40.08 g/mol.
- The atomic weight of Phosphorus (P) is approximately 30.97 g/mol.
- The atomic weight of Oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of one mole of Calcium Phosphate (Ca₃(PO₄)₂).
The molecular weight is calculated as follows:
- For Calcium: 3 * 40.08 = 120.24 g/mol
- For Phosphorus: 2 * 30.97 = 61.94 g/mol
- For Oxygen: 8 * 16.00 = 128.00 g/mol

The problem states that at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, the length of a steel beam is 20 meters. We need to find out how much the length of the beam will increase when the temperature rises to 100 degrees Celsius, given that the coefficient of linear expansion for steel is 11.6 x 10^-6 per Kelvin.

## Step 2: Calculate the change in temperature in Kelvin.
The initial temperature is 60 degrees Celsius, and the final temperature is 100 degrees Celsius. To find the change in temperature, we subtract the initial temperature from the final temperature. However, since the coefficient of expansion is given per Kelvin, and 1 degree Celsius equals 1 Kelvin, the change in temperature is 100 - 60 = 40 degrees Celsius, which is also 40 Kelvin.

## Step 3: Use the formula for linear expansion to calculate the increase in length.
The formula for linear expansion is ΔL = α * L * ΔT, where ΔL is the change in length, α is the coefficient of linear expansion, L is the original length, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Plugging in the given values, we get ΔL = (11.6 x 10^-6) * 20 * 40.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation.

The problem states that a wheel travels a distance of 3.25 kilometers by rotating 25 times, and we need to find the diameter of the wheel in meters.

## Step 2: Convert the distance from kilometers to meters
First, we convert the distance from kilometers to meters. Since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters, the distance traveled is 3.25 km * 1000 m/km = 3250 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the wheel
The wheel rotates 25 times to cover a distance of 3250 meters. This means that the circumference of the wheel multiplied by the number of rotations equals the total distance traveled. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 25 * C = 3250, where C is the circumference of the wheel.

## Step 4: Solve for the circumference of the wheel
Divide both sides of the equation by 25 to solve for C: C = 3250 / 25 = 130 meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the diameter of the wheel
The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = π * d, where d is the diameter. We can rearrange this formula to solve for d: d = C / π. Substituting the value of C, we get d = 130 / π.

## Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the diameter
Using the approximate value of π as 3.14159, we can calculate the diameter: d = 130 / 3.14159 ≈ 41.37 meters.

## Step 2: Identify the given information.
The initial mass of blue vitriol is 249.5 grams, and the final mass of white powder produced is 150 grams.

## Step 3: Determine the theoretical yield.
To calculate the percentage yield, we first need to determine the theoretical yield, which is the maximum amount of product that can be formed from the given reactant. However, since the problem does not provide the chemical equation or the molar masses of the reactants and products, we will assume that the given mass of white powder is the actual yield.

## Step 4: Calculate the percentage yield.
The percentage yield can be calculated using the formula: (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100. However, since we do not have the theoretical yield, we can use the given masses to calculate the percentage yield based on the mass ratio. The formula becomes: (actual yield / initial mass of reactant) * 100.

The problem states that a stone is dropped from a tower of 2000 meters height. We need to find out how long it will take for the stone to hit the ground, given the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 10 m/s^2.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant physical quantities and the equation to use.
The initial velocity (v0) of the stone is 0 m/s since it is dropped from rest. The acceleration (a) due to gravity is given as 10 m/s^2. The distance (s) the stone travels is the height of the tower, which is 2000 meters. We can use the equation of motion s = v0*t + 0.5*a*t^2 to solve for time (t), where v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the equation of motion.
Given that v0 = 0 m/s, a = 10 m/s^2, and s = 2000 m, we substitute these values into the equation: 2000 = 0*t + 0.5*10*t^2.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for time (t).
Simplifying the equation gives us 2000 = 5*t^2. To solve for t, we divide both sides by 5, resulting in 400 = t^2. Taking the square root of both sides gives us t = sqrt(400).

## Step 5: Calculate the square root of 400 to find the time.
The square root of 400 is 20. Therefore, it will take 20 seconds for the stone to hit the ground.

The problem states that a car increases its speed from 36 km/h to 72 km/h in 1 minute and then further increases its speed to 108 km/h in the next 1 minute. We need to find the acceleration of the car.

## Step 2: Convert the time from minutes to hours to match the units of speed in km/h.
1 minute is equal to 1/60 hours. So, the time taken for each increase in speed is 1/60 hours.

## Step 3: Calculate the change in speed (Δv) for each interval.
From 36 km/h to 72 km/h, Δv = 72 - 36 = 36 km/h.
From 72 km/h to 108 km/h, Δv = 108 - 72 = 36 km/h.

## Step 4: Calculate the acceleration (a) using the formula a = Δv / Δt, where Δt is the time taken for the change in speed.
For the first interval, a = 36 km/h / (1/60) hours = 36 * 60 = 2160 km/h^2.
For the second interval, a = 36 km/h / (1/60) hours = 36 * 60 = 2160 km/h^2.

## Step 5: Since the acceleration is the same in both intervals, we can confirm that the acceleration of the car is consistent.
Given that acceleration is constant over both intervals, we can use either calculation. Thus, the acceleration of the car is 2160 km/h^2.

## Step 6: Convert the acceleration into a more standard unit, such as meters per second squared (m/s^2), if necessary. However, since the question does not specify the unit of acceleration, we will assume km/h^2 is acceptable for the answer.
1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s = 5/18 m/s. Thus, 1 km/h^2 = (5/18)^2 m/s^2 = 25/324 m/s^2. But, to keep the answer simple and as the question does not ask for conversion, we'll proceed with the understanding that the acceleration is given in km/h^2.

## Step 2: Identify the given values and relationships.
Given values are: mass (m) = 5 x 10^-2 kg, initial temperature (T1) = 20°C, final temperature (T2) = 100°C, and the amount of heat (Q) = 1520 Joules. The relationship between heat, mass, and temperature change is given by the formula Q = mcΔT, where c is the specific heat capacity of the substance.

The problem states: ""There are 12 blue balls, 16 white balls, and 20 black balls in a bag. What is the probability of picking a blue ball when one ball is randomly selected?""

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of balls in the bag.
To find the probability of picking a blue ball, we first need to determine the total number of balls in the bag. The total number of balls is the sum of blue, white, and black balls. total_balls = 12 (blue) + 16 (white) + 20 (black) = 48.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant physical principle
The relevant physical principle here is the equation of motion under constant acceleration, specifically for an object thrown upwards with initial velocity v0, where the acceleration due to gravity (g) is -9.8 m/s^2 (negative because it acts in the opposite direction of the initial velocity). The equation to find the maximum height (h) is v^2 = v0^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height), v0 is the initial velocity (19.6 m/s), a is the acceleration (-9.8 m/s^2), and s is the displacement (height) from the starting point.

## Step 3: Apply the equation of motion to solve for the maximum height
We set the final velocity v to 0 (since at the maximum height, the object's velocity is 0), v0 to 19.6 m/s, and a to -9.8 m/s^2. The equation becomes 0^2 = 19.6^2 + 2*(-9.8)*s.

## Step 4: Solve for s (the maximum height)
This simplifies to 0 = 384.16 - 19.6s. Rearranging the equation to solve for s gives us 19.6s = 384.16, and thus s = 384.16 / 19.6.

The problem states that an object of 10 grams mass is dropped from a height of 60 meters above the ground. We need to find the height from the ground at which the potential energy of the object will be five times its kinetic energy.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant physical principles
The potential energy (PE) of an object is given by the formula PE = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height above the ground. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula KE = 0.5mv^2, where v is the velocity of the object.

## Step 3: Determine the velocity of the object at any height
As the object falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At any height h, the sum of the potential and kinetic energies remains constant and equal to the initial potential energy at 60 meters. We can use the conservation of energy principle to relate the potential and kinetic energies at any height.

## Step 4: Apply the conservation of energy principle
The total energy (E) of the object at any height is given by E = PE + KE = mgh + 0.5mv^2. Since energy is conserved, the total energy at any height is equal to the initial potential energy at 60 meters: mgh + 0.5mv^2 = mg(60).

## Step 5: Solve for the velocity at any height
Rearranging the equation from Step 4, we get 0.5mv^2 = mg(60 - h). Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(2g(60 - h)).

## Step 6: Set up the equation for the potential energy to be five times the kinetic energy
We want to find the height at which PE = 5KE. Substituting the formulas for PE and KE, we get mgh = 5(0.5mv^2). Substituting the expression for v from Step 5, we get mgh = 5(0.5m(2g(60 - h))) = 5mg(60 - h).

## Step 7: Simplify and solve the equation for h

When rolling a fair six-sided die, there are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

## Step 3: Identify the favorable outcomes for getting an odd number.
The odd numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes for getting an odd number.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting an odd number.
The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability of getting an odd number is 3 (favorable outcomes) divided by 6 (total outcomes), which simplifies to 1/2.

The problem states: ""If 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved in a 500 ml solution, what is the density of the solution?""

## Step 2: Understand the given information
We have 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) dissolved in 500 ml of solution. To find the density of the solution, we need to know the total mass of the solution and its volume.

## Step 3: Calculate the mass of the solvent
Since the problem doesn't specify the solvent, we'll assume it's water for simplicity. The density of water is approximately 1 g/ml. Therefore, the mass of 500 ml of water is 500 g.

## Step 4: Calculate the total mass of the solution
The total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of sulfuric acid and the mass of the solvent (water). total_mass = mass_of_H2SO4 + mass_of_water = 24.5 g + 500 g = 524.5 g.

## Step 5: Calculate the density of the solution
The density of a substance is defined! as its mass per unit volume. The formula for density is density = mass / volume. Given that the volume of the solution is 500 ml (or 0.5 liters), we can calculate the density. First, convert the volume to the same unit as the mass for consistency; since 1 ml of water has a mass of 1 gram, 500 ml of solution will have a volume of 0.5 kg (considering 1 liter = 1 kg for water, approximately). However, to maintain precision with the given data, we'll keep the volume in ml and mass in grams for the calculation: density = total_mass / volume = 524.5 g / 500 ml.

## Step 6: Perform the calculation
density = 524.5 g / 500 ml = 1.049 g/ml.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.049}$"

The problem states: ""A natural number is randomly selected from 10 to 21. What is the probability that the number is divisible by 2 or 3?""

## Step 2: Identify the total number of outcomes.
To find the total number of outcomes, we need to count how many natural numbers there are from 10 to 21, inclusive. Since the numbers are consecutive, we can calculate this by subtracting the starting number from the ending number and then adding 1. Thus, there are 21 - 10 + 1 = 12 total outcomes.

## Step 3: Determine the numbers divisible by 2.
The numbers divisible by 2 from 10 to 21 are 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. There are 6 such numbers.

## Step 4: Determine the numbers divisible by 3.
The numbers divisible by 3 from 10 to 21 are 12, 15, 18, and 21. There are 4 such numbers.

## Step 5: Identify any overlap between the numbers divisible by 2 and 3.
The numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., divisible by 6) from 10 to 21 are 12 and 18. There are 2 such numbers.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.
To find the total number of favorable outcomes (numbers divisible by 2 or 3), we add the numbers of outcomes divisible by 2 and those divisible by 3 and then subtract the overlap to avoid double counting. Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes is 6 (divisible by 2) + 4 (divisible by 3) - 2 (divisible by both) = 8.

## Step 7: Calculate the probability.
The probability that a randomly selected number from 10 to 21 is divisible by 2 or 3 is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. Thus, the probability is 8 / 12, which simplifies to 2 / 3.

The problem states that a metallic solid sphere with a diameter of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder with a height of 4 cm. We need to find the curved surface area of the resulting cylinder.

## Step 2: Calculate the radius of the sphere
The diameter of the sphere is given as 6 cm, so the radius of the sphere (r) is half of the diameter, which is 6 / 2 = 3 cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the sphere
The volume of a sphere (V) is given by the formula V = (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the value of r, we get V = (4/3) * π * (3)^3 = (4/3) * π * 27 = 36π cubic cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the cylinder
The volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the sphere, as the sphere is melted to form the cylinder. So, the volume of the cylinder is also 36π cubic cm.

## Step 5: Calculate the radius of the cylinder
The height of the cylinder (h) is given as 4 cm. The volume of a cylinder (V) is given by the formula V = π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius of the cylinder. We can rearrange this formula to solve for r: r^2 = V / (π * h). Substituting the values of V and h, we get r^2 = 36π / (π * 4) = 36 / 4 = 9. Taking the square root of both sides, we get r = √9 = 3 cm.

## Step 6: Calculate the curved surface area of the cylinder
The curved surface area of a cylinder (A) is given by the formula A = 2 * π * r * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. Substituting the values of r and h, we get A = 2 * π * 3 * 4 = 24π square cm.

The problem states: ""6.02 x 10^23 particles of oxygen atoms' mass is how much?""

## Step 2: Understand the given values and units.
We are given the Avogadro's number, which is 6.02 x 10^23, representing the number of particles (in this case, oxygen atoms) in one mole of a substance. The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16 u (unified atomic mass units), where u is defined as one-twelfth the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

## Step 3: Determine the molar mass of oxygen.
Since oxygen is a diatomic molecule (O2), its molar mass is twice the atomic mass of oxygen, which is approximately 32 g/mol (grams per mole).

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen atoms.
To find the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen atoms, we first need to calculate the mass of one mole of oxygen atoms and then use the Avogadro's number. However, given that the question likely intends to ask for the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen molecules (since it mentions ""particles"" without specifying atoms or molecules, but the context usually implies molecules for such large numbers), we proceed with the understanding that we're dealing with oxygen molecules (O2) for a direct calculation relevant to typical chemistry problems.

## Step 5: Clarify the calculation based on common interpretations of similar problems.
If we interpret the problem as asking for the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen molecules (O2), the calculation is straightforward: the mass of one mole of O2 is approximately 32 grams. The Avogadro's number (6.02 x 10^23) represents the number of molecules in one mole. Thus, the mass of 6.02 x 10^23 oxygen molecules would indeed be the molar mass of oxygen, which is 32 grams, because Avogadro's number is defined as the number of units (in this case, molecules) in one mole.

The problem asks for the percentage composition of oxygen in sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

## Step 2: Determine the molecular weight of NaOH
To find the percentage composition of oxygen in NaOH, we first need to calculate the molecular weight of NaOH. The atomic weights are approximately: Sodium (Na) = 23, Oxygen (O) = 16, and Hydrogen (H) = 1.

## Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of NaOH
The molecular formula for sodium hydroxide is NaOH. So, the molecular weight of NaOH = Na + O + H = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40.

## Step 4: Calculate the weight of oxygen in NaOH
The weight of oxygen in one molecule of NaOH is 16 (since there is one oxygen atom).

The problem asks for the value of gravitational acceleration 500 km above the Earth's surface, given the Earth's mass as 5.98 x 10^24 kg and its radius as 6.37 x 10^6 meters.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for gravitational acceleration.
The formula for gravitational acceleration (g) at a certain height (h) above the Earth's surface is given by g = G * M / (r + h)^2, where G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2), M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the radius of the Earth.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula.
First, convert the height from kilometers to meters: 500 km = 500,000 meters. The Earth's mass (M) is given as 5.98 x 10^24 kg, and the Earth's radius (r) is given as 6.37 x 10^6 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the gravitational acceleration at the given height.
Using the formula g = G * M / (r + h)^2, substitute the given values: g = (6.674 x 10^-11) * (5.98 x 10^24) / ((6.37 x 10^6) + (5.00 x 10^5))^2.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation.
First, calculate the denominator: (6.37 x 10^6) + (5.00 x 10^5) = 6.37 x 10^6 + 0.5 x 10^6 = 6.87 x 10^6 meters.
Then, calculate (6.87 x 10^6)^2 = 47.1769 x 10^12 meters^2.
Next, calculate the numerator: (6.674 x 10^-11) * (5.98 x 10^24) = 39.89132 x 10^13 N*m^2.
Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator to find g: g = (39.89132 x 10^13) / (47.1769 x 10^12) = 8.465 m/s^2 (approximately).

The problem states that while measuring the length of a rod, the main scale reading is 8 cm and the vernier scale reading is 4. Given that the vernier constant is 0.01 cm, we need to find the length of the rod in centimeters.

## Step 2: Understand the concept of vernier scale and its constant.
The vernier scale is a device used to measure lengths with greater precision. The vernier constant represents the smallest unit of measurement that can be achieved using the vernier scale. It is the difference between one main scale division and one vernier scale division.

## Step 3: Calculate the length measured by the vernier scale.
Since the vernier scale reading is 4 and the vernier constant is 0.01 cm, we can calculate the additional length measured by the vernier scale as 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 cm.

## Step 4: Add the main scale reading and the vernier scale measurement to find the total length of the rod.
To find the total length of the rod, we add the main scale reading (8 cm) to the length measured by the vernier scale (0.04 cm). total_length = main_scale_reading + vernier_scale_measurement = 8 + 0.04 = 8.04 cm.

The problem states that the atmospheric pressure at a certain place is 93296 Pascals. The density of kerosene is 800 kg/m³, and the density of benzene is 980 kg/m³. We need to find the height of the mercury column.

## Step 2: Understand the concept of atmospheric pressure and density
Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on a unit area of the Earth's surface. The density of a substance is its mass per unit volume. In this case, we are given the densities of kerosene and benzene, but we are actually interested in mercury, as it is commonly used in barometers to measure atmospheric pressure.

## Step 3: Identify the density of mercury
The density of mercury is approximately 13600 kg/m³. This value is crucial for calculating the height of the mercury column, as the atmospheric pressure is directly related to the weight of the mercury column.

## Step 4: Apply the formula for atmospheric pressure
The formula for atmospheric pressure (P) in terms of the density of the fluid (ρ) and the height of the column (h) is P = ρgh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).

## Step 5: Rearrange the formula to solve for height
To find the height of the mercury column, we rearrange the formula: h = P / (ρg).

## Step 6: Plug in the values

The problem states that the sum of two angles is 60 degrees and their difference is 30 degrees. We need to find the measure of the larger angle.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the angles.
Let's denote the larger angle as L and the smaller angle as S.

## Step 3: Formulate equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two equations:
1. L + S = 60 (sum of the angles)
2. L - S = 30 (difference of the angles)

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the larger angle.
We can solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute into the other. Let's solve equation (2) for L:
L = S + 30

## Step 5: Substitute the expression for L from Step 4 into equation (1).
Substituting L = S + 30 into the equation L + S = 60 gives:
(S + 30) + S = 60

## Step 6: Simplify and solve the resulting equation for S.
Combine like terms:
2S + 30 = 60
Subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 30
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 15

## Step 7: Find the larger angle L using the value of S.
Now that we know S = 15, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find L. Using L - S = 30:
L - 15 = 30
Add 15 to both sides:
L = 45

## Step 8: Confirm that L is indeed the larger angle and calculate the final answer.
Since L (45 degrees) is greater than S (15 degrees), L is the measure of the larger angle.

The problem states that 40 grams of sodium metal and 35.5 grams of chlorine gas are placed in a container. After reacting in a suitable environment, sodium chloride is produced. We need to find out how many grams of sodium chloride will be produced.

## Step 2: Determine the chemical equation for the reaction between sodium and chlorine.
The reaction between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) produces sodium chloride (NaCl). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: 2Na + Cl2 -> 2NaCl.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of sodium and chlorine.
To calculate the number of moles, we use the formula: moles = mass / molar mass. The molar mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 22.98 g/mol, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl2) is approximately 70.90 g/mol.
- Moles of sodium = 40 g / 22.98 g/mol = 1.74 mol.
- Moles of chlorine = 35.5 g / 70.90 g/mol = 0.50 mol.

## Step 4: Determine the limiting reactant.
From the balanced equation, we see that 2 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of chlorine. Given the moles calculated:
- Sodium required to react with 0.50 mol of Cl2 = 0.50 mol * 2 = 1 mol of Na.
Since 1.74 mol of Na is available, which is more than the 1 mol required, chlorine (0.50 mol) is the limiting reactant.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of sodium chloride produced.
The balanced equation shows that 1 mole of Cl2 produces 2 moles of NaCl. The molar mass of NaCl is approximately 58.44 g/mol.
- Moles of NaCl = 2 * moles of Cl2 = 2 * 0.50 = 1 mol.
- Mass of NaCl = moles of NaCl * molar mass of NaCl = 1 mol * 58.44 g/mol = 58.44 g.

The problem states that on a slide caliper, 19 divisions on the main scale are equal to 20 divisions on the Vernier scale. When a small rod is placed between the jaws, it is observed that the zero mark on the Vernier scale overlaps the 5.2 cm mark on the main scale. Furthermore, the 14th mark on the Vernier scale coincides with a zero on the main scale. We are asked to find the Vernier constant in millimeters.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the main scale and the Vernier scale.
The Vernier scale is designed to measure smaller lengths by dividing the smallest unit of the main scale into smaller parts. The Vernier constant is the difference between one division on the main scale and one division on the Vernier scale.

## Step 3: Determine the least count of the main scale.
Since 19 divisions on the main scale are equal to 20 divisions on the Vernier scale, we first need to find the least count of the main scale. However, to find the Vernier constant, we need to understand that the least count of the Vernier scale is the smallest unit of measurement it can provide, which is related to but smaller than the least count of the main scale.

## Step 4: Calculate the least count of the Vernier scale.
Given that the zero error is 5.2 cm (or 52 mm) and this error is equivalent to 14 divisions on the Vernier scale, we can set up a relationship to find the Vernier constant. However, the direct calculation of the Vernier constant from the given information involves understanding that the difference between the main scale and Vernier scale divisions is what allows for the precise measurement.

## Step 5: Apply the formula for Vernier constant.
The Vernier constant (VC) can be found using the formula: VC = (1 main scale division) / (number of Vernier scale divisions that equal 1 main scale division). However, in this scenario, we're given a situation that implies the Vernier scale's least count is related to the difference it measures between the main scale marks.

## Step 6: Use the given information about the zero error and the coincidence of the 14th Vernier mark with a main scale mark to calculate the Vernier constant.
Since 19 main scale divisions = 20 Vernier scale divisions, and considering the zero error and the coincidence point, we calculate"

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the arc length of a circle.
The arc length (L) of a circle can be found using the formula L = θ × (π × r) / 180, where θ is the central angle in degrees, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.

## Step 3: Rearrange the formula to solve for the central angle θ.
To find θ, we rearrange the formula: θ = (L × 180) / (π × r).

## Step 4: Plug in the given values into the rearranged formula.
Given that L = 14 cm and r = 7 cm, we substitute these values into the formula: θ = (14 × 180) / (π × 7).

## Step 5: Perform the calculation.
Now, calculate θ: θ = (14 × 180) / (3.14159 × 7) = 2520 / 21.99113 ≈ 114.59 degrees.

## Step 6: Round the answer to a reasonable number of decimal places, if necessary.
Since the problem doesn't specify the number of decimal places to round to, we will provide the answer as a whole number or with one decimal place for simplicity. However, in this format, the final answer should be a numerical value without elaboration on rounding.

The problem asks us to determine the amount of water formed in grams from the combination of 1 mole of ethanol and 1 mole of oxygen.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the combustion of ethanol.
The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethanol is: C2H5OH + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O.

## Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant.
From the equation, we see that 1 mole of ethanol requires 3 moles of oxygen to completely combust. However, we only have 1 mole of oxygen available. Therefore, oxygen is the limiting reactant in this reaction.

## Step 4: Calculate the amount of water formed based on the limiting reactant.
Since 3 moles of oxygen produce 3 moles of water, 1 mole of oxygen will produce 1 mole of water.

## Step 5: Calculate the molar mass of water.
The molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18 grams/mole (2*1 for hydrogen + 16 for oxygen).

## Step 6: Calculate the mass of water formed.
Given that 1 mole of oxygen produces 1 mole of water, and the molar mass of water is 18 grams/mole, the mass of water formed is 1 mole * 18 grams/mole = 18 grams.

The problem translates to ""What is the mass of water associated with one molecule of sulfuric acid?"" However, the Bengali term ""তুঁতে"" is more accurately translated to ""sulfuric acid"" or ""H2SO4"" in English, but in the context of the question, it seems to refer to a molecule or an atom related to sulfur, possibly ""sulfur"" itself or a compound containing sulfur.

## Step 2: Identify the molecular structure of sulfuric acid.
Sulfuric acid has the chemical formula H2SO4, indicating it consists of 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 sulfur atom, and 4 oxygen atoms.

## Step 3: Determine the mass of one molecule of sulfuric acid.
To find the mass of one molecule of sulfuric acid, we need the atomic masses of hydrogen (H), sulfur (S), and oxygen (O). The atomic masses are approximately: H = 1.00794 u, S = 32.065 u, and O = 15.9994 u.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of one molecule of sulfuric acid.
The mass of one molecule of H2SO4 is calculated as follows:
- Mass of 2 hydrogen atoms = 2 * 1.00794 u = 2.01588 u
- Mass of 1 sulfur atom = 32.065 u
- Mass of 4 oxygen atoms = 4 * 15.9994 u = 63.9976 u
- Total mass = 2.01588 u + 32.065 u + 63.9976 u = 98.07848 u

## Step 5: Address the question's focus on water's mass associated with one molecule of sulfuric acid.
The question seems to imply the mass of water (H2O) associated with one molecule of sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) does not directly ""contain"" water in its molecular structure, but when considering chemical reactions or dilutions involving sulfuric acid, water is often involved. However, if interpreting the question as asking for the mass of water that would react with or dilute one molecule of sulfuric acid, it's not directly answerable without a specific chemical context (like neutralization reactions).

The problem states: ""A person of 70 kg mass climbs a 100 meter high mountain in 5 minutes. What is his power in watts? The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2.""

## Step 2: Understand the concept of power and its formula
Power is defined as the rate of doing work. The formula for power is P = W / t, where P is the power, W is the work done, and t is the time taken. Work done (W) can be calculated using the formula W = F * d, where F is the force applied and d is the distance over which the force is applied.

## Step 3: Calculate the force applied by the person
Since the person is climbing against gravity, the force applied is equal to the weight of the person, which is given by F = m * g, where m is the mass of the person (70 kg) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2).

## Step 4: Calculate the work done by the person
The work done by the person is W = F * d = m * g * d, where d is the height of the mountain (100 m).

## Step 5: Calculate the work done
Substituting the values, W = 70 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m = 68600 J.

## Step 6: Convert the time from minutes to seconds
The time taken is 5 minutes, which is equal to 5 * 60 = 300 seconds.

## Step 7: Calculate the power
Now, we can calculate the power using the formula P = W / t = 68600 J / 300 s.

## Step 8: Perform the calculation
P = 68600 / 300 = 228.67 W.

The problem states that a 1 kilowatt motor is used to lift a 100 kg object 10 meters upwards in 15 seconds. We need to calculate the energy loss in joules.

## Step 2: Calculate the work done by the motor in lifting the object.
To find the work done, we use the formula: Work = Force * Distance. Since the force is due to the weight of the object, we calculate it as Force = mass * acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s^2). So, Force = 100 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 981 N. The distance is given as 10 meters. Therefore, Work = 981 N * 10 m = 9810 J.

## Step 3: Calculate the energy input by the motor.
The power of the motor is given as 1 kilowatt, which is 1000 watts. The time for which the motor operates is 15 seconds. Using the formula: Energy = Power * Time, we find Energy = 1000 W * 15 s = 15000 J.

## Step 4: Calculate the energy loss.
The energy loss can be found by subtracting the work done from the energy input. Therefore, Energy loss = Energy input - Work done = 15000 J - 9810 J = 5190 J.

However, it seems there might be a slight translation error because ""ফেরিক কার্বনেট"" translates more accurately to ""ferric carbonate"" rather than ""ferric oxide."" Ferric carbonate is Fe2(CO3)3, and ferric oxide, commonly known as iron(III) oxide or hematite, is Fe2O3. Given the context, let's proceed with the assumption that the question is about ferric carbonate.

## Step 2: Determine the chemical formula of ferric carbonate.
The chemical formula for ferric carbonate is Fe2(CO3)3. This means each molecule of ferric carbonate contains 2 iron atoms, 3 carbon atoms, and 9 oxygen atoms (since each carbonate ion, CO3, contains 1 carbon and 3 oxygen atoms).

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of atoms in one molecule of ferric carbonate.
To find the total number of atoms in one molecule of ferric carbonate, we add the number of iron, carbon, and oxygen atoms together. So, we have 2 iron atoms, 3 carbon atoms, and 9 oxygen atoms.

## Step 4: Perform the addition to get the total number of atoms.

The formula for the space diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid is given by \(d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}\), where \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height of the solid.

## Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula.

The problem states that a stone is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 9.8 m/s. We need to find out how long it will take for the stone to return to the ground.

## Step 2: Identify the key parameters and formulas to be used for the solution.
To solve this problem, we can use the equation of motion under gravity, which is given by: s = ut + 0.5gt^2, where s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity, t is the time, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2). Since the stone is thrown upward, the initial velocity is 9.8 m/s, and we want to find the time it takes for the stone to return to the ground, which means the displacement (s) will be 0 (since it ends up back where it started).

## Step 3: Apply the equation of motion to find the time it takes for the stone to return to the ground.
Using the equation s = ut + 0.5gt^2 and substituting the given values (u = 9.8 m/s, g = 9.8 m/s^2, and s = 0), we get: 0 = 9.8t - 0.5*9.8*t^2. Simplifying this equation gives us: 0 = 9.8t - 4.9t^2.

## Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation for time (t).
Rearranging the equation from step 3 gives us: 4.9t^2 - 9.8t = 0. Factoring out t, we get: t(4.9t - 9.8) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions for t: t = 0 (which is the moment the stone is thrown) and 4.9t - 9.8 = 0. Solving for the positive time, we get: 4.9t = 9.8, which leads to t = 9.8 / 4.9 = 2.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cylinder
The volume of a cylinder (V) is given by the formula V = π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. Since the cylinder is formed by melting the sphere, their volumes are equal. So, we can equate the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder: 36π = π * (1)^2 * h. Simplifying, we get h = 36.

The problem asks how many grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) need to be added to 2 liters of solution to make it semimolar.

## Step 2: Understand what semimolar means.
A semimolar solution is a solution that has a concentration of 0.5 moles of solute per liter of solution. Since we are dealing with sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a strong electrolyte that completely dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions in water, we consider the dissociation but for concentration calculations, we treat it as a single entity.

## Step 3: Calculate the total moles of NaCl required for 2 liters to be semimolar.
Since the solution needs to be semimolar (0.5 M), and we have 2 liters of solution, the total moles of NaCl required is calculated as follows: moles = molarity * volume (in liters) = 0.5 M * 2 L = 1 mole.

## Step 4: Calculate the molar mass of NaCl.
The molar mass of NaCl is the sum of the atomic masses of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). The atomic mass of Na is approximately 22.99 g/mol, and the atomic mass of Cl is approximately 35.45 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol = 58.44 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of NaCl needed.
To find out how many grams of NaCl are needed to make 2 liters of solution semimolar, we multiply the number of moles required (from Step 3) by the molar mass of NaCl (from Step 4): mass = moles * molar mass = 1 mole * 58.44 g/mol = 58.44 grams.

The problem states that a 5 kg gun fires a 20 gram bullet at a speed of 500 m/s over a period of 0.1 seconds. We need to find the magnitude of the force exerted by the gun on the bullet.

## Step 2: Convert the mass of the bullet to kilograms for consistency.
The mass of the bullet is 20 grams, which is 0.02 kg (since 1 kg! = 1000 grams).

## Step 3: Calculate the change in momentum of the bullet.
The initial momentum of the bullet is 0 (since it is initially at rest). The final momentum of the bullet can be calculated using the formula: momentum = mass * velocity. So, the final momentum is 0.02 kg * 500 m/s = 10 kg*m/s.

## Step 4: Calculate the force exerted on the bullet using the impulse-momentum theorem.
The impulse-momentum theorem states that the force exerted on an object is equal to the change in momentum divided by the time over which the force is applied. The change in momentum is 10 kg*m/s (from 0 to 10 kg*m/s), and the time is 0.1 seconds. So, the force exerted on the bullet is 10 kg*m/s / 0.1 s = 100 N.

## Step 5: According to Newton's third law of motion, the force exerted by the gun on the bullet is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the bullet on the gun. Therefore, the magnitude of the force exerted by the gun on the bullet is also 100 N.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"

The problem translates to: ""How many grams of oxygen will react with 12 grams of magnesium?""

## Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction between magnesium and oxygen.
The chemical reaction between magnesium (Mg) and oxygen (O2) is: 2Mg + O2 → 2MgO.

## Step 3: Calculate the molar masses of magnesium and oxygen.
The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.31 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O2) is approximately 32 g/mol (since oxygen is diatomic, its molar mass is 2 * 16 = 32 g/mol).

## Step 4: Determine the number of moles of magnesium.
Given 12 grams of magnesium, we calculate the number of moles of magnesium: moles = mass / molar mass = 12 g / 24.31 g/mol.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation for the number of moles of magnesium.
moles_of_magnesium = 12 g / 24.31 g/mol ≈ 0.493 mol.

## Step 6: Use the balanced chemical equation to find the mole ratio between magnesium and oxygen.
From the equation 2Mg + O2 → 2MgO, for every 2 moles of magnesium, 1 mole of oxygen is required. So, the mole ratio of Mg to O2 is 2:1.

## Step 7: Calculate the number of moles of oxygen required to react with the magnesium.
Since 2 moles of Mg require 1 mole of O2, 0.493 mol of Mg will require (0.493 mol / 2) * 1 = 0.2465 mol of O2.

## Step 8: Calculate the mass of oxygen required.
Using the molar mass of oxygen (32 g/mol), the mass of oxygen required is: mass = moles * molar mass = 0.2465 mol * 32 g/mol.

## Step 9: Perform the calculation for the mass of oxygen.
mass_of_oxygen = 0.2465 mol * 32 g/mol ≈ 7.888 g.

The problem states that the length of the diagonal of a square is 4√2 cm, and we are asked to find the area of the square.

## Step 2: Recall the relationship between the diagonal and the side length of a square
In a square, the diagonal (d) and the side length (s) are related by the Pythagorean theorem: d^2 = s^2 + s^2, which simplifies to d^2 = 2s^2.

## Step 3: Use the given diagonal length to find the side length of the square
Given that the diagonal length d = 4√2 cm, we can substitute this value into the equation from Step 2: (4√2)^2 = 2s^2. This simplifies to 32 = 2s^2.

## Step 4: Solve for the side length
Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for s^2: s^2 = 32 / 2 = 16. Then, take the square root of both sides to find s: s = √16 = 4 cm.

## Step 5: Calculate the area of the square
The area (A) of a square is given by A = s^2, where s is the side length. Since we found that s = 4 cm, the area is A = 4^2 = 16 square cm.

The problem states that a 0.125 molar solution of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is prepared in 750 ml of solution. When hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to the solution, we need to find out how many grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) will be produced.

## Step 2: Write down the chemical equation for the reaction
The reaction between potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) can be represented by the following equation:
K2CO3 + 2HCl -> 2KCl + CO2 + H2O

## Step 3: Determine the number of moles of potassium carbonate
Given that the solution is 0.125 molar and the volume is 750 ml (or 0.75 liters), we can calculate the number of moles of K2CO3:
Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.125 M * 0.75 L = 0.09375 mol

## Step 4: Calculate the number of moles of carbon dioxide produced
From the chemical equation, we see that 1 mole of K2CO3 produces 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the number of moles of CO2 produced will be equal to the number of moles of K2CO3:
Moles of CO2 = Moles of K2CO3 = 0.09375 mol

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of carbon dioxide produced
The molar mass of CO2 is approximately 44 g/mol. We can calculate the mass of CO2 produced by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass:
Mass of CO2 = Moles of CO2 * Molar mass of CO2 = 0.09375 mol * 44 g/mol = 4.125 g

The problem states that a 1 kg toy car is moving at a speed of 1 m/s on a frictionless floor. A force of 1 Newton is applied in the direction of the car's motion. We need to find the change in energy of the car 5 seconds after the force is applied.

## Step 2: Calculate the initial kinetic energy of the car
The initial kinetic energy (KE) of the car can be calculated using the formula: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the car (1 kg) and v is the initial velocity (1 m/s). Therefore, KE = 0.5 * 1 * 1^2 = 0.5 Joules.

## Step 3: Calculate the acceleration of the car
Since a force of 1 Newton is applied to the car, we can calculate the acceleration (a) using the formula: F = m * a, where F is the force (1 N) and m is the mass (1 kg). Rearranging the formula to solve for a, we get: a = F / m = 1 / 1 = 1 m/s^2.

## Step 4: Calculate the final velocity of the car after 5 seconds
Using the formula: v = u + a * t, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (1 m/s), a is the acceleration (1 m/s^2), and t is the time (5 seconds), we can calculate the final velocity: v = 1 + 1 * 5 = 6 m/s.

## Step 5: Calculate the final kinetic energy of the car
Using the same formula as in Step 2, we can calculate the final kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 = 0.5 * 1 * 6^2 = 18 Joules.

## Step 6: Calculate the change in energy of the car
The change in energy is the difference between the final and initial kinetic energies: ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial = 18 - 0.5 = 17.5 Joules.

The problem states: ""If the mass of an atom of a certain element is 4.482 x 10^-23 grams, what will be its relative atomic mass?""

## Step 2: Understand the concept of relative atomic mass
Relative atomic mass is the ratio of the mass of an atom of a given element to one-twelfth the mass of an atom of carbon-12. However, for simplification and historical reasons, it's often approximated by comparing the mass of an atom of the element to the mass of a hydrogen atom or using the unified atomic mass unit (u), where 1 u = 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

## Step 3: Recall the definition of the unified atomic mass unit (u)
1 u is defined as one-twelfth the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The mass of a carbon-12 atom is approximately 1.992 x 10^-23 grams. Therefore, 1 u = (1.992 x 10^-23 grams) / 12.

## Step 4: Calculate the value of 1 u in grams
1 u = 1.992 x 10^-23 / 12 = 1.66 x 10^-24 grams.

## Step 5: Calculate the relative atomic mass of the given element
To find the relative atomic mass, we divide the mass of the atom of the given element by the mass of 1 u. Relative atomic mass = (4.482 x 10^-23 grams) / (1.66 x 10^-24 grams).

## Step 6: Perform the calculation
Relative atomic mass = (4.482 x 10^-23) / (1.66 x 10^-24) = 4.482 / 1.66 * 10^1 = 2.7 * 10^1 = 27.

The problem states that a spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half-submerged in water and floating. We need to find the density of the sphere in kilograms per cubic meter.

## Step 2: Recall the principle of buoyancy and Archimedes' Principle.
According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyant force exerted on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. For the sphere to float with half of its volume submerged, the weight of the water displaced must equal the weight of the sphere.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of water displaced by the sphere.
Since the sphere is half-submerged, the volume of water displaced is half the volume of the sphere, which is 200 cubic meters / 2 = 100 cubic meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the weight of the water displaced.
The weight of the water displaced can be calculated by multiplying the volume of water displaced by the density of water. The density of water is approximately 1000 kilograms per cubic meter. Therefore, the weight of the water displaced is 100 cubic meters * 1000 kilograms/cubic meter = 100,000 kilograms.

## Step 5: Equate the weight of the water displaced to the weight of the sphere.
Since the sphere is floating, the weight of the water displaced equals the weight of the sphere. The weight of the sphere is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity, but since we are comparing densities, we can directly compare the weights.

## Step 6: Calculate the density of the sphere.
The weight of the sphere is equal to the weight of the water displaced, which is 100,000 kilograms. The volume of the sphere is given as 200 cubic meters. The density of the sphere can be calculated by dividing the weight of the sphere by its volume: density = weight / volume = 100,000 kilograms / 200 cubic meters = 500 kilograms/cubic meter.

## Step 2: Recall the formula to calculate the length of an arc in a circle.
The formula to calculate the length of an arc is given by: arc length = (θ/360) * 2 * π * r, where θ is the angle subtended by the arc at the center of the circle in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.

## Step 3: Calculate the radius of the circle.
Given that the diameter of the circle is 2 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 2 / 2 = 1 cm.

Given that $s = 8$ cm and $r = 2$ cm, we can substitute these values into the formula $s = r\theta$ to find the central angle $\theta$. This gives us $8 = 2\theta$.

## Step 4: Solve for $\theta$.
To find $\theta$, we divide both sides of the equation $8 = 2\theta$ by 2, yielding $\theta = 4$ radians.

The problem translates to: ""To increase the kinetic energy of an object by 16 times, by how many times should the velocity be increased?""

## Step 2: Recall the formula for kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.

## Step 3: Determine the relationship between kinetic energy and velocity.
From the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, we can see that the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the velocity. This means if the kinetic energy is increased by a certain factor, the velocity must be increased by the square root of that factor to achieve the desired increase in kinetic energy.

## Step 4: Calculate the factor by which the velocity should be increased to increase the kinetic energy by 16 times.
Since the kinetic energy needs to be increased by 16 times, and kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, we find the factor by which the velocity should be increased by taking the square root of 16. The square root of 16 is 4.

## Step 5: Conclude the final numerical answer.
Therefore, to increase the kinetic energy of an object by 16 times, the velocity should be increased by 4 times.

The problem states that using a slide caliper, the main scale reading for measuring the thickness of a rectangular glass plate is 18 mm, and the vernier scale coincidence is 8. The vernier constant of the instrument is 0.01 cm. We need to find the thickness of the glass plate in mm.

## Step 2: Convert the vernier constant to mm
The vernier constant is given as 0.01 cm. To convert it to mm, we multiply by 10 since 1 cm = 10 mm. Therefore, the vernier constant in mm is 0.01 * 10 = 0.1 mm.

The problem states that two objects of masses 15 kg and 10 kg are moving towards each other on the same road with speeds of 3 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively. After a head-on collision, they stick together. We need to find the combined velocity of the objects after the collision.

## Step 2: Identify the principles to be applied.
The principle of conservation of momentum will be applied to solve this problem. According to this principle, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

## Step 3: Calculate the momentum of each object before the collision.
The momentum of an object is given by the product of its mass and velocity. For the 15 kg object, the momentum is 15 kg * 3 m/s = 45 kg*m/s. For the 10 kg object, the momentum is 10 kg * 5 m/s = 50 kg*m/s. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be considered as having opposite signs.

## Step 4: Apply the principle of conservation of momentum.
The total momentum before the collision is the sum of the momenta of the two objects, considering their directions. So, the total momentum before the collision is 45 kg*m/s - 50 kg*m/s = -5 kg*m/s.

## Step 5: Calculate the combined velocity after the collision.
After the collision, the two objects stick together, forming a single object of mass 15 kg + 10 kg = 25 kg. Let's denote the combined velocity after the collision as V. According to the principle of conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. So, -5 kg*m/s = 25 kg * V.

## Step 6: Solve for the combined velocity V.
To find V, we divide both sides of the equation by 25 kg. Thus, V = -5 kg*m/s / 25 kg = -0.2 m/s.

The English translation of the problem is: ""An object of 2 kg mass is dropped from rest and covers a distance of 36 meters in 3 seconds. What is the acceleration of the object in m/s^2?""

## Step 3: Recall the equations of motion under constant acceleration.
The equation that relates distance (s), initial velocity (v0), time (t), and acceleration (a) is: s = v0*t + 0.5*a*t^2. Since the object is dropped from rest, the initial velocity (v0) is 0.

## Step 4: Plug in the given values into the equation.
Given that the initial velocity (v0) is 0, distance (s) is 36 meters, and time (t) is 3 seconds, we can rewrite the equation as: 36 = 0*3 + 0.5*a*3^2.

## Step 5: Solve for acceleration (a).
Simplify the equation: 36 = 0.5*a*9. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 72 = 9*a. Divide both sides by 9 to solve for a: a = 72/9 = 8.

## Step 6: Consider the mass of the object and its relation to acceleration.
The mass of the object (2 kg) is given, but since the acceleration due to gravity (g) is the same for all objects regardless of their mass (assuming no air resistance), and we are solving for acceleration which is essentially g in this context, the mass does not directly factor into our calculation for acceleration.

The problem asks for the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid.

## Step 2: Identify the chemical formula of chloric acid
Chloric acid is represented by the chemical formula HClO3.

## Step 3: Determine the molar mass of chloric acid
To find the percentage of oxygen, we first need to calculate the molar mass of chloric acid. The atomic masses are approximately: Hydrogen (H) = 1 g/mol, Chlorine (Cl) = 35.5 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of HClO3 = 1 (H) + 35.5 (Cl) + 3*16 (O) = 1 + 35.5 + 48 = 84.5 g/mol.

## Step 4: Calculate the total mass of oxygen in chloric acid
Since there are three oxygen atoms in a molecule of chloric acid, the total mass of oxygen = 3 * 16 = 48 g/mol.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid
The percentage of oxygen = (mass of oxygen / molar mass of chloric acid) * 100 = (48 / 84.5) * 100.

## Step 6: Perform the calculation
Percentage of oxygen = (48 / 84.5) * 100 ≈ 56.8%.

The problem states: In a right-angled triangle, the base and hypotenuse are 12 and 13 respectively. We need to find the height (or the perpendicular) of the triangle.

## Step 2: Recall the Pythagorean theorem to relate the base, height, and hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), i.e., \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\). Here, we can denote the base as \(a = 12\), the hypotenuse as \(c = 13\), and the height (which we are trying to find) as \(b\).

## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the triangle.
Using the Pythagorean theorem \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\), we can substitute the given values: \(13^2 = 12^2 + b^2\). Solving for \(b^2\), we get \(169 = 144 + b^2\).

## Step 4: Solve for \(b^2\).
Subtract 144 from both sides of the equation to isolate \(b^2\): \(b^2 = 169 - 144\), which simplifies to \(b^2 = 25\).

The problem states that a stationary object with a constant mass of 2 kg is dropped from above and covers a distance of 36 meters in 3 seconds. We are asked to find the velocity of the object after 3 seconds.

## Step 2: Identify the type of motion and relevant equations.
Since the object is under the sole influence of gravity, this is an example of uniformly accelerated motion. The equation to find the distance covered (s) under uniform acceleration (a) in time (t) is s = ut + 0.5at^2, where u is the initial velocity (which is 0 since the object starts from rest).

## Step 3: Apply the given values to the equation.
Given that the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s, the time (t) is 3 seconds, and the distance (s) covered is 36 meters, we can substitute these values into the equation: 36 = 0 * 3 + 0.5 * a * 3^2.

## Step 4: Solve for acceleration (a).
Simplifying the equation from Step 3 gives 36 = 0 + 0.5 * a * 9. This further simplifies to 36 = 4.5a. Solving for a gives a = 36 / 4.5 = 8 m/s^2.

## Step 5: Calculate the final velocity using the equation v = u + at.
Since the acceleration due to gravity (a) is 8 m/s^2 (as calculated, but note that the standard value for g is approximately 9.81 m/s^2, the discrepancy might be due to rounding or an error in calculation), the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s, and the time (t) is 3 seconds, we can find the final velocity (v) using the equation v = u + at. Thus, v = 0 + 8 * 3.

v = 0 + 24 = 24 m/s.

## Step 2: Understand what a proper subset is
A proper subset of a set is a subset that is not equal to the set itself. In other words, it's a subset that contains some but not all elements of the original set.

## Step 3: Recall the formula for calculating the number of proper subsets
The formula for calculating the number of subsets (including the empty set and the set itself) of a set with n elements is 2^n. However, since we are looking for the number of proper subsets, we need to subtract 1 from this total to exclude the set itself. But we should also consider that the empty set is sometimes not counted as a proper subset in certain contexts. The general formula for proper subsets, excluding the set itself but including the empty set, is 2^n - 1.

## Step 4: Apply the formula for the number of proper subsets

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of balls in the bag.
To find the probability, we first need to determine the total number of balls in the bag. The total number of balls is the sum of white, black, and red balls. Total_balls = 15 (white) + 10 (black) + 20 (red) = 45 balls.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of white and red balls.
Since we are interested in the probability of selecting either a white or a red ball, we need to find the total number of white and red balls combined. Total_white_and_red = 15 (white) + 20 (red) = 35 balls.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of selecting a white or red ball.
The probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcomes are selecting either a white or a red ball, which we found to be 35. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls, which is 45. Therefore, the probability = Total_white_and_red / Total_balls = 35 / 45.

The problem states that a spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half-submerged in water and floating. We need to find the buoyancy of the sphere.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere.
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## Step 3: Calculate the radius of the sphere.
Given that the volume \(V = 200\) cubic meters, we can solve for \(r\):
\[200 = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
Rearranging for \(r^3\):
\[r^3 = \frac{200 \times 3}{4 \pi}\]
\[r^3 = \frac{600}{4 \pi}\]
\[r^3 = \frac{150}{\pi}\]
Taking the cube root of both sides:
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{150}{\pi}}\]

## Step 4: Understand the principle of buoyancy.
According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyancy force (or upward force) exerted on a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid the body displaces. For a sphere half-submerged in water, the volume of water displaced is half the volume of the sphere.

## Step 5: Calculate the volume of water displaced.
Since the sphere is half-submerged, the volume of water displaced \(V_{displaced} = \frac{1}{2} \times V_{sphere}\).
\[V_{displaced} = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 = 100 \, \text{cubic meters}\]

## Step 6: Calculate the weight of water displaced, which equals the buoyancy force.
The density of water \(\rho_{water} \approx 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\). The weight of water displaced (which is the buoyancy force \(F_b\)) is given by:
\[F_b = \rho_{water} \times g \times V_{displaced}\]
