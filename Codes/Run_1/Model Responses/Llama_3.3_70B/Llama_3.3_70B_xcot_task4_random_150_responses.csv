The problem asks for the smallest non-zero perfect square number that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60.

## Step 2: Find the prime factorization of the given numbers to understand their factors.
To find the smallest perfect square divisible by 25, 40, and 60, we first need to find the prime factorization of each number. 25 = 5^2, 40 = 2^3 * 5, and 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5.

## Step 3: Determine the factors needed for the perfect square.
For a number to be a perfect square, each prime factor must appear an even number of times. From the factorizations, we see that the smallest perfect square must include at least 2^2 (to cover 40 and 60), 3^2 (to cover 60, as 3 appears once in 60's factorization), and 5^2 (since 25 already has 5^2).

## Step 4: Calculate the smallest perfect square number.
Combining the minimum required factors for a perfect square: 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 4 * 9 * 25 = 900.

The final answer is: **900**"

The problem states that a shopkeeper buys fabric at a price of 125 Taka per meter and sells it at a price of 150 Taka per meter, resulting in a profit of 2000 Taka. We need to find the total number of meters of fabric the shopkeeper bought.

## Step 2: Calculate the profit per meter of fabric.
To find the profit per meter, we subtract the cost price from the selling price. Profit per meter = Selling price per meter - Cost price per meter = 150 Taka - 125 Taka = 25 Taka.

## Step 3: Determine the total number of meters of fabric bought.
We know that the total profit is 2000 Taka and the profit per meter is 25 Taka. To find the total number of meters, we divide the total profit by the profit per meter. Total meters = Total profit / Profit per meter = 2000 Taka / 25 Taka.

## Step 4: Perform the division to find the total number of meters.
Total meters = 2000 / 25 = 80.

The problem states that 5 years ago, the ratio of the father's age to the son's age was 3:1, and 15 years later, the ratio of their ages will be 2:1. We need to find the son's current age.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem
Let's denote the son's current age as S and the father's current age as F.

## Step 3: Establish the equation based on the first condition (5 years ago)
5 years ago, the son's age was S - 5, and the father's age was F - 5. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages 5 years ago was 3:1. So, we can write the equation as (F - 5) / (S - 5) = 3 / 1.

## Step 4: Establish the equation based on the second condition (15 years later)
15 years later, the son's age will be S + 15, and the father's age will be F + 15. The ratio of their ages at that time will be 2:1. So, we can write the equation as (F + 15) / (S + 15) = 2 / 1.

## Step 5: Simplify the first equation
From Step 3, we have (F - 5) / (S - 5) = 3 / 1. This simplifies to F - 5 = 3(S - 5), which further simplifies to F - 5 = 3S - 15. Rearranging gives us F = 3S - 10.

## Step 6: Simplify the second equation
From Step 4, we have (F + 15) / (S + 15) = 2 / 1. This simplifies to F + 15 = 2(S + 15), which further simplifies to F + 15 = 2S + 30. Rearranging gives us F = 2S + 15.

## Step 7: Solve the system of equations
Setting the two expressions for F equal to each other gives us 3S - 10 = 2S + 15. Solving for S, we subtract 2S from both sides to get S - 10 = 15. Adding 10 to"

The problem states that a goat is sold at a 10% loss. If the selling price were 450 rupees more, there would have been a 5% profit. We need to find the cost price of the goat.

## Step 2: Define the variables and set up the equation based on the given information.
Let's denote the cost price of the goat as CP. When the goat is sold at a 10% loss, the selling price (SP1) is 90% of the cost price. If the selling price were 450 rupees more, resulting in a 5% profit, the new selling price (SP2) would be 105% of the cost price. The difference between SP2 and SP1 is 450 rupees.

## Step 3: Formulate the equation using the information from step 2.
The equation can be set up as follows: SP2 - SP1 = 450. Substituting the expressions for SP2 and SP1 in terms of CP, we get 1.05*CP - 0.90*CP = 450.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for CP.
Simplifying the equation, we get 0.15*CP = 450. To find CP, we divide both sides by 0.15: CP = 450 / 0.15.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of CP.
Performing the division, CP = 3000.

The problem states that there is a square field with one side measuring 300 meters, and there is a 4-meter wide road surrounding the field on all sides. We need to find the area of this road.

## Step 2: Calculate the total area of the square field including the road
To find the area of the road, we first need to calculate the total area of the square field including the road. The side length of the larger square (field + road) is the original side length of the field plus two times the width of the road. Therefore, the side length of the larger square is 300 + 2*4 = 300 + 8 = 308 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the larger square
The area of the larger square is the square of its side length, which is 308^2 = 94864 square meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the original square field
The area of the original square field is the square of its side length, which is 300^2 = 90000 square meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the area of the road
The area of the road is the difference between the area of the larger square and the area of the original square field. Therefore, the area of the road is 94864 - 90000 = 4864 square meters.

The problem states that there are two smallest consecutive numbers whose squares' difference is a perfect square. We need to find the smaller of these two numbers.

## Step 2: Define the problem mathematically.
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as x+1. According to the problem, the difference between their squares is a perfect square. So, we have the equation: (x+1)^2 - x^2 = y^2, where y is an integer.

## Step 3: Expand and simplify the equation.
Expanding (x+1)^2 gives us x^2 + 2x + 1. So, the equation becomes: x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = y^2. Simplifying this, we get: 2x + 1 = y^2.

## Step 4: Find the smallest possible values for x and y that satisfy the equation.
We are looking for the smallest consecutive numbers, so we start with the smallest possible values. Since y^2 needs to be odd (because 2x + 1 is always odd for integer x), the smallest possible value for y is 1 (since 1^2 = 1), but this does not yield a valid solution because it would imply 2x = 0, and x cannot be 0 as it is part of a sequence of consecutive numbers. The next smallest odd perfect square is 3^2 = 9. So, we set y^2 = 9, which gives us 2x + 1 = 9.

## Step 5: Solve for x.
Solving the equation 2x + 1 = 9 for x gives us: 2x = 8, therefore x = 4.

## Step 6: Verify the solution.
Plugging x = 4 back into our original numbers, we get the numbers 4 and 5. Their squares are 16 and 25, respectively. The difference between these squares is 25 - 16 = 9, which is indeed a perfect square (3^2).

The problem states that a person saves 850 rupees every month. However, it is incomplete as it does not specify after how many months the person's savings will exceed 50,000 rupees.

## Step 2: Assume the missing part of the problem to proceed with the solution.
To proceed, let's assume the problem is asking for the month in which the person's total savings will exceed 50,000 rupees for the first time.

## Step 3: Calculate the total savings after each month to find when it exceeds 50,000 rupees.
Let's calculate the total savings after each month:
- Month 1: 850 rupees
- Month 2: 850 * 2 = 1,700 rupees
- Month 3: 850 * 3 = 2,550 rupees
We continue this pattern until the total exceeds 50,000 rupees.

## Step 4: Determine the month when the savings exceed 50,000 rupees.
We need to find the smallest n such that 850 * n > 50,000.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation to find n.
Divide both sides of the inequality by 850 to solve for n:
n > 50,000 / 850
n > 58.8235...

## Step 6: Since n must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a month in this context), round up to the next whole number.
n must be at least 59 to exceed 50,000 rupees.

The final answer is: **59**"

The problem states that we have a ribbon that is 50/3 meters long. We cut off 3/8 of this ribbon and then divide the cut portion into 5 equal parts. We are asked to find the length of one of these parts.

## Step 2: Calculate the length of the portion cut from the ribbon.
First, let's find the length of the portion that was cut off from the ribbon. The ribbon is 50/3 meters long, and 3/8 of it was cut off. So, the length of the cut portion is (3/8) * (50/3).

## Step 3: Perform the calculation for the length of the cut portion.
To find the length of the cut portion, we multiply 3/8 by 50/3. This can be calculated as (3/8) * (50/3) = (3 * 50) / (8 * 3) = 150 / 24 = 25/4 meters.

## Step 4: Divide the cut portion into 5 equal parts.
Now, we need to divide the 25/4 meters long cut portion into 5 equal parts. To do this, we divide the length of the cut portion by 5. So, the length of one part is (25/4) / 5.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation for the length of one part.
To find the length of one part, we divide 25/4 by 5. This can be calculated as (25/4) / 5 = (25/4) * (1/5) = 25 / (4 * 5) = 25 / 20 = 5/4 meters.

The problem states that there is a hostel with 20 students, and they have 150 kg of flour stored for 30 days. However, 30 kg of flour has been spoilt, and 5 students have left the hostel. We need to find out how many days the remaining flour will last for the remaining students.

## Step 2: Calculate the initial total consumption rate of flour per day for 20 students.
To find the initial consumption rate, we divide the total amount of flour by the number of days it was meant to last for 20 students. Initial consumption rate = 150 kg / 30 days = 5 kg per day for 20 students.

## Step 3: Determine the consumption rate per student per day.
To find the consumption rate per student, we divide the initial consumption rate by the number of students. Consumption rate per student = 5 kg / 20 students = 0.25 kg per student per day.

Let's denote the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago as x. Since the sum of the ages of the two trees 150 years ago was 2961 years, and the current age of the Pine tree is 1432 years, the age of the Pine tree 150 years ago would be 1432 - 150 = 1282 years. Therefore, the equation for the sum of their ages 150 years ago is x + 1282 = 2961.

## Step 3: Solve for the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago.
To find the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago, we solve the equation x + 1282 = 2961 for x. Subtracting 1282 from both sides gives x = 2961 - 1282 = 1679 years.

## Step 4: Calculate the current age of the Banyan tree.
Since we found that the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago was 1679 years, to find its current age, we add 150 years to this age: 1679 + 150 = 1829 years.

## Step 5: Find the current sum of the ages of the two trees.
Now that we know the current age of the Banyan tree is 1829 years and the current age of the Pine tree is 1432 years, we can find the sum of their current ages by adding these two numbers together: 1829 + 1432 = 3261 years.

The problem states: ""The difference between the simple interest and compound interest on a sum of 5000 taka for 3 years at an annual interest rate of 10% will be _____ taka.""

## Step 2: Calculate the simple interest for 3 years.
To calculate the simple interest, we use the formula: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) * Rate (R) * Time (T) / 100.
Here, P = 5000 taka, R = 10%, and T = 3 years.
SI = 5000 * 10 * 3 / 100 = 1500 taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the compound interest for 3 years.
To calculate the compound interest, we use the formula: Amount (A) = P * (1 + R/100)^T.
Here, P = 5000 taka, R = 10%, and T = 3 years.
A = 5000 * (1 + 10/100)^3 = 5000 * (1.1)^3 = 5000 * 1.331 = 6655 taka.
Compound Interest (CI) = A - P = 6655 - 5000 = 1655 taka.

## Step 4: Find the difference between the compound interest and simple interest.
Difference = CI - SI = 1655 - 1500 = 155 taka.

The problem states that a train travels from Kamalapur station to Narayanganj station at a speed of 30 km/h. If the speed were 25 km/h, it would take 10 minutes more to cover the distance. We need to find the distance between the two stations.

## Step 2: Define the variables and establish the relationship between speed, distance, and time.
Let's denote the distance between the two stations as \(D\) km. The time taken to cover this distance at 30 km/h is \( \frac{D}{30} \) hours, and at 25 km/h is \( \frac{D}{25} \) hours.

## Step 3: Formulate the equation based on the given information about the time difference.
The problem states that traveling at 25 km/h takes 10 minutes more than traveling at 30 km/h. We need to convert 10 minutes into hours to maintain consistency, which is \( \frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6} \) hours. The equation based on the time difference is \( \frac{D}{25} - \frac{D}{30} = \frac{1}{6} \).

## Step 4: Solve the equation for \(D\).
To solve for \(D\), we find a common denominator for \( \frac{D}{25} \) and \( \frac{D}{30} \), which is 150. Thus, the equation becomes \( \frac{6D}{150} - \frac{5D}{150} = \frac{1}{6} \). Simplifying this gives \( \frac{D}{150} = \frac{1}{6} \). Multiplying both sides by 150 yields \( D = \frac{150}{6} \).

Let's denote the cost of a notebook as N and the cost of a pencil as P.

## Step 3: Set up equations based on the given information.
From the first boy's purchase, we have the equation: 15N + 10P = 300.
From the second boy's purchase, we have the equation: 10N + 15P = 250.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can solve these equations using either substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method to find the value of P.

## Step 5: Multiply the equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of N's in both equations are the same.
Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 gives us:
30N + 20P = 600 (Equation 1)
30N + 45P = 750 (Equation 2)

## Step 6: Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate N.
Subtracting the two equations: (30N + 45P) - (30N + 20P) = 750 - 600, we get:
25P = 150

The problem states that it costs 7200 rupees to cover the floor of a room with carpet. If the room's width were 3 meters less, it would have cost 576 rupees less.

## Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the width of the room as W and the length as L. The cost of covering the floor is directly proportional to the area of the room, which is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width.

## Step 3: Formulate the cost equation
The cost of covering the floor can be represented as C = k * Area, where k is the cost per unit area. Given that the cost is 7200 rupees for the original room and 576 rupees less for a room 3 meters narrower, we can set up the equation: k * (L * W) = 7200 and k * (L * (W - 3)) = 7200 - 576.

## Step 4: Simplify the equations
From the first equation, we have k * L * W = 7200. From the second equation, we have k * L * (W - 3) = 7200 - 576, which simplifies to k * L * (W - 3) = 6624.

## Step 5: Eliminate k and L
Dividing the first equation by the second equation, we get (W) / (W - 3) = 7200 / 6624. This simplifies to (W) / (W - 3) = 100 / 92.25, which is approximately 1.083.

## Step 6: Solve for W
Cross-multiplying the equation (W) / (W - 3) = 100 / 92.25, we get 92.25W = 100W - 300. Rearranging the terms, we have 100W - 92.25W = 300, which simplifies to 7.75W = 300.

## Step 7: Calculate the width
Dividing both sides by 7.75, we get W = 300 / 7.75, which is approximately 38.71. However, we need to check if the given options or the context of the problem suggest a more precise or rounded answer.

The problem states that for a two-digit number, the sum of its digits is 10 and the difference between its digits is 4. We need to find the largest possible number that satisfies these conditions.

## Step 2: Define the digits of the two-digit number.
Let's denote the tens digit as x and the units digit as y. Therefore, the two-digit number can be expressed as 10x + y.

## Step 3: Set up equations based on the given conditions.
From the problem, we have two conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is 10: x + y = 10.
2. The difference between the digits is 4: x - y = 4.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the values of x and y.
We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.
From the second equation (x - y = 4), we can express x as x = y + 4.
Substituting x = y + 4 into the first equation (x + y = 10), we get:
(y + 4) + y = 10, which simplifies to 2y + 4 = 10.
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 2y = 6, and dividing both sides by 2 gives y = 3.
Now, substituting y = 3 back into x = y + 4, we find x = 3 + 4 = 7.

## Step 5: Determine the two-digit number using the values of x and y.
With x = 7 and y = 3, the two-digit number is 10x + y = 10*7 + 3 = 70 + 3 = 73.

## Step 6: Verify that this number satisfies the conditions of being the largest possible.
Since x = 7 and y = 3 give us the largest possible tens digit while still satisfying both conditions (sum of 10 and difference of 4), 73 is indeed the largest such number.

The problem states that a certain amount of money earns an interest of 1578 rupees in 3 years and 1830 rupees in 5 years. We are asked to find the rate of interest.

## Step 2: Determine the interest earned in 2 years
To find the rate of interest, we first need to determine the interest earned in 2 years. This can be done by subtracting the interest earned in 3 years from the interest earned in 5 years. interest_in_2_years = interest_in_5_years - interest_in_3_years = 1830 - 1578 = 252 rupees.

## Step 3: Calculate the interest earned per year
Now, we need to calculate the interest earned per year. interest_per_year = interest_in_2_years / 2 = 252 / 2 = 126 rupees.

## Step 4: Calculate the total interest earned in 3 years
We already know that the interest earned in 3 years is 1578 rupees.

## Step 5: Calculate the principal amount
Now, we can calculate the principal amount using the formula: principal = (interest_in_3_years * 100) / (rate * 3), but since we don't have the rate, we'll use the interest earned per year to find the principal. We know that interest_per_year = (principal * rate) / 100. Since interest_per_year = 126 * 3 = 378 for 3 years, and 126 * 5 = 630 for 5 years, we can set up an equation to find the principal. However, given the information, a simpler approach is to recognize that the difference in interest between 5 and 3 years is the interest earned in 2 years, which we've already calculated as 252 rupees. The interest earned each year is constant, so we can use the formula for simple interest: I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time. Since we know the interest earned in 2 years (252 rupees), we can set up a proportion to find the principal.

## Step 6: Solve for the principal amount
Let's denote the principal amount as P. The interest earned in 3 years is 1578 rupees, and in 5 years is 1830 rupees. The difference in interest between "

The problem states that a movie theater charges 7.50 for adults and 4.50 for children. The total receipt for a movie show was 540. If 80 tickets were sold, we need to find out how many adult tickets were sold.

## Step 2: Define variables for the problem
Let's define A as the number of adult tickets sold and C as the number of child tickets sold. We know that A + C = 80 (since 80 tickets were sold in total).

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the total receipt
The total receipt from adult tickets is 7.50A and from child tickets is 4.50C. The total receipt is 540, so we can set up the equation: 7.50A + 4.50C = 540.

## Step 4: Use the information from Step 2 to express C in terms of A
From A + C = 80, we can express C as C = 80 - A.

## Step 5: Substitute C from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3
Substituting C = 80 - A into the equation 7.50A + 4.50C = 540 gives us 7.50A + 4.50(80 - A) = 540.

## Step 6: Solve the equation for A
Expanding the equation gives 7.50A + 360 - 4.50A = 540. Simplifying it, we get 3A + 360 = 540. Subtracting 360 from both sides gives 3A = 180. Dividing both sides by 3 gives A = 60.

The problem states that today, my grandmother made a lot of pickle (achar) and filled 4/7 of it into glass bottles. The remaining portion was then evenly distributed among 6 of us. We need to calculate what fraction of the total pickle each person received.

## Step 2: Determine the fraction of pickle filled into bottles
The fraction of pickle filled into bottles is given as 4/7.

## Step 3: Calculate the remaining fraction of pickle
To find the remaining fraction of pickle that was distributed among the 6 people, we subtract the fraction filled into bottles from the total, which is 1. So, the remaining fraction is 1 - 4/7 = 3/7.

## Step 4: Calculate the fraction each person received
Since the remaining 3/7 of the pickle was evenly distributed among 6 people, we divide this fraction by 6 to find out what fraction each person received. Thus, each person got (3/7) / 6 = 3/7 * 1/6 = 3/42 = 1/14 of the total pickle.

The problem states that there are three brothers: Sabuz, Dalim, and Lincoln. Their father divides 6300 rupees among them. Sabuz gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, and Dalim gets twice as much as Lincoln.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the amount of money Lincoln gets as L. According to the problem, Dalim gets twice as much as Lincoln, so Dalim's amount is 2L. Since Sabuz gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, Sabuz's amount is (3/5) * 2L = 6L/5.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
The total amount of money divided among the brothers is 6300 rupees. So, the sum of the amounts received by Sabuz, Dalim, and Lincoln equals 6300. This can be written as: L + 2L + 6L/5 = 6300.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for L.
To solve for L, first find a common denominator for the fractions, which in this case is 5. Multiply every term by 5 to clear the fraction: 5L + 10L + 6L = 31500. This simplifies to 21L = 31500.

## Step 5: Find the value of L.
Divide both sides by 21 to solve for L: L = 31500 / 21 = 1500.

## Step 6: Calculate the amount Sabuz receives.
Now that we know L = 1500, we can calculate Sabuz's amount using the formula from step 2: Sabuz's amount = 6L/5 = 6 * 1500 / 5 = 1800.

The problem states that a tank holds 8000 liters of water. The tank's length is 2.56 meters, and its width is 1.25 meters. We need to find the depth of the tank.

## Step 2: Convert the volume of water from liters to cubic meters
Since 1 liter = 0.001 cubic meters, we can convert 8000 liters to cubic meters by multiplying: 8000 liters * 0.001 cubic meters/liter = 8 cubic meters.

## Step 3: Use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism to find the depth
The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length * width * height. We can rearrange this formula to solve for height (depth): depth = V / (length * width).

## Step 4: Plug in the values for volume, length, and width to find the depth
Substitute the given values into the formula: depth = 8 cubic meters / (2.56 meters * 1.25 meters).

## Step 5: Perform the calculation to find the depth
First, calculate the area of the base: 2.56 meters * 1.25 meters = 3.2 square meters. Then, divide the volume by this area: 8 cubic meters / 3.2 square meters = 2.5 meters.

The problem states that if we subtract a certain smallest number from 4639, the result will be a perfect square. We need to find that number.

## Step 2: Understand what a perfect square is.
A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares because they are the squares of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

## Step 3: Identify the closest perfect squares to 4639.
To solve this, we should first find the perfect squares closest to 4639. Since 4639 is the number from which we are subtracting, we look for perfect squares slightly less than or equal to 4639.

## Step 4: Calculate the square root of 4639 to estimate the closest perfect squares.
The square root of 4639 is approximately 68.12. This means the closest perfect squares below 4639 are 68^2 = 4624 and the one above is 69^2 = 4761.

## Step 5: Determine the closest perfect square below 4639.
From step 4, we see that 68^2 = 4624 is the closest perfect square below 4639.

## Step 6: Calculate the difference between 4639 and the closest perfect square below it.
To find the smallest number that, when subtracted from 4639, results in a perfect square, we subtract 4624 from 4639. So, 4639 - 4624 = 15.

## Step 7: Conclude the solution based on the calculations.
The number we are looking for is the difference between 4639 and the closest perfect square below it, which we calculated as 15.

The problem states that there is an empty tank with dimensions 3 meters in length, 2 meters in width, and 1 meter in height. Inside this tank, there is a solid metal cube with each side measuring 50 centimeters (or 0.5 meters). After filling the tank with water and then removing the cube, we need to find the depth of the water.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the tank.
To find the volume of the tank, we multiply its length, width, and height. Volume_tank = length * width * height = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 cubic meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cube.
The volume of a cube is found by cubing the length of its side. Volume_cube = side^3 = 0.5^3 = 0.125 cubic meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of water in the tank after the cube is removed.
When the tank is filled with water and the cube is inside, the volume of water is equal to the volume of the tank minus the volume of the cube. Volume_water = Volume_tank - Volume_cube = 6 - 0.125 = 5.875 cubic meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the depth of the water after the cube is removed.
The depth of the water can be found by dividing the volume of the water by the area of the base of the tank. The base area is length * width = 3 * 2 = 6 square meters. Depth_water = Volume_water / base_area = 5.875 / 6.

The problem states that for a two-digit number, when 7 is added to the sum of its digits, the result is three times the digit in the tens place. Additionally, when 18 is subtracted from the number, the digits swap places.

## Step 2: Represent the two-digit number algebraically
Let's represent the two-digit number as 10a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the tens place and 'b' is the digit in the ones place.

## Step 3: Formulate the equation based on the given condition
According to the problem, the sum of the digits plus 7 equals three times the digit in the tens place. This can be written as: a + b + 7 = 3a.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation from Step 3
Simplifying the equation, we get: b + 7 = 2a, which can be further simplified to b = 2a - 7.

## Step 5: Formulate the equation for the condition when 18 is subtracted
When 18 is subtracted from the original number, the digits swap places. This can be represented as: 10a + b - 18 = 10b + a.

## Step 6: Simplify the equation from Step 5
Rearranging the equation, we get: 9a - 9b = 18, which simplifies to a - b = 2.

## Step 7: Solve the system of equations
We now have two equations: b = 2a - 7 (from Step 4) and a - b = 2. We can substitute the value of b from the first equation into the second equation to solve for 'a'.

## Step 8: Substitute b in the second equation
Substituting b = 2a - 7 into a - b = 2, we get: a - (2a - 7) = 2, which simplifies to -a + 7 = 2.

## Step 9: Solve for 'a'
Solving the equation -a + 7 = 2 for 'a', we get: -a = -5, which gives a = 5.

## Step 10: Find the value of 'b'
Substituting a = 5 into the equation b = 2a - 7,"

The problem states that a certain country has a total area of approximately 32,872,630 square kilometers. Out of this, the forest area covers about 7,547,400 square kilometers, and the river basin covers 25,030,000 square kilometers. We need to find the area of the remaining part of the country, excluding the forest and river basin areas.

## Step 2: Calculate the total area covered by forests and river basins.
To find the area of the remaining part, we first need to calculate the total area covered by forests and river basins. This can be done by adding the area of the forests and the area of the river basins. total_covered_area = forest_area + river_basin_area = 7,547,400 + 25,030,000 = 32,577,400 square kilometers.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the remaining part of the country.
Now, we subtract the total covered area from the total area of the country to find the area of the remaining part. remaining_area = total_country_area - total_covered_area = 32,872,630 - 32,577,400 = 295,230! square kilometers (wait, this can't be right, there seems to be a miscalculation).

## Step 4: Recalculate the remaining area correctly.
Let's recalculate the remaining area: remaining_area = total_country_area - total_covered_area = 32,872,630 - 32,577,400 = 295,230 square kilometers.

The problem states that a gardener wants to put a rope fence around a circular garden with a radius of 21 meters, and he wants to wrap the rope around the garden twice. The cost of the rope is 18 taka per meter, and we need to find out how much money the gardener needs to buy the rope.

## Step 2: Calculate the circumference of the circular garden
To calculate the total length of rope needed, we first need to calculate the circumference of the circular garden. The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2 * π * r, where C is the circumference, π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14, and r is the radius of the circle.

## Step 3: Apply the circumference formula
Substituting the given radius (r = 21 meters) into the formula, we get C = 2 * 3.14 * 21.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation for the circumference
C = 2 * 3.14 * 21 = 131.88 meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the total length of rope needed
Since the gardener wants to wrap the rope around the garden twice, we need to multiply the circumference by 2. Total length = 2 * 131.88 = 263.76 meters.

## Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the rope
Now, we can calculate the total cost of the rope by multiplying the total length by the cost per meter. Total cost = 263.76 * 18.

## Step 7: Perform the calculation for the total cost
Total cost = 263.76 * 18 = 4747.68 taka.

The problem states that Sofikul Chacha from Atla village has brought 780 seedlings of peppers to be planted in his land. He decided that the number of seedlings in each row will be equal to the number of rows. However, when planting, he found that 4 seedlings were less than needed for this arrangement.

## Step 2: Define the problem mathematically.
Let's denote the number of rows (and also the number of seedlings in each row) as x. According to the problem, x * x = 780 - 4, because 4 seedlings were less than needed for this perfect square arrangement.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the information given.
The equation to represent the situation is x^2 = 776, since 780 - 4 = 776.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
To find x, we take the square root of both sides of the equation: x = √776.

## Step 5: Calculate the square root of 776.
Calculating the square root of 776 gives us x = √776 ≈ 27.87.

## Step 6: Consider the nature of the solution.
Since the number of rows must be an integer (you cannot have a fraction of a row in this context), and given that the square root of 776 is not a perfect integer, we need to find the closest perfect square that would make sense in the context of the problem.

## Step 7: Examine possible integer values for x.
We look for integers around 27.87, which are 27 and 28, to see if either can be a solution that fits the conditions of the problem, given that we're looking for a scenario where the number of seedlings is just 4 short of a perfect square arrangement.

## Step 8: Check if 27 or 28 could be the number of rows.
For x = 27, the total number of seedlings would be 27 * 27 = 729, which is 51 short of 780, not 4. For x = 28, the total number of seedlings would be 28 * 28 = 784, which is 4 more than 780. This means that if Sofikul Chacha had planned for 28 rows, he would have had 4 seedlings too many, not too few.

The problem states that to paint 3/5 square meters of wall, 1/3 deciliter (DL) of paint is required. We need to find out how many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deciliter (DL) of paint.

## Step 2: Understand the given information and what needs to be found.
Given: 3/5 square meters of wall requires 1/3 deciliter of paint.
To find: How many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint.

## Step 3: Set up a proportion to find the amount of wall that can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint.
First, let's figure out how much paint is needed for 1 square meter of wall. If 3/5 square meters require 1/3 deciliter, then for 1 square meter, the paint required is (1/3) / (3/5) = (1/3) * (5/3) = 5/9 deciliter.

## Step 4: Calculate how many square meters can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint.
Since 5/9 deciliter of paint is needed for 1 square meter, 1 deciliter of paint will cover 1 / (5/9) = 1 * (9/5) = 9/5 square meters.

## Step 5: Simplify the fraction to understand the final answer.
9/5 square meters can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint.

The problem statement translated into English is: ""The total salary of Farida and Fatema is 19950 Tk. Fatema earns 2450 Tk more than Farida. What is Farida's salary?""

## Step 2: Define the variables for the salaries of Farida and Fatema.
Let's denote Farida's salary as F and Fatema's salary as T.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total salary of Farida and Fatema is 19950 Tk, which can be written as F + T = 19950.
2. Fatema earns 2450 Tk more than Farida, which can be written as T = F + 2450.

## Step 4: Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for F.
Substituting T = F + 2450 into the equation F + T = 19950 gives us F + (F + 2450) = 19950.

## Step 5: Simplify and solve the equation for F.
Simplifying the equation F + F + 2450 = 19950 results in 2F + 2450 = 19950. Subtracting 2450 from both sides gives 2F = 19950 - 2450, which simplifies to 2F = 17500. Dividing both sides by 2 gives F = 17500 / 2.

## Step 6: Calculate Farida's salary.
F = 17500 / 2 = 8750.

The problem states that a small box has a length of 15 cm 2.4 mm, a width of 7 cm 6.2 mm, and a height of 5 cm 8 mm. We need to find the volume of the box in cubic centimeters.

## Step 2: Convert the given dimensions into a single unit for easier calculation.
To convert the dimensions into a single unit (centimeters), we need to convert the millimeters to centimeters. Since 1 cm = 10 mm, we can convert 2.4 mm to cm by dividing by 10, which gives 0.24 cm. Similarly, 6.2 mm is equal to 0.62 cm, and 8 mm is equal to 0.8 cm.

## Step 3: Calculate the length, width, and height of the box in centimeters.
Length = 15 cm + 0.24 cm = 15.24 cm
Width = 7 cm + 0.62 cm = 7.62 cm

The problem states that there are three brothers: Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln. Their father divided 6300 rupees among them. Sabuj received 3/5 of what Dalim received, and Dalim received twice as much as Lincoln.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the amount of money Lincoln received as L. According to the problem, Dalim received twice as much as Lincoln, so Dalim's share is 2L. Since Sabuj received 3/5 of what Dalim received, Sabuj's share is (3/5)*2L = 6L/5.

## Step 3: Formulate the equation based on the total amount of money.
The total amount of money divided among the brothers is 6300 rupees. So, the sum of their shares is L + 2L + 6L/5 = 6300.

The problem states: ""Find the smallest natural number by which 7 should be multiplied so that the product is a perfect square.""

## Step 2: Understand what makes a perfect square in relation to the given number 7.
To have a perfect square product when multiplied by 7, we need to consider the prime factors of 7 and what additional factor would make the product a perfect square. Since 7 is a prime number itself, it does not have other prime factors besides 1 and itself.

## Step 3: Determine the smallest natural number to achieve a perfect square.
For the product to be a perfect square, we need each prime factor to appear in pairs (even powers). Since 7 is a prime number, we need another 7 to make a pair, thus achieving an even power of 7, which would be 7^2 = 49, a perfect square.

## Step 4: Identify the natural number that, when multiplied by 7, gives a perfect square.
Based on the reasoning above, the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 7, results in a perfect square is 7 itself, because 7 * 7 = 49, and 49 is a perfect square.

The problem states that in a factory, 2520 cycles are produced in 7 days. However, it asks for the number of cycles that will be produced in that factory in 3 weeks.

## Step 2: Determine the number of cycles produced per day.
To find out the production rate, we divide the total cycles produced in 7 days by 7. So, cycles_per_day = 2520 / 7 = 360.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of cycles produced in 3 weeks.
Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks will have 3 * 7 = 21 days. To find the total cycles produced in 21 days, we multiply the cycles produced per day by the number of days. So, total_cycles_in_3_weeks = cycles_per_day * 21 = 360 * 21.

## Step 4: Compute the total cycles produced in 3 weeks.
Now, we calculate the total number of cycles produced in 3 weeks. total_cycles_in_3_weeks = 360 * 21 = 7560.

The problem states that in a garden, 1800 saplings are to be planted in a square pattern, but 36 more saplings are available. We need to find out how many saplings are in each row.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the total number of saplings and the number of saplings in each row.
Let's denote the number of saplings in each row as 'x'. Since the saplings are planted in a square pattern, the total number of saplings is equal to the square of the number of saplings in each row (x^2).

## Step 3: Set up an equation based on the given information.
We know that the total number of saplings is 1800, but 36 more saplings are available. This means the actual number of saplings that can be planted in a square pattern is 1800 + 36 = 1836. So, we can set up the equation x^2 = 1836.

## Step 4: Solve the equation to find the number of saplings in each row.
To find the value of 'x', we take the square root of both sides of the equation: x = √1836.

## Step 5: Calculate the square root of 1836.
x = √1836 = 42.86 (approximately), but since the number of saplings must be a whole number, we should look for the closest perfect square that is less than or equal to 1836.

## Step 6: Find the closest perfect square less than or equal to 1836.
The closest perfect square less than 1836 is 42^2 = 1764, which is less than 1836. However, we need to consider that there are 36 extra saplings, indicating that the square pattern is not perfect with 1800 saplings.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate the approach considering the square pattern and extra saplings.
Given that we have a square pattern and extra saplings, we should directly find the square root of 1800 to understand the base number of saplings per row without the extras, recognizing that the extra saplings indicate a slight deviation from a perfect square.

## Step 8: Calculate the square root of 1800 to estimate the number of saplings per row.
The square root of 1800 is approximately 42.43, suggesting that the closest whole number"

The problem states that a part of the Ichamati riverbank takes 40 workers 35 days to complete. We need to find out how many workers are required to complete the same job in 28 days.

## Step 2: Identify the inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete the job.
The problem involves an inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete the job. This means that as the number of workers increases, the time taken to complete the job decreases, and vice versa.

## Step 3: Apply the inverse proportion formula to solve the problem.
Let's denote the number of workers required to complete the job in 28 days as x. Using the inverse proportion formula, we can set up the equation: 40 * 35 = x * 28.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
To solve for x, we can start by multiplying 40 and 35, which gives us 1400. Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 28 to isolate x: x = 1400 / 28.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of x.
Performing the division, we get x = 50.

## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the gold bar.
To find the volume of the gold bar, we multiply its length, width, and height. Volume = length * width * height = 7.8 cm * 6.4 cm * 2.5 cm = 123.2 cubic centimeters (or 123.2 cm^3).

## Step 3: Understand the density relationship between gold and water.
Given that gold is 19.3 times heavier than water, and knowing that the density of water is approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm^3), we can calculate the density of gold. Density of gold = 19.3 * density of water = 19.3 g/cm^3.

## Step 4: Calculate the weight of the gold bar.
Using the volume of the gold bar from Step 2 and the density of gold from Step 3 to calculate the weight of the gold bar.
The weight of the gold bar is calculated by multiplying its volume by the density of gold.

The problem states that in a running competition, one lap of the track is equal to 800 meters. We need to find out on which lap the runner will cross the 10,000-meter mark.

## Step 2: Determine how many laps are required to reach 10,000 meters.
To find out how many laps are needed to cover 10,000 meters, we divide the total distance (10,000 meters) by the distance of one lap (800 meters).

## Step 3: Perform the calculation to find the number of laps.
Number of laps = Total distance / Distance per lap = 10,000 meters / 800 meters = 12.5 laps.

## Step 4: Interpret the result to find on which lap the 10,000-meter mark is crossed.
Since the runner cannot complete a fraction of a lap in this context, the 10,000-meter mark will be crossed during the 13th lap, as 12 full laps would only cover 9,600 meters (12 * 800), and the 13th lap would begin before reaching 10,000 meters.

The problem states that the length of a rectangular field is 25 meters more than its width, and the perimeter of the field is 150 meters. We need to find the length of the field.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the dimensions of the rectangular field.
Let's denote the width of the field as W and the length as L. According to the problem, L = W + 25.

## Step 3: Write down the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and substitute the given values.
The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W. We are told that the perimeter is 150 meters, so 150 = 2L + 2W.

## Step 4: Substitute L from Step 2 into the perimeter formula to solve for W.
Since L = W + 25, we substitute this into the perimeter formula: 150 = 2(W + 25) + 2W.

## Step 5: Simplify and solve the equation for W.
Expanding the equation gives 150 = 2W + 50 + 2W. Combining like terms yields 150 = 4W + 50. Subtracting 50 from both sides gives 100 = 4W. Dividing both sides by 4 gives W = 25.

## Step 6: Calculate the length (L) of the field using the value of W.
Now that we know W = 25, we can find L using the equation L = W + 25. Thus, L = 25 + 25 = 50.

The problem states that a businessman sells 18 kg 300 grams of rice and 5 kg 750 grams of salt on a particular day. We need to find out how much salt he sells in a month.

## Step 2: Convert the given weights into a uniform unit for easier calculation.
First, let's convert the weights into grams for uniformity. 1 kg = 1000 grams.
- Rice: 18 kg 300 grams = (18 * 1000) + 300 = 18000 + 300 = 18300 grams.
- Salt: 5 kg 750 grams = (5 * 1000) + 750 = 5000 + 750 = 5750 grams.

## Step 3: Determine the ratio or proportion of rice to salt sold.
To find the proportion of salt sold relative to rice, we calculate the ratio of salt to rice.
- Ratio = Salt / Rice = 5750 grams / 18300 grams.

## Step 4: Calculate the amount of salt sold in a day in kilograms.
To simplify calculations, let's first find out how much salt is sold in a day in kilograms.
- Salt in kg = 5750 grams / 1000 = 5.75 kg.

The problem states that a flat owner's welfare association deposited the surplus amount of 200,000 rupees collected from service charges into a bank as a fixed deposit with compound interest, compounded semi-annually. The annual interest rate is 12%. We need to find out how much interest will be accrued in the association's account after six months.

## Step 2: Convert the annual interest rate to a semi-annual rate.
Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, we need to convert the annual interest rate of 12% to a semi-annual rate. This can be calculated as 12% / 2 = 6% per semi-annual period.

## Step 3: Calculate the interest accrued after six months.
Using the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after interest, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. Since we are compounding semi-annually, n = 2. However, because we're looking for the interest after just one period of six months, the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r/n), where r/n is the interest rate per period (6% in this case). The interest accrued is then A - P.

## Step 4: Calculate the amount after six months.
Given P = 200,000 rupees and r/n = 6% or 0.06, we can calculate A = 200,000 * (1 + 0.06).

## Step 5: Perform the calculation.
A = 200,000 * (1 + 0.06) = 200,000 * 1.06 = 212,000 rupees.

## Step 6: Calculate the interest accrued.
Interest = A - P = 212,000 - 200,000 = 12,000 rupees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12000}$"

The problem states that the product of two positive perfect square numbers is 1576, and the quotient (or ratio) of the two numbers is 9/7. We need to find the smaller of the two numbers.

## Step 2: Express the problem mathematically
Let's denote the two perfect square numbers as x^2 and y^2, where x and y are positive integers. According to the problem, we have:
- The product of the two numbers: x^2 * y^2 = 1576
- The quotient of the two numbers: x^2 / y^2 = 9/7

## Step 3: Simplify the equations
From the quotient equation, we can express x^2 in terms of y^2: x^2 = (9/7) * y^2.

## Step 4: Substitute x^2 in the product equation
Substituting x^2 from the quotient equation into the product equation gives: (9/7) * y^2 * y^2 = 1576.
This simplifies to: (9/7) * y^4 = 1576.

## Step 5: Solve for y^4
Multiply both sides by 7/9 to isolate y^4: y^4 = 1576 * (7/9).

## Step 6: Calculate y^4
Perform the multiplication: y^4 = 1576 * (7/9) = 1228 * 7 / 9 * 7 = 1228 * 7 / 9 = 980 / 9 * 7 = 980 * 7 / 9 = 6860 / 9 = 764.44, approximately. However, since y^4 must be a perfect fourth power (as y is an integer and y^2 is a perfect square), we need to find the correct factorization of 1576 that fits our equations.

## Step 7: Factor 1576 correctly
1576 can be factored into prime factors to see if it helps in finding perfect squares. 1576 = 2^4 * 7^2 * 2^2 = 2^6 * 7^2 = (2^3 * 7)^2 = 56^2, but we are looking for two different perfect squares. Let's reconsider our approach focusing on the relationship given.

The problem states that there is a rectangular field with a length of 48 meters and a width of 32 meters 80 centimeters. There is a road around the field that is 3 meters wide. We need to find the area of this road.

## Step 2: Convert the width of the field into meters for uniformity.
First, we convert 32 meters 80 centimeters into meters. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 80 centimeters = 0.8 meters. So, the width of the field is 32 + 0.8 = 32.8 meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the field including the road.
To find the area of the road, we first need to find the dimensions of the field including the road. The new length will be 48 + 2*3 = 54 meters (since the road adds 3 meters on each side), and the new width will be 32.8 + 2*3 = 38.8 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the field including the road.
The area of the field including the road is the product of its length and width, which is 54 * 38.8 = 2095.2 square meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the area of the original field.
The area of the original field (without the road) is 48 * 32.8 = 1574.4 square meters.

## Step 6: Find the area of the road by subtracting the area of the original field from the area of the field including the road.
The area of the road is the difference between the area of the field including the road and the area of the original field, which is 2095.2 - 1574.4 = 520.8 square meters.

Inside this garden, there is a path that is 4 meters wide and surrounds the garden on all four sides. We need to find the cost of constructing this path at a rate of 7.25 rupees per square meter.

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the entire garden including the path
To find the area of the entire garden including the path, we first need to calculate the outer dimensions of the garden with the path. The length of the garden including the path is 80 + 2*4 = 88 meters, and the width is 60 + 2*4 = 68 meters. The area of the entire garden including the path is length * width = 88 * 68 = 5984 square meters.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the garden without the path
The area of the garden without the path is the original length * width = 80 * 60 = 4800 square meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the path
The area of the path is the difference between the area of the entire garden including the path and the area of the garden without the path. So, area of the path = area of the entire garden - area of the garden without the path = 5984 - 4800 = 1184 square meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the cost of constructing the path
The cost of constructing the path is the area of the path multiplied by the rate per square meter. Cost = area of the path * rate per square meter = 1184 * 7.25 = 8578 rupees.

The problem states that in a park, there are two trees: a banyan tree and a pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. Currently, the pine tree is 1432 years old. We need to find the sum of their ages 200 years from now.

## Step 2: Calculate the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago.
Let's denote the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago as x. Since the sum of their ages 150 years ago was 2961, and the pine tree's current age is 1432, the pine tree's age 150 years ago would be 1432 - 150 = 1282. So, we have the equation x + 1282 = 2961.

## Step 3: Solve the equation to find the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago.
Solving the equation x + 1282 = 2961, we find x = 2961 - 1282 = 1679. This means the banyan tree was 1679 years old 150 years ago.

## Step 4: Calculate the current age of the banyan tree.
To find the current age of the banyan tree, we add 150 to its age 150 years ago: 1679 + 150 = 1829.

## Step 5: Calculate the age of both trees 200 years from now.
200 years from now, the age of the banyan tree will be 1829 + 200 = 2029, and the age of the pine tree will be 1432 + 200 = 1632.

## Step 6: Find the sum of their ages 200 years from now.

The problem states that 1/6 of a stick is in the ground, 1/2 of it is in water, and the remaining part is above the water. The length of the part above the water is 2 meters.

## Step 2: Determine the fraction of the stick that is above the water.
Since 1/6 of the stick is in the ground and 1/2 of it is in water, the fraction of the stick above the water can be calculated by subtracting the sum of these fractions from 1. This gives us 1 - (1/6 + 1/2) = 1 - (1/6 + 3/6) = 1 - 4/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. This means 1/3 of the stick is above the water.

## Step 3: Calculate the total length of the stick.
Given that the part above the water is 2 meters and this represents 1/3 of the stick, we can calculate the total length of the stick. Let the total length of the stick be L. Then, 1/3 * L = 2 meters. Solving for L gives us L = 2 * 3 = 6 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the length of the stick in the ground.
Since 1/6 of the stick is in the ground and we now know the total length of the stick is 6 meters, we can find the length of the stick in the ground. This is calculated as 1/6 * 6 = 1 meter.

The problem states that the price of rice was 1080 Tk per quintal before the harvest. During the monsoon season, the price of rice increased by 15%. A farmer who sold 12 quintals of rice before the harvest wants to know how much more money he would have received if he had sold the same amount of rice during the monsoon season.

## Step 2: Calculate the original amount of money received by the farmer before the harvest.
The original price per quintal is 1080 Tk. The farmer sold 12 quintals, so the total amount received is 12 * 1080 = 12960 Tk.

## Step 3: Calculate the new price per quintal after the 15% increase during the monsoon season.
The increase in price is 15% of 1080 Tk, which is 0.15 * 1080 = 162 Tk. Therefore, the new price per quintal is 1080 + 162 = 1242 Tk.

## Step 4: Calculate the amount of money the farmer would have received if he had sold the rice during the monsoon season.
Selling 12 quintals at the new price of 1242 Tk per quintal would give the farmer 12 * 1242 = 14904 Tk.

## Step 5: Calculate the difference in the amount received between selling before the harvest and during the monsoon season.

The problem asks: What is the smallest number that when subtracted from 5834 results in a difference that is divisible by 20, 28, 32, and 35?

## Step 2: Identify the numbers by which the result should be divisible.
The numbers by which the result should be divisible are 20, 28, 32, and 35.

## Step 3: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 20, 28, 32, and 35.
To ensure divisibility by all these numbers, we need to find their Least Common Multiple (LCM). The prime factorization of each number is: 20 = 2^2 * 5, 28 = 2^2 * 7, 32 = 2^5, and 35 = 5 * 7. The LCM must include the highest powers of all primes involved: LCM = 2^5 * 5 * 7 = 1120.

## Step 4: Determine the smallest number to subtract from 5834 to make it divisible by the LCM (1120).
To find the smallest number to subtract, we divide 5834 by 1120 and look for the remainder. 5834 / 1120 = 5 with a remainder of 334. This means 5834 - 334 = 5500 is divisible by 1120.

## Step 5: Confirm the calculation.
Since 5500 is divisible by 1120 (5500 / 1120 = 4.91, which indicates an error in previous step calculation. The correct approach should directly consider the divisibility requirement without miscalculation), we need to correctly calculate the smallest number that when subtracted from 5834 makes the difference divisible by 20, 28, 32, and 35. Given the error in calculation, the correct approach involves finding the first multiple of 1120 below 5834 and subtracting that from 5834 to find the number to be subtracted.

## Step 6: Correct the miscalculation by finding the closest lower multiple of 1120 to 5834.
The closest multiple of 1120 below 5834 is 1120 * 5 = 5600.

## Step 7: Calculate the number to be subtracted.

The problem states that Abir has 10 notes of 10 taka, 10 notes of 20 taka, and 10 notes of 50 taka. We need to find the minimum number of notes Abir can use to pay 190 taka.

## Step 2: Determine the possible combinations of notes
To minimize the number of notes used, we should prioritize using the largest denomination notes first, which are the 50 taka notes.

## Step 3: Calculate the maximum amount that can be paid using 50 taka notes
Since Abir has 10 notes of 50 taka, the maximum amount he can pay using these notes is 10 * 50 = 500 taka. However, he only needs to pay 190 taka. Therefore, he can use 3 notes of 50 taka to pay 150 taka (3 * 50 = 150), leaving 40 taka remaining to be paid.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of 20 taka notes needed to pay the remaining amount
Abir has 40 taka left to pay. He can use 2 notes of 20 taka to pay 40 taka (2 * 20 = 40).

## Step 5: Determine the total number of notes used
Abir used 3 notes of 50 taka and 2 notes of 20 taka, for a total of 3 + 2 = 5 notes.

The problem states that the length of a rectangular land is three times its width, and the perimeter of the land is 40 meters. We need to find the length of the land.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the dimensions of the rectangular land.
Let's denote the width of the land as W and the length as L. According to the problem, L = 3W.

## Step 3: Write down the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.
The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W.

## Step 4: Substitute the given relation between length and width into the perimeter formula.
Given that L = 3W, we substitute this into the perimeter formula: P = 2(3W) + 2W = 6W + 2W = 8W.

## Step 5: Use the given perimeter to solve for the width.
We are told the perimeter (P) is 40 meters. So, 40 = 8W.

## Step 6: Solve for W.
Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to find W: W = 40 / 8 = 5 meters.

## Step 7: Calculate the length using the relation between length and width.
Since L = 3W, we substitute W = 5 into this equation to find L: L = 3 * 5 = 15 meters.

The problem states: ""The largest _____ number when 2300 and 3500 are divided by it, will leave remainders of 32 and 56, respectively.""

## Step 2: Understand the problem and identify what we are looking for.
We are looking for the largest number that, when 2300 is divided by it, leaves a remainder of 32, and when 3500 is divided by it, leaves a remainder of 56.

## Step 3: Formulate equations based on the division and remainder rules.
Let x be the number we are looking for. Then, according to the problem, we have:
- 2300 = qx + 32
- 3500 = rx + 56
where q and r are the quotients of the divisions.

## Step 4: Rearrange the equations to solve for x.
Rearranging the equations gives us:
- 2300 - 32 = qx
- 3500 - 56 = rx
Simplifying:
- 2268 = qx
- 3444 = rx

## Step 5: Identify the relationship between the numbers to find the largest possible x.
To find the largest x that satisfies both equations, we need to look for a common factor or use the difference between the two numbers to establish a relationship.

## Step 6: Calculate the difference between the two simplified equations.
The difference between 3444 and 2268 is 1176. This difference must be divisible by x because it represents the difference in the amounts left after removing the remainders.

The problem states that in a cricket game, the total runs scored by Imran and Sumon is 58. Imran's runs are 5 less than twice the runs scored by Sumon. We need to find out how many runs Imran scored.

## Step 2: Define variables for Imran and Sumon's runs.
Let's denote Imran's runs as I and Sumon's runs as S.

## Step 3: Set up equations based on the given information.
We have two pieces of information:
1. The total runs scored by Imran and Sumon is 58, so I + S = 58.
2. Imran's runs are 5 less than twice the runs scored by Sumon, so I = 2S - 5.

## Step 4: Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S.
Substituting I = 2S - 5 into I + S = 58 gives us 2S - 5 + S = 58.

## Step 5: Solve the equation for S.
Combining like terms, we get 3S - 5 = 58. Adding 5 to both sides gives 3S = 63. Dividing both sides by 3 gives S = 21.

## Step 6: Find Imran's runs using the value of S.
Now that we know S = 21, we can find I using the equation I = 2S - 5. Substituting S = 21 into the equation gives I = 2(21) - 5.

The problem states that in a park, there is a Banyan tree and a Pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. Currently, the Pine tree is 1432 years old. We need to find the age of the Banyan tree 200 years from now.

## Step 2: Calculate the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago.
Let's denote the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago as B and the age of the Pine tree 150 years ago as P. We know that B + P = 2961.

## Step 3: Calculate the current age of the Pine tree and its age 150 years ago.
The current age of the Pine tree is given as 1432 years. So, 150 years ago, the Pine tree's age was 1432 - 150 = 1282 years.

## Step 4: Use the information from step 2 and step 3 to find the age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago.
Since B + P = 2961 and we know that P = 1282, we can substitute the value of P into the equation to find B. So, B + 1282 = 2961, which simplifies to B = 2961 - 1282 = 1679.

## Step 5: Calculate the current age of the Banyan tree.
The age of the Banyan tree 150 years ago was 1679. To find its current age, we add 150 years to this, resulting in 1679 + 150 = 1829 years.

## Step 6: Calculate the age of the Banyan tree 200 years from now.
To find the age of the Banyan tree 200 years from now, we add 200 to its current age. So, the age 200 years from now will be 1829 + 200 = 2029 years.

The problem states: ""At what rate of interest does Rs. 6500 become Rs. 8840 in 4 years, and at the same rate, what amount will become Rs. 10200 in 4 years?""

## Step 2: Calculate the interest earned on the initial amount of Rs. 6500.
To find the rate of interest, first, we need to calculate the interest earned on the initial amount. Interest = Final amount - Initial amount = 8840 - 6500 = 2340.

## Step 3: Use the formula for simple interest to find the rate of interest.
The simple interest formula is: I = (P * R * T) / 100, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. Rearranging for R gives: R = (I * 100) / (P * T).

## Step 4: Plug in the values to the formula to find the rate of interest.
Substitute the known values into the formula: R = (2340 * 100) / (6500 * 4).

## Step 5: Perform the calculation to find the rate of interest.
Calculate the rate: R = 234000 / 26000 = 9.

## Step 6: Use the found rate of interest to calculate the new principal amount that would yield Rs. 10200 in 4 years.
Now that we know the rate of interest is 9%, we can use the formula for the amount including interest: A = P(1 + (R*T)/100), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time. Rearranging for P gives: P = A / (1 + (R*T)/100).

## Step 7: Plug in the values for the new scenario into the formula.
Substitute A = 10200, R = 9, and T = 4 into the rearranged formula: P = 10200 / (1 + (9*4)/100).

## Step 8: Perform the calculation to find the new principal amount.
Calculate the denominator first: (9*4)/100 = 36/100 = 0.36. Then, 1 + 0.36 = 1.36. Now, calculate P: P = 10200"

## Step 2: Identify the parts of the ratio and their corresponding values.
The ratio of the amounts received by Labib, Sami, and Siyam is 5:4:2. Let's assume the common multiplier for the ratio is x. This means Labib receives 5x, Sami receives 4x, and Siyam receives 2x.

## Step 3: Use the information about Siyam's amount to find the value of x.
Since Siyam received 180 taka and his part of the ratio is 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = 180 to find the value of x.

## Step 4: Solve the equation 2x = 180 for x.
Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 180 / 2 = 90.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount Labib will receive using the value of x.
Now that we know x = 90, we can find the amount Labib will receive by multiplying 5 (Labib's part of the ratio) by x: 5x = 5 * 90 = 450.

The problem statement translates to: ""The number closest to 98765 that is divisible by 28, 33, 42, and 77 is _____.""

## Step 2: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the given numbers.
To find the number that is divisible by 28, 33, 42, and 77, we first need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these numbers. The prime factorization of each number is: 28 = 2^2 * 7, 33 = 3 * 11, 42 = 2 * 3 * 7, and 77 = 7 * 11.

## Step 3: Calculate the LCM.
The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved. So, LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 7 * 11 = 4 * 3 * 7 * 11 = 924.

## Step 4: Determine the closest multiple of the LCM to 98765.
To find the number closest to 98765 that is divisible by 924, we divide 98765 by 924 to find the nearest whole number multiple. 98765 / 924 ≈ 106.86.

## Step 5: Calculate the closest multiple.
Since we're looking for the closest multiple, we consider the whole numbers just below and above 106.86, which are 106 and 107. The multiples are 106 * 924 and 107 * 924.

## Step 6: Calculate the two nearest multiples of 924 to 98765.
For 106: 106 * 924 = 97904. For 107: 107 * 924 = 98828.

## Step 7: Determine which multiple is closest to 98765.
The difference between 98765 and 97904 is 861, and the difference between 98828 and 98765 is 63. Since 63 is less than 861, 98828 is closer to 98765.

First, let's convert 20 kg 850 grams into kilograms. Since 1 kg = 1000 grams, 850 grams = 0.85 kg. So, the total amount of mustard produced on one piece of land is 20 kg + 0.85 kg = 20.85 kg.

## Step 3: Calculate the total amount of mustard produced on 7 similar pieces of land.
To find the total amount of mustard produced on 7 similar pieces of land, we need to multiply the amount produced on one piece of land by 7. total_mustard = 20.85 kg * 7.

## Step 4: Perform the multiplication to find the total amount of mustard produced.
total_mustard = 20.85 kg * 7 = 146.95 kg.

The final answer is: **146.95**"

The problem translates to: A tea trader buys a box of tea leaves at 80 rupees per kilogram. After selling all the tea leaves at 75 rupees per kilogram, he incurs a loss of 500 rupees. How many kilograms of tea leaves did he buy?

## Step 2: Define the variables and the equation for the loss.
Let's denote the number of kilograms of tea leaves bought as ""x"". The cost price of the tea leaves per kilogram is 80 rupees, so the total cost price is 80x rupees. The selling price per kilogram is 75 rupees, making the total selling price 75x rupees. The loss incurred is the difference between the total cost price and the total selling price, which is given as 500 rupees. So, the equation for the loss is 80x - 75x = 500.

## Step 3: Solve the equation for the loss to find the value of x.
Simplifying the equation 80x - 75x = 500 gives us 5x = 500. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5, resulting in x = 500 / 5 = 100.

The problem states that Raju and Roni together have 690 litchis. Roni has 86 fewer litchis than Raju. We need to find out how many litchis Raju has.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the number of litchis Raju has as R and the number of litchis Roni has as N.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
Since Roni has 86 fewer litchis than Raju, we can write the equation as N = R - 86.
We also know that together they have 690 litchis, so R + N = 690.

## Step 4: Substitute the expression for N from the first equation into the second equation to solve for R.
Substituting N = R - 86 into R + N = 690 gives us R + (R - 86) = 690.

## Step 5: Solve the equation for R.
Simplifying the equation R + R - 86 = 690, we get 2R - 86 = 690.
Adding 86 to both sides gives us 2R = 776.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us R = 388.

The problem states that there are three brothers: Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln. Their father divides 6300 rupees among them. Sabuj gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, and Dalim gets twice as much as Lincoln.

## Step 2: Define the variables for each brother's share.
Let's denote the amount of money Lincoln gets as L. According to the problem, Dalim gets twice as much as Lincoln, so Dalim's share = 2L. Sabuj gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, so Sabuj's share = (3/5) * 2L = 6L/5.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the total amount of money.
The total amount of money is 6300 rupees, which is the sum of the shares of all three brothers. So, the equation becomes: L + 2L + 6L/5 = 6300.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for L.
To solve for L, first, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which in this case is 5. Multiplying every term by 5 to clear the denominator gives us: 5L + 10L + 6L = 31500. This simplifies to 21L = 31500.

## Step 5: Calculate L.
Divide both sides of the equation by 21 to solve for L: L = 31500 / 21 = 1500.

## Step 6: Calculate Dalim's share.
Since Dalim's share is twice Lincoln's share, Dalim's share = 2L = 2 * 1500 = 3000.

The problem states that a 2-meter long bamboo stick has 75 cm of its length painted red, and the remaining length is painted white. We need to find the ratio of the total length of the bamboo stick to the length that is painted red.

## Step 2: Convert the total length of the bamboo stick into centimeters for uniformity since the length of the red portion is given in centimeters.
1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 2 meters = 200 centimeters.

## Step 3: Calculate the length of the bamboo stick that is painted white.
Total length of the bamboo stick = 200 cm, length painted red = 75 cm. Therefore, the length painted white = Total length - length painted red = 200 cm - 75 cm = 125 cm.

## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the total length of the bamboo stick to the length that is painted red.
The ratio of the total length to the red length = Total length / length painted red = 200 cm / 75 cm.

## Step 5: Simplify the ratio to its simplest form.
To simplify the ratio, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 200 and 75. The GCD of 200 and 75 is 25. Therefore, the simplified ratio = (200 / 25) / (75 / 25) = 8 / 3.

The given problem in Bengali is: ক : খ = ৪:৭, খ:গ =১০:৭ হলে, ক:খ:গ সমান _____। 
Translated into English, it reads: If K : L = 4 : 7 and L : M = 10 : 7, then K : L : M equals _____.

## Step 2: Determine the relationship between K, L, and M.
To find the relationship between K, L, and M, we first need to express L and M in terms of a common unit or factor. Given that K : L = 4 : 7 and L : M = 10 : 7, we need to make the ratios comparable.

## Step 3: Make the ratios comparable by finding a common multiple for L.
Since L is the common element in both ratios, we need to express both ratios with the same value for L. To do this, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two different values of L (7 from the first ratio and 10 from the second ratio). The LCM of 7 and 10 is 70. Now, we adjust both ratios so that L equals 70.

## Step 4: Adjust the first ratio (K : L = 4 : 7) to make L = 70.
To adjust the ratio K : L = 4 : 7 to have L = 70, we multiply both sides of the ratio by 10 (since 70 / 7 = 10). This gives us K : L = 40 : 70.

## Step 5: Adjust the second ratio (L : M = 10 : 7) to make L = 70.
To adjust the ratio L : M = 10 : 7 to have L = 70, we multiply both sides of the ratio by 7 (since 70 / 10 = 7). This gives us L : M = 70 : 49.

## Step 6: Combine the adjusted ratios to find the relationship between K, L, and M.
Now that we have K : L = 40 : 70 and L : M = 70 : 49, we can combine these to get the full relationship between K, L, and M as K : L"

The problem states that the selling price of a car is equal to 45 times the cost price of the car, and we need to find the percentage of profit or loss.

## Step 2: Determine the cost price and selling price relationship.
Let's assume the cost price (CP) of the car is $1. According to the problem, the selling price (SP) is 45 times the cost price, so SP = 45 * CP = 45 * $1 = $45.

## Step 3: Calculate the profit or loss.
To find the profit or loss, we subtract the cost price from the selling price: Profit = SP - CP = $45 - $1 = $44.

## Step 4: Calculate the percentage of profit or loss.
The percentage of profit can be calculated using the formula: (Profit / CP) * 100 = ($44 / $1) * 100 = 4400%.

## Step 5: Confirm if it's a profit or loss and adjust the percentage sign accordingly.
Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a profit. The calculated percentage represents the profit margin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4400}$"

The problem states that the profit made over a certain period of time is 5600 rupees, and this profit is 2/5 of the principal amount. Additionally, it's given that the annual interest rate is 8%.

## Step 2: Define the variables and the information given in the problem.
Let's denote the principal amount as P and the time period as T (in years). The profit (or interest) is given as 5600 rupees, and it's also stated to be 2/5 of the principal amount. Furthermore, the annual interest rate is 8%, which means the interest earned per year on the principal amount is 8% of P.

## Step 3: Express the profit as 2/5 of the principal amount and solve for the principal amount.
Given that the profit (interest) is 2/5 of the principal amount, we can write the equation as: 5600 = (2/5)P. To find P, we multiply both sides by 5/2, resulting in P = 5600 * (5/2) = 14000.

## Step 4: Use the formula for simple interest to relate the principal amount, interest rate, time, and interest earned.
The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest earned, P is the principal amount, R is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and T is the time period in years. Given I = 5600, P = 14000 (from step 3), and R = 8% or 0.08, we can rearrange the formula to solve for T: T = I / (P * R).

## Step 5: Calculate the time period using the values obtained.
Plugging the values into the rearranged formula gives T = 5600 / (14000 * 0.08) = 5600 / 1120 = 5.
