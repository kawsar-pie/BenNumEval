638,"কোনো প্রকৃত ভগ্নাংশের লব ও হরের যোগফল ১৪ এবং বিয়োগফল ৮ হলে, ভগ্নাংশটি নির্ণয় কর।",৩/১১,"To solve this problem, we first need to translate it into English for clarity:

""Given that the sum of the numerator and denominator of a fraction is 14 and the difference is 8, find the fraction.""

Let's denote the numerator as \(N\) and the denominator as \(D\). According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. \(N + D = 14\)
2. \(N - D = 8\)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \(N\) and \(D\).

From equation 2, we have \(N = D + 8\).

Substituting \(N\) from this equation into equation 1, we get:
\[D + 8 + D = 14\]
\[2D + 8 = 14\]
\[2D = 14 - 8\]
\[2D = 6\]
\[D = 3\]

Now, substituting \(D = 3\) into the equation \(N = D + 8\), we get:
\[N = 3 + 8\]
\[N = 11\]

Therefore, the fraction is \(\frac{N}{D} = \frac{11}{3}\).

Given:
- 1071 dhuti (a type of traditional Bengali garment, but for simplicity, let's consider it as a type of clothing item)
- 595 shaari (sari, another traditional garment)
- 357 jama (shirts)

First, let's translate the problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states there are 1071 pieces of dhuti, 595 pieces of shaari, and 357 shirts in stock. These items are to be evenly distributed among some families. We need to find out how many shirts each family will get.""

Now, to solve this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1071, 595, and 357 since the distribution has to be even across all types of garments for each family.

Calculating the GCD:
- Factors of 1071: 1, 3, 7, 9, 17, 21, 51, 63, 119, 153, 357, 1071
- Factors of 595: 1, 5, 7, 17, 35, 85, 119, 595
- Factors of 357: 1, 3, 7, 17, 21, 51, 119, 357

The greatest common factor among these numbers is 17 (as it's the largest number that appears in all three lists of factors), meaning each type of garment can be divided into groups of 17.

Now, to find out how many shirts each family will get:
Total shirts = 357
GCD (or number of groups) = 17

Shirts per family = Total shirts / Number of groups = 357 / 17 = 21

Therefore, each family will get 21 shirts.

The problem asks us to convert 9 crores, 99 lakhs, 33 thousands, 440 Takas into Euros.

First, let's convert the given amount into a single unit, i.e., Takas. The given amount in words translates to:
9,00,00,000 + 99,00,000 + 33,000 + 440 = 9,99,33,440 Takas.

Now, to find out how many Euros this equals, we use the exchange rate:
1 Euro = 120 Takas.

So, the number of Euros = Total Takas / 120.

Number of Euros = 9,99,33,440 / 120.

Now, calculating this gives:
9,99,33,440 / 120 = 83,277.867

Since the amount needs to be in Euros and the calculation results in a decimal, it's reasonable to keep the answer as precise as possible, but rounding may be necessary depending on the context. However, for the sake of providing a final numerical answer, we will keep it precise to the calculation result without rounding.

Translation: A part of the bank of the Ichamati River takes 40 workers 35 days to embank. How many workers will it take to complete the embanking of that part in 28 days?

Now, let's solve the problem using the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time taken to complete the work. If 40 workers can complete the work in 35 days, then the total work done is 40 workers * 35 days = 1400 worker-days.

To complete the same work in 28 days, we need to find out how many workers are required. Let's denote the number of workers needed as 'x'. The equation becomes: x workers * 28 days = 1400 worker-days.

Solving for 'x', we get: x = 1400 worker-days / 28 days = 50 workers.

Therefore, to complete the embanking in 28 days, 50 workers will be needed.

The problem states that we have three positive numbers. The product of the first and second numbers is 24, the product of the second and third numbers is 48, and the product of the first and third numbers is 32. We need to find the largest of these three numbers.

## Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the first number as x, the second number as y, and the third number as z.

## Step 3: Write the equations based on the given information
From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. xy = 24
2. yz = 48
3. xz = 32

## Step 4: Solve the equations to find the values of x, y, and z
We can start by solving these equations to find the values of x, y, and z.

## Step 5: Manipulate the equations to simplify
Dividing equation (1) by equation (3) gives y/z = 24/32 = 3/4.
Dividing equation (2) by equation (3) gives y/x = 48/32 = 3/2.

## Step 6: Express y in terms of x and z
From the previous step, we have y = (3/2)x and y = (3/4)z.

## Step 7: Equate the expressions for y to find the relationship between x and z
Equating the two expressions for y gives (3/2)x = (3/4)z.
This simplifies to 2x = z, or z = 2x.

## Step 8: Substitute z = 2x into one of the original equations to solve for x
Substituting z = 2x into equation (3) gives x(2x) = 32, which simplifies to 2x^2 = 32.

## Step 9: Solve for x
Solving 2x^2 = 32 gives x^2 = 16, and therefore x = 4 (since x is positive).

## Step 10: Find the values of y and z
Substituting x = 4 into equation (1) gives 4y = 24, which simplifies to y = 6.
Substituting x = 4 into z = 2x gives z = 8.

## Step 11: Determine the largest number

""The area of a triangular land is 264 square meters. If its base is 22 meters, then determine its height.""

Now, we can proceed with the solution. The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is given by:

Area = (base × height) / 2

Given the area (A) as 264 square meters and the base (b) as 22 meters, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the height (h):

264 = (22 × h) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

528 = 22 × h

Now, divide both sides by 22 to isolate h:

h = 528 / 22
h = 24

Therefore, the height of the triangle is 24 meters.

The translation of the problem is: ""What is the smallest number that should be added to 5320 to make the sum a perfect square?""

Now, let's proceed with finding the solution. 

We start by finding the square root of 5320. The square root of 5320 is approximately 73.02. This means the closest perfect square below 5320 is 73^2 = 5329.

However, we are looking for the smallest number to add to 5320 to make it a perfect square. Since 73^2 is 5329, which is greater than 5320, we actually need to find the next perfect square after 5320.

The next perfect square after 73^2 (5329) would be 74^2 = 5476. 

To make 5320 a perfect square, we need to add enough to reach 5476, which is the next perfect square.

So, the calculation would be: 5476 (the next perfect square) - 5320 (the given number) = 156.

Thus, the smallest number that should be added to 5320 to make the sum a perfect square is 156.

Abdullah draws a line that is 1 meter long. Then, he realizes it's a bit long. So, he erases 33 centimeters of it. As a result, the length of the line is now how many centimeters?

2. Solution:
First, we need to convert the initial length of the line from meters to centimeters, since the erased portion is given in centimeters and we want the final length in centimeters. 
1 meter = 100 centimeters.

The initial length of the line is 1 meter, which is equal to 100 centimeters.

Abdullah erases 33 centimeters from this line. 

To find the new length of the line, we subtract the erased portion from the initial length:
New length = Initial length - Erased portion
New length = 100 cm - 33 cm
New length = 67 cm

Therefore, the length of the line now is 67 centimeters.

There is a rectangular garden with a length of 80 meters and a width of 60 meters. Inside this garden, there is a 4-meter wide path surrounding it on all four sides. The cost of constructing this path is 7.25 Tk per square meter. We need to find the total cost of constructing this path.

Now, let's calculate the area of the path. To do this, we first find the area of the larger rectangle (including the path) and then subtract the area of the garden.

The length of the larger rectangle = length of the garden + 2 * width of the path
= 80m + 2 * 4m
= 80m + 8m
= 88m

The width of the larger rectangle = width of the garden + 2 * width of the path
= 60m + 2 * 4m
= 60m + 8m
= 68m

The area of the larger rectangle = length * width
= 88m * 68m
= 5984 sq m

The area of the garden = length * width
= 80m * 60m
= 4800 sq m

The area of the path = area of the larger rectangle - area of the garden
= 5984 sq m - 4800 sq m
= 1184 sq m

Now, we can find the total cost of constructing the path:
Total cost = area of the path * cost per square meter
= 1184 sq m * 7.25 Tk/sq m

So, the total number of sausages is x * x = x^2.
The total number of biscuits is x * 2x = 2x^2.

The total number of sausages and biscuits is given as 147. Therefore, we can write the equation:
x^2 + 2x^2 = 147

The second boy bought 10 notebooks and 15 pencils for 250 taka, so we can write the equation:
10N + 15P = 250 ... (Equation 2)

Now, we need to solve these equations to find the value of P.

First, let's multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 2 to facilitate the elimination of one variable:
45N + 30P = 900 ... (Equation 3, multiplied Equation 1 by 3)
20N + 30P = 500 ... (Equation 4, multiplied Equation 2 by 2)

Now, subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3 to eliminate P:
(45N - 20N) + (30P - 30P) = 900 - 500
25N = 400

Now, solve for N:
N = 400 / 25
N = 16

Now that we have the price of one notebook (N = 16), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for P. Let's use Equation 1:
15N + 10P = 300
15(16) + 10P = 300
240 + 10P = 300

Subtract 240 from both sides:

""Translation: The selling price of a car is equal to 45 parts of the cost price of the car. Determine the percentage profit or loss.""

Let's denote the cost price of the car as CP and the selling price as SP. According to the problem, the selling price is 45 parts of the cost price, but for clarity, we'll interpret this as the selling price being 45% of the cost price, or 0.45 times the cost price.

Given:
- SP = 0.45 * CP

To find the percentage profit or loss, we compare the selling price to the cost price. The formula for percentage profit is ((SP - CP) / CP) * 100, and for percentage loss is ((CP - SP) / CP) * 100.

Since SP = 0.45 * CP, it's clear that SP < CP, indicating a loss.

Calculating the loss percentage:
- Loss = CP - SP = CP - 0.45 * CP = 0.55 * CP
- Loss percentage = (Loss / CP) * 100 = (0.55 * CP / CP) * 100 = 55%

Therefore, the car is sold at a 55% loss.

Now, let's solve the problem. The total amount of juice is 4/5 liters, and it is to be divided equally among 2 people. To find out how much each person will get, we divide the total amount of juice by the number of people:

(4/5) liters / 2 people = (4/5) / 2 liters per person

To simplify this, we can multiply the fraction by 1/2 (since dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by 1/2):

(4/5) * (1/2) = 4/10 = 2/5 liters per person

Therefore, each person will get 2/5 liters of juice.

Translation: In a cricket game, the total number of runs scored by Imran and Sumon is 58. The number of runs scored by Imran is 5 less than twice the number of runs scored by Sumon. How many runs did Imran score in that game?

Let's denote the number of runs scored by Sumon as S and the number of runs scored by Imran as I. According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. I + S = 58 (The total number of runs scored by both is 58)
2. I = 2S - 5 (Imran's runs are 5 less than twice Sumon's runs)

We can substitute the expression for I from the second equation into the first equation:

(2S - 5) + S = 58

Combine like terms:

3S - 5 = 58

Add 5 to both sides:

3S = 63

Divide by 3:

S = 21

Now that we know Sumon scored 21 runs, we can find Imran's score using the second equation:

I = 2S - 5
I = 2*21 - 5
I = 42 - 5
I = 37

Therefore, Imran scored 37 runs.

Now, let's solve the problem:

The field has a length of 40 meters and a width of 30 meters. There are two roads crossing in the middle, each 1.5 meters wide. To find the total area of the roads, we can calculate the area of the two roads separately and then add them together.

The first road is 40 meters long and 1.5 meters wide, so its area is:
40 * 1.5 = 60 square meters

The second road is 30 meters long and 1.5 meters wide, so its area is:
30 * 1.5 = 45 square meters

However, the two roads intersect, creating a square that is counted twice. The side length of this square is 1.5 meters, so its area is:
1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25 square meters

To find the total area of the roads, we add the areas of the two roads and subtract the area of the intersection:

Translation of the problem: 
A job can be done by A and B together in 16 days, by B and C together in 12 days, and by A and C together in 20 days. How many days will it take for A, B, and C to do the job together?

Let's denote the rate of work of A, B, and C as a, b, and c, respectively, in terms of how much of the job they can complete per day.

From the given information:
1. A and B together can complete the job in 16 days, so their combined rate of work per day is \( \frac{1}{16} \). Thus, \( a + b = \frac{1}{16} \).
2. B and C together can complete the job in 12 days, so their combined rate of work per day is \( \frac{1}{12} \). Thus, \( b + c = \frac{1}{12} \).
3. A and C together can complete the job in 20 days, so their combined rate of work per day is \( \frac{1}{20} \). Thus, \( a + c = \frac{1}{20} \).

Adding these three equations gives us:
\[ 2(a + b + c) = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{20} \]

Combining the fractions on the right side with a common denominator (240):
\[ 2(a + b + c) = \frac{15 + 20 + 12}{240} \]
\[ 2(a + b + c) = \frac{47}{240} \]

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ a + b + c = \frac{47}{480} \]

This represents the combined rate of work for A, B, and C per day. To find out how many days they need to complete the job together, we take the reciprocal:
\[ \text{Days to complete} = \frac{1}{a + b + c} = \frac{480}{47} \]

Therefore, A, B, and C together can complete the job in approximately 10.21 days.

1. Translation of the problem:
""The annual interest rate is 10.50%. What will be the interest on 2000 taka for 5 years?""

2. Solution:
To calculate the interest, we use the formula for simple interest, which is:
\[ \text!{Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount of money),
- \( R \) is the annual interest rate (in %),
- \( T \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for (in years).

Given that:
- \( P = 2000 \) taka,
- \( R = 10.50\% \),
- \( T = 5 \) years,

we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text!{Interest} = \frac{2000 \times 10.50 \times 5}{100} \]
\[ \text!{Interest} = \frac{2000 \times 52.5}{100} \]
\[ \text!{Interest} = \frac{105000}{100} \]
\[ \text!{Interest} = 1050 \]

Therefore, the interest on 2000 taka for 5 years at an annual interest rate of 10.50% is 1050 taka.

Now, let's solve the problem. For both wheels to complete an integer number of full rotations at the same time, the total distance traveled must be a multiple of both wheel circumferences. 

To find the minimum distance, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the two circumferences. 

The LCM of 14 and 35 can be calculated as follows:
- First, find the prime factors of each number. 14 = 2 * 7 and 35 = 5 * 7.
- Then, take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. So, we have 2^1 (from 14), 5^1 (from 35), and 7^1 (common to both).
- The LCM is the product of these highest powers: LCM = 2 * 5 * 7 = 70.

Therefore, the minimum distance the train must travel for both wheels to complete an integer number of full rotations at the same time is 70 decimeters (since 70 is the smallest number that both 14 and 35 can divide into evenly).

""The smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35 needs to be calculated.""

To solve this, we find the LCM of 12, 15, 20, and 35. 
The prime factorization of the given numbers is as follows:
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 20 = 2^2 * 5
- 35 = 5 * 7

""A movie theater charges 7.50 dollars for adults and 4.50 dollars for children. The total receipt for a movie show was 540 dollars. If 80 tickets were sold, find out how many adult tickets were sold.""

Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as A and the number of child tickets sold as C. We know the following:

1. The total number of tickets sold was 80, so A + C = 80.
2. The total amount of money earned from adult tickets is 7.50A and from child tickets is 4.50C.
3. The total receipt was 540 dollars, so 7.50A + 4.50C = 540.

We can solve these equations to find the value of A. First, let's express C in terms of A from the first equation:

C = 80 - A

Now, substitute this expression for C into the third equation:

7.50A + 4.50(80 - A) = 540

Expand the equation:

7.50A + 360 - 4.50A = 540

Combine like terms:

3A + 360 = 540

Subtract 360 from both sides:

3A = 180

Divide by 3:

A = 60

Therefore, the number of adult tickets sold was 60.

""A box of grapes is sold for 2750 rupees, resulting in a loss of 450 rupees. If the grapes were sold for 3600 rupees, what would be the profit or loss?""

Now, let's calculate the cost price of the grapes. Since selling at 2750 rupees results in a loss of 450 rupees, the cost price can be calculated as follows:
Cost Price = Selling Price + Loss
Cost Price = 2750 + 450
Cost Price = 3200 rupees

If the grapes were sold for 3600 rupees, the profit can be calculated as:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 3600 - 3200
Profit = 400 rupees

Therefore, selling the grapes at 3600 rupees would result in a profit of 400 rupees.

The problem states that a person has 5000 units of money, which is divided between two individuals in such a way that the first person's money is four times that of the second person. Additionally, if 1500 units of money are transferred from the first person to the second, both individuals will have an equal amount of money. We need to determine the amount of money the second person initially has.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the amount of money the first person has as ""x"" and the amount the second person has as ""y"". We are given two conditions:
1. x = 4y (the first person's money is four times that of the second person)
2. x + y = 5000 (the total amount of money is 5000 units)
3. After transferring 1500 units from the first person to the second, the amounts are equal: (x - 1500) = (y + 1500)

## Step 3: Solve the system of equations.
First, we'll express x in terms of y from the first condition: x = 4y.
Then, we'll substitute x in the second condition: 4y + y = 5000, which simplifies to 5y = 5000.
Solving for y gives us y = 5000 / 5 = 1000.

## Step 4: Validate the solution using the third condition.
Substitute x and y into the third condition to ensure the equality holds after the transfer: (4y - 1500) = (y + 1500).
Substituting y = 1000: (4*1000 - 1500) = (1000 + 1500) => 2500 = 2500, which confirms our solution is correct.

Now, let's denote the current age of the banyan tree as B and the current age of the pine tree as P. We are given that P = 1432 years.

150 years ago, the age of the banyan tree was B - 150, and the age of the pine tree was P - 150. We are given that the sum of their ages 150 years ago was 2961 years. So, we can write the equation:

(B - 150) + (P - 150) = 2961

Substituting P = 1432 into the equation, we get:

(B - 150) + (1432 - 150) = 2961
(B - 150) + 1282 = 2961

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B - 150 = 2961 - 1282
B - 150 = 1679

Adding 150 to both sides of the equation, we get:

B = 1679 + 150
B = 1829

Translation: A rectangular park is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. How much will it cost to fence around the park at a rate of 100 taka per meter?

Now, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park since the fence will go around its perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + width).

Given length (l) = 100 meters and width (w) = 50 meters, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(100 + 50)
P = 2(150)
P = 300 meters

Since the cost is 100 taka per meter, the total cost to fence around the park will be the perimeter multiplied by the cost per meter:

Total Cost = Perimeter * Cost per meter
Total Cost = 300 * 100
Total Cost = 30,000 taka

The translation of the problem is: ""What is the smallest number that can be subtracted from 5605 so that the difference is a perfect square?""

Now, to solve this problem, we need to find the closest perfect square to 5605. We start by finding the square root of 5605, which is approximately 74.83. The closest perfect squares to 5605 are 74^2 = 5476 and 75^2 = 5625.

Since we need to subtract a number from 5605 to get a perfect square, we consider the perfect square that is closest to but not greater than 5605, which is 74^2 = 5476. 

However, to find the smallest number to subtract, we should look at the difference between 5605 and the next lower perfect square (74^2) and the difference between 5605 and the next higher perfect square (75^2), and then choose the smaller difference.

The difference between 5605 and 74^2 (5476) is 5605 - 5476 = 129.
The difference between 75^2 (5625) and 5605 is 5625 - 5605 = 20.

Since 20 is smaller than 129, the smallest number that can be subtracted from 5605 to make the difference a perfect square is 20.

Now, let's solve the problem. To find the smallest natural number by which 432 should be multiplied to get a perfect square, we need to analyze the prime factorization of 432.

432 = 2^4 * 3^3

For 432 to be a perfect square when multiplied by another number, all prime factors must have even exponents. Currently, 2 has an even exponent (4), but 3 has an odd exponent (3). To make the exponent of 3 even, we need to multiply 432 by 3.

So, the smallest natural number by which 432 should be multiplied to get a perfect square is 3.

1. Translation of the problem:
""The problem states that 15 ballpens are bought for 75 taka and sold for 90 taka. We need to find the percentage of profit.""

2. Solution:
- Cost Price (CP) for 15 ballpens = 75 taka
- Selling Price (SP) for 15 ballpens = 90 taka

To calculate profit percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{SP} - \text{CP}}{\text{CP}} \right) \times 100 \]

However, since the question involves buying and selling the same quantity of items (15 ballpens), we can calculate the cost and selling price per item to simplify the calculation:
- Cost Price per ballpen = \( \frac{75}{15} \) = 5 taka
- Selling Price per ballpen = \( \frac{90}{15} \) = 6 taka

Now, using the simplified values:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 - 5}{5} \right) \times 100 \]

Let the initial capital be x rupees.

The annual profit at 8% interest is 0.08x rupees.
The annual profit at 10% interest is 0.10x rupees.

The difference in annual profit is 0.10x - 0.08x = 0.02x rupees.

""A rectangular room has a perimeter equal to that of a square room. The length of the rectangular room is three times its width. At a rate of 75 taka per square meter, it costs 11,025 taka to carpet the floor of the room. How many 40 square centimeter tiles will be needed to cover the floor of the square room?""

Now, let's break down the problem step by step.

Given that the length of the rectangular room is three times its width, we can denote the width as W and the length as 3W.

The perimeter of the rectangular room is 2(length + width) = 2(3W + W) = 8W.

Since the perimeter of the rectangular room is equal to that of the square room, we can denote the side length of the square room as S. The perimeter of the square room is 4S.

Equating the two perimeters, we get:
8W = 4S
S = 2W

Now, let's calculate the area of the rectangular room. The area is length times width, which is 3W * W = 3W^2.

We are given that the cost of carpeting the floor is 11,025 taka at a rate of 75 taka per square meter. To find the area, we divide the cost by the rate:
Area = Cost / Rate = 11,025 / 75 = 147 square meters

Since 1 square meter = 10,000 square centimeters, the area in square centimeters is:
147 * 10,000 = 1,470,000 square centimeters

Now, we can equate this area to 3W^2:
3W^2 = 1,470,000
W^2 = 490,000
W = sqrt(490,000) = 700 (since we're dealing with lengths, we take the positive square root)

Now that we have the width of the rectangular room, we can find the side length of the square room:
S = 2W = 2 * 700 = 1400

The area of the square room is S^2 = 1400^2 = 1,960,000 square centimeters.

""3/5 square meters of wall is painted with 1/3 deci liter of paint. How many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deci liter of paint?""

Now, we can proceed with the solution. 

We know that 3/5 square meters of wall requires 1/3 deci liter of paint. To find out how many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deci liter of paint, we need to set up a proportion.

Let x be the number of square meters of wall that can be painted with 1 deci liter of paint. 

We have the proportion: (3/5) / (1/3) = x / 1

Simplifying the proportion, we get: (3/5) * (3/1) = x

This simplifies to: (9/5) = x

So, 9/5 square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deci liter of paint.

To convert the fraction into a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 9 ÷ 5 = 1.8

Therefore, 1 deci liter of paint can paint 1.8 * 10 = 18 square decameters or 1.8 square meters is equivalent to 18 square decameters and 1 decameter is 10 times bigger than 1 meter, 1 deci liter can paint 1.8 square meters of wall, or more precisely in this problem 1 deci liter can paint 1.8 square meters = 18/10 square meters of wall.

Translation: In a garden, 1800 saplings are to be planted in a square pattern, but 36 more saplings are available. Determine the number of saplings in each row.

Let's denote the number of saplings in each row as 'x'. Since the saplings are planted in a square pattern, the total number of saplings used would be x^2. However, we have 36 more saplings than needed for a perfect square, meaning the total number of saplings we have is x^2 + 36 = 1800.

To find 'x', we set up the equation as follows:
x^2 + 36 = 1800

Subtract 36 from both sides:
x^2 = 1764

Now, find the square root of both sides:
x = √1764

Translation: 
There are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 shirts in stock. These items are to be divided equally among some families. How many dhotis will each family get?

To find out how many dhotis each family will get, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1071, 595, and 357, since the items are to be divided equally among the families. However, the problem seems to be asking for the number of dhotis each family will get, assuming the division is done in a way that each family gets an equal number of items, and the question does not explicitly require us to find the GCD of all items.

Given the information and the goal to divide these items equally among families, it seems we are looking for the highest equal division possible for dhotis without necessarily linking it directly to the GCD of all items. 

Since we are only asked about the dhotis, let's find the factors of 1071 to see how it can be divided equally:
1071 = 3 * 7 * 3 * 17

The question implies that we are looking for a division where each family gets the same number of dhotis, but without specifying the families' number directly, we cannot calculate the exact number of dhotis per family based on the provided information alone. 

However, if we consider the context might imply that the division should be such that all items (dhotis, saris, and shirts) are divided into equal groups, we would then look for common factors. Yet, the problem statement lacks clarity on whether we are dividing each type of item separately or looking for a common divisor for all items to divide them into groups of families.

Assuming we need to divide the dhotis equally among families without a specified number of families but ensuring the division is as equal as possible, we lack a direct way to calculate this without more information on how the division should be approached (e.g., the total number of families or a common divisor for all items).

But, considering a straightforward interpretation where we might be looking for how many groups of dhotis can be made, we'd look at factors of 1071. For simplicity, if we were to divide the dhotis into equal groups without changing the quantity of each group, we'd consider how many times 1071 can be divided"

1. R + N = 690 (Together they have 690 litchis)
2. N = R - 86 (Ronnie has 86 litchis less than Raju)

Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
R + (R - 86) = 690

""Translation: A number is 9 less than double the other, and their sum is 42. What is the larger number?""

Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y.

We can write two equations based on the given information:

1. y = 2x - 9 (since one number is 9 less than double the other)
2. x + y = 42 (since the sum of the two numbers is 42)

Substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation:

x + (2x - 9) = 42

Combine like terms:

3x - 9 = 42

Add 9 to both sides:

3x = 51

Divide by 3:

x = 17

Now that we have the value of x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the original equations:

y = 2x - 9
y = 2(17) - 9
y = 34 - 9
y = 25

The volume of the tank is given as 8000 liters, and we need to convert this into cubic meters because the measurements are in meters. 

1 cubic meter = 1000 liters
So, 8000 liters = 8000 / 1000 = 8 cubic meters

The formula for volume (V) is V = length × width × height. We are given:
- Volume (V) = 8 cubic meters
- Length (l) = 2.56 meters
- Width (w) = 1.25 meters
We need to find the height (h).

Given V = l × w × h, we can rearrange the formula to find h: 
h = V / (l × w)

Plugging in the values:
h = 8 / (2.56 × 1.25)

First, calculate the denominator:

""An fruit seller has 1/2 of the total fruits as apples, 1/3 of the total fruits as oranges, and 40 mangoes. How many fruits does he have in total?""

Let's denote the total number of fruits as ""x"".

Since 1/2 of the total fruits are apples, the number of apples is (1/2)x.

Since 1/3 of the total fruits are oranges, the number of oranges is (1/3)x.

The number of mangoes is given as 40.

We know that the total number of fruits is the sum of the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

(1/2)x + (1/3)x + 40 = x

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

(3/6)x + (2/6)x + 40 = x

Combine like terms:

(5/6)x + 40 = x

Subtract (5/6)x from both sides:

40 = x - (5/6)x

40 = (1/6)x

Multiply both sides by 6:

Let's denote the amount taken at 6% interest as 'x' and the amount taken at 4% interest as 'y'. We know that the total amount is 56,000 taka, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 56,000

We also know that the total interest paid is 2,840 taka. The interest from the first loan is 6% of 'x', and the interest from the second loan is 4% of 'y'. So, we can write the equation:

0.06x + 0.04y = 2840

Now, we need to find the annual interest if 5% interest is applicable on the entire loan.

First, let's solve the system of equations. We can multiply! the first equation by 0.04 and subtract it from the second equation to eliminate 'y':

0.06x + 0.04y = 2840
0.04x + 0.04y = 0.04 * 56,000
0.06x + 0.04y - (0.04x + 0.04y) = 2840 - 0.04 * 56,000
0.02x = 2840 - 2240
0.02x = 600
x = 600 / 0.02
x = 30,000

Now, substitute the value of 'x' into the first equation to find 'y':

30,000 + y = 56,000
y = 56,000 - 30,000
y = 26,000

The smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60 is 60 itself is not a perfect square, but 60 * 60 = 3600 is, and also 60 * 4 = 240 and 60 * 9 = 540 and 60 * 16 = 960 are not perfect squares but 60 * 15 = 900 is not but 60 * 12 = 720 is not, however, 60 * 3 = 180 is not, but 60 * 5 = 300 is not, however 60 * 4 = 240 is not, but 60 * 25 = 1500 is not but 60 * 36 = 2160 is not but 60 * 9 = 540 is not, however, the least one is 60 * 60 = 3600.

However, since 60 itself is not a perfect square, we consider the next multiples of 60 for a perfect square. In real scenarios like this, where an exact square might be difficult to find due to the LCM not being a square, the context usually implies finding the smallest number that satisfies all given conditions (LCM for the rows).

""The length of a rectangular room is one and a half times its width. If its area is 216 square meters, what is its perimeter?""

Let's denote the width of the room as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is one and a half times the width, so we can express the length in terms of the width as L = 1.5W.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula Area = Length × Width. We are told the area is 216 square meters, so we can write the equation as 216 = L × W.

Substituting L = 1.5W into the area equation gives us 216 = 1.5W × W, which simplifies to 216 = 1.5W^2.

To solve for W, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5, resulting in 144 = W^2.

Taking the square root of both sides gives us W = 12. Since the width cannot be negative, W = 12 meters.

Now that we have the width, we can find the length: L = 1.5W = 1.5 × 12 = 18 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width). Substituting the values we found gives us Perimeter = 2 × (18 + 12) = 2 × 30 = 60 meters.

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 60 meters.

Translation: 
Yadunath Vidya Mandir school's sixth-grade students were sent saplings from the panchayat to be planted in the school garden. It was calculated that when the saplings are planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30, there are an equal number of saplings in each row. We need to calculate the minimum number of saplings sent by the panchayat.

To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 24, and 30 since the number of saplings must be divisible by each of these numbers to allow for equal distribution in rows of 20, 24, or 30.

The prime factorization of these numbers is as follows:
- 20 = 2^2 * 5
- 24 = 2^3 * 3
- 30 = 2 * 3 * 5

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2! is 2^3 (from 24)
- The highest power of 3! is 3 (from 24 and 30)
- The highest power of 5! is 5 (from 20 and 30)

Thus, the LCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120.

This means the minimum number of saplings that allows for equal distribution in rows of 20, 24, or 30 is 120.

Now, let's calculate the area of the remaining part:

Total area of the country = 32,872,263 square kilometers
Area of the forest = 7,547,740 square kilometers
Area of the river basin = 25,030,000 square kilometers

Total area covered by forest! = 7,547,740 + 25,030,000 = 32,577,740 square kilometers 

However, to correctly account for the overlap or distinct areas covered by both the forest and the river basin, we should directly calculate the remaining area after subtracting the total area covered by both from the country's total area. But since the problem statement directly suggests subtraction without specifying overlaps, we will proceed with a straightforward calculation for the sake of providing an answer based on given data.

Area of the remaining part = Total area of the country - (Area of the forest + Area of the river basin)
= 32,872,263 - 32,577,740

""The sum of the ages of the mother and the son is 60 years. The mother's age is three times the son's age. What is the mother's age?""

Let's denote the son's age as ""S"" and the mother's age as ""M"". According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. M + S = 60 (The sum of their ages is 60)
2. M = 3S (The mother's age is three times the son's age)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for S:

3S + S = 60
4S = 60
S = 60 / 4
S = 15

Now that we know the son's age, we can find the mother's age by substituting S back into one of the original equations:

M = 3S
M = 3 * 15
M = 45

Therefore, the mother's age is 45 years.

Now, let's denote the total length of the stick as ""L"" meters. According to the problem, 1/2 of the stick is in the ground, 1/3 is in the water, and the remaining part, which is above the water, is 3 meters.

The part above the water can be represented as L - (1/2)L - (1/3)L, because we subtract the parts that are in the ground and in the water from the total length.

So, we have:
L - (1/2)L - (1/3)L = 3

To simplify, find a common denominator for 1/2 and 1/3, which is 6. Thus, the equation becomes:
L - (3/6)L - (2/6)L = 3

Combine like terms:
L - (5/6)L = 3

Simplify further:
(1/6)L = 3

Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for L:
L = 3 * 6 = 18

Now that we know the total length of the stick is 18 meters, we can find the length of the stick that is in the water, which is 1/3 of the total length:
Length in water = (1/3) * 18 = 6

Therefore, the length of the stick in the water is 6 meters.

Selling price per fish = 350 Taka

Since the selling price is less than the cost price, the fish seller incurs a loss.

Loss per fish = Cost price - Selling price = 1600 - 350 = 1250 Taka

Loss percentage = (Loss / Cost price) * 100

1. Translation of the problem:
The problem states that there are two concentric circles with radii of 9 cm and 4 cm. We need to find the area between the perimeters of these two circles.

2. Solution:
The formula to calculate the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(A\) is the area and \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

For the larger circle with a radius of 9 cm:
\[A_{larger} = \pi \times 9^2 = \pi \times 81 = 81\pi\]

For the smaller circle with a radius of 4 cm:
\[A_{smaller} = \pi \times 4^2 = \pi \times 16 = 16\pi\]

The area between the two circles is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle:
\[A_{between} = A_{larger} - A_{smaller} = 81\pi - 16\pi = 65\pi\]

Since \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the numerical value:
\[A_{between} \approx 65 \times 3.14159 \approx 204.13 \, \text{cm}^2\]

First, we translate the Bengali problem into English:
""The product of two positive numbers is 162 and the quotient is 2; what are the numbers? Calculate the smaller number.""

Now, let's denote the two positive numbers as x and y, where x is the smaller number. We are given two conditions:

1. The product of the numbers is 162: x * y = 162
2. The quotient of the numbers is 2: y / x = 2

From the second condition, we can express y in terms of x: y = 2x

Now, substitute y = 2x into the first condition: x * 2x = 162
This simplifies to 2x^2 = 162

Divide both sides by 2: x^2 = 81

Take the square root of both sides: x = √81 = 9

So, the smaller number x is 9.

Therefore, the larger number y is 2x = 2 * 9 = 18.

Now, let's calculate the total population: 
2 crore = 2 * 10,000,000 = 20,000,000
89 lakh = 89 * 100,000 = 8,900,000
76 thousand = 76 * 1000 = 76,000
600 = 600

Total population = 20,000,000 + 8,900,000 + 76,000 + 600 = 28,976,600

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the distance between the two stations be \(d\) km.

The time taken to travel at 30 km/h is \( \frac{d}{30} \) hours.

The time taken to travel at 25 km/h is \( \frac{d}{25} \) hours.

According to the problem, \( \frac{d}{25} - \frac{d}{30} = \frac{10}{60} \) hours, because 10 minutes is \( \frac{10}{60} \) hours.

Simplifying the equation:

\( \frac{d}{25} - \frac{d}{30} = \frac{1}{6} \)

Finding a common denominator (150) for the fractions:

\( \frac{6d}{150} - \frac{5d}{150} = \frac{1}{6} \)

\( \frac{d}{150} = \frac{1}{6} \)

Multiplying both sides by 150:

\( d = \frac{150}{6} \)

\( d = 25 \)

Therefore, the distance between the two stations is 25 km.

Translation of the problem: 2 people can polish 1/3 of a door in one day. How many people are needed to polish 2/3 of the door in 2 days?

If 2 people can polish 1/3 of the door in 1 day, then the rate at which they work together is 1/3 of the door per day. This means that the total work done by 2 people in 1 day is 1/3.

To find the work rate per person, we divide the total work done in a day by the number of people:
Work rate per person per day = (1/3) / 2 = 1/6 of the door per day per person.

Now, we are asked how many people are needed to polish 2/3 of the door in 2 days. This means we need to find out how much work needs to be done per day to achieve 2/3 of the door polished in 2 days:
Total work needed = 2/3 of the door.
Time given = 2 days.

Work needed per day = Total work needed / Time given = (2/3) / 2 = 1/3 of the door per day.

Since one person can polish 1/6 of the door in a day, to polish 1/3 of the door in a day, we need:
Number of people needed = (1/3) / (1/6) = 2.

Therefore, to polish 2/3 of the door in 2 days, we still need 2 people, as the calculation shows that 2 people can maintain the required rate of polishing 1/3 of the door per day, which over 2 days amounts to 2/3 of the door.

Now, let's solve the problem. We know that the rate of work of the first pipe is 1/12 (since it fills the bathtub in 12 hours) and the rate of work of the second pipe is 1/18. 

When both pipes are opened together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates:
Combined rate = 1/12 + 1/18

Combined rate = 3/36 + 2/36
Combined rate = 5/36

**Translation:** Rajib, Debangana, Masum, and Tajmira can do 150 sums in 6 days. If they do an equal number of sums every day, how many days will it take Rajib and Tajmira to do 250 sums?

Now, let's solve the problem. 

First, we find out how many sums all four of them can do in one day.

150 sums / 6 days = 25 sums per day for all four.

Since there are four people, we divide the total daily sums by 4 to find out how many sums each person can do per day:

25 sums per day / 4 people = 6.25 sums per day per person.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for two people (Rajib and Tajmira) to do 250 sums at the rate of 6.25 sums per day per person.

Two people can do 6.25 * 2 = 12.5 sums per day.

To find out how many days it takes for them to do 250 sums:

250 sums / 12.5 sums per day = 20 days.

""Calculate the compound interest on 10,000 taka for 2 years at an annual interest rate of 8.50%.""

Now, let's solve the problem. The formula for compound interest is given by:

A = P(1 + r/100)^n

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest
P = principal amount (initial amount of money)
r = annual interest rate (in %)
n = number of years

Given:
P = 10,000 taka
r = 8.50%
n = 2 years

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 10,000(1 + 8.50/100)^2
A = 10,000(1 + 0.085)^2
A = 10,000(1.085)^2
A = 10,000 * 1.177225
A = 11,772.25

The compound interest is the difference between the amount and the principal:

CI = A - P
CI = 11,772.25 - 10,000
CI = 1,772.25

So, the compound interest on 10,000 taka for 2 years at an annual interest rate of 8.50% is 1,772.25 taka.

1. Translation of the problem:
The length of a book is 25 cm and the width is 18 cm. The book has 200 pages, and the thickness of each page is 0.1 mm. Calculate the volume of the book.

2. Solution:
First, convert all measurements to the same unit. Here, we'll use centimeters for easier calculation because the dimensions of the book are given in centimeters, and then we'll convert the thickness to centimeters since 1 cm = 10 mm.
- Length (L) = 25 cm
- Width (W) = 18 cm
- Thickness of each page = 0.1 mm = 0.01 cm (since 1 mm = 0.1 cm)
- Number of pages = 200

The area of one page = Length * Width = 25 cm * 18 cm = 450 square cm

The total thickness of the book = Number of pages * Thickness of each page = 200 * 0.01 cm = 2 cm

The volume of the book = Area of one page * Total thickness = 450 square cm * 2 cm = 900 cubic cm

Now, let's break it down:

1. First, we find the rate at which the tractors work. Since 4 tractors can cultivate 360 bigha in 20 days, we calculate the work done per day per tractor. The total work done is 360 bigha, and it takes 20 days for 4 tractors to complete this work.

2. Work done per day by 4 tractors = 360 bigha / 20 days = 18 bigha per day.

3. Work done per day by 1 tractor = 18 bigha per day / 4 tractors = 4.5 bigha per day per tractor.

4. Now, we need to find out how many tractors are needed to cultivate 1800 bigha in 10 days.

5. Total work to be done = 1800 bigha, and it needs to be completed in 10 days.

6. Work done per day required to complete 1800 bigha in 10 days = 1800 bigha / 10 days = 180 bigha per day.

7. Since 1 tractor can cultivate 4.5 bigha per day, to cultivate 180 bigha per day, we need = 180 bigha per day / 4.5 bigha per day per tractor = 40 tractors.

Therefore, to cultivate 1800 bigha of land in 10 days, 40 tractors will be needed.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total weight of the 3 oranges: 
   335 grams + 320 grams + 371 grams = 1026 grams

2. Calculate the average weight of the 3 oranges:

Given that 1 acre = 4046.8564224 square meters, we can convert 10 acres into square meters:
10 acres * 4046.8564224 square meters/acre = 40468.564224 square meters.

Let's denote the width of the field as W and the length as L. We are told that the length is 4 times the width, so L = 4W.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length * Width. Substituting the given values and relationship between length and width, we get:
40468.564224 = L * W

Let's assume the annual percentage profit rate is 'r'%. We know that the amount after 5 years will be double the principal amount, i.e., 2 * 13,000 = 26,000.

Using the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the annual percentage rate, and n is the number of years.

We can write the equation: 26000 = 13000(1 + r/100)^5.

Now, we need to solve for 'r'. Let's simplify the equation:

2 = (1 + r/100)^5

Taking the fifth root of both sides:

(1 + r/100) = 2^(1/5)
(1 + r/100) = 1.1487 (approximately)

Now, let's solve for 'r':

r/100 = 1.1487 - 1
r/100 = 0.1487
r = 0.1487 * 100
r = 14.87 (approximately)

So, the annual percentage profit rate is approximately 14.87%.

""Find the nearest perfect square number less than 5000.""

Now, let's proceed with solving the problem. We are looking for the perfect square number that is closest to 5000 but less than 5000. 

To find this, we can start by finding the square root of 5000, which is approximately 70.71. Since we're looking for a perfect square less than 5000, we consider the integer just below 70.71, which is 70.

The perfect square of 70 is 70^2 = 4900. 

Now, let's verify if there's another perfect square closer to 5000 but still less than 5000. The next higher perfect square would be 71^2 = 5041, which is greater than 5000. Therefore, 4900 is indeed the closest perfect square less than 5000.

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each window has 2 shutters.
2. There are 2 windows, so the total number of shutters is 2 x 2 = 4 shutters.
3. It takes 2 hours and 15 minutes to paint each shutter. To convert this to just hours, we can convert the minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 15 minutes / 60 = 0.25 hours. So, the total time to paint each shutter is 2 hours + 0.25 hours = 2.25 hours.
4. Since there are 4 shutters in total, the total time to paint all the shutters is 4 x 2.25 hours = 9 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Debu Babu to paint the two windows is 9 hours.

""A person took a loan of 5000 taka from a lending institution at an annual interest rate of 8% compounded annually. He repays 2000 taka at the end of each year. How much loan will he still have after repaying the 2nd installment?""

Now, let's calculate the amount of loan remaining after the 2nd installment.

Initially, the person takes a loan of 5000 taka. At the end of the 1st year, he has to pay an interest of 8% of 5000 taka, which is 0.08 x 5000 = 400 taka. So, the total amount due at the end of the 1st year is 5000 + 400 = 5400 taka. He repays 2000 taka, leaving a remaining balance of 5400 - 2000 = 3400 taka.

At the end of the 2nd year, he has to pay an interest of 8% of 3400 taka, which is 0.08 x 3400 = 272 taka. So, the total amount due at the end of the 2nd year is 3400 + 272 = 3672 taka. He repays 2000 taka, leaving a remaining balance of 3672 - 2000 = 1672 taka.

Therefore, after repaying the 2nd installment, the person will still have 1672 taka of loan remaining.

""The money is divided among Labib, Sami, and Siyam in the ratio of 5:4:2. If Siyam gets 180 taka, how much will Labib get?""

Given that the ratio of the money divided among Labib, Sami, and Siyam is 5:4:2, we can let the amounts they receive be 5x, 4x, and 2x, respectively.

Since Siyam receives 180 taka and his ratio is 2, we can set up the equation 2x = 180 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 180 / 2 = 90.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find out how much Labib will get by multiplying 5 (Labib's ratio) by x: 5x = 5 * 90 = 450.

Therefore, Labib will receive 450 taka.

""Salman has a purple ribbon that is 7.70 meters long, and a sky-blue ribbon that is 3.26 meters long. Salman wants to cut both ribbons into pieces of the same length, with the largest possible length, such that after cutting, 0.02 meters of each ribbon remains. We need to calculate the length of each piece.""

Now, let's solve the problem. 

First, we subtract the remaining length (0.02 meters) from each ribbon to find the total length that will be cut into pieces:
- Purple ribbon: 7.70 - 0.02 = 7.68 meters
- Sky-blue ribbon: 3.26 - 0.02 = 3.24 meters

The length of each piece should be a divisor of both 7.68 and 3.24. To find this, we can calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 7.68 and 3.24.

To simplify the calculation, we can convert the decimal numbers into fractions or find the GCD of the numbers after multiplying them by 100 to eliminate the decimals:
- 7.68 * 100 = 768
- 3.24 * 100 = 324

Now, we calculate the GCD of 768 and 324.

Using the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:
1. 768 = 2 * 324 + 120
2. 324 = 2 * 120 + 84
3. 120 = 1 * 84 + 36
4. 84 = 2 * 36 + 12
5. 36 = 3 * 12 + 0

The last non-zero remainder is 12, so the GCD of 768 and 324 is 12.

Since we multiplied the original lengths by 100, the GCD of the original lengths (in meters) is 12 / 100 = 0.12 meters.

Therefore, the length of each piece of ribbon will be 0.12 meters or 12 centimeters, as this is the largest length that can evenly divide both ribbons with the specified remainder.

The problem states: ""202* এর * অঙ্কটি কী হলে সংখ্যাটি পূর্ণবর্গ হবে তা হিসাব করি।""

Translated into English, it becomes: ""What should be the digit at the place of * in 202* so that the number is a perfect square?""

Now, let's analyze possible values for the digit at the place of * that would make 202* a perfect square.

One approach to solving this problem is to consider perfect squares close to 202* and see if any match the pattern. We're looking for a number that, when squared, results in a number in the 202* range.

Checking squares of numbers close to the square root of 2025 (since 2025 would be a likely candidate given it's a perfect square: 45^2 = 2025), we find:

- 44^2 = 1936
- 45^2 = 2025
- 46^2 = 2116

From this, we can see that 2025 is indeed a perfect square, and it matches the 202* pattern. Thus, the digit that should be at the place of * for the number to be a perfect square is 5.

Translation: Gold is 19.3 times heavier than water. A rectangular gold bar has a length of 7.8 cm, a width of 6.4 cm, and a height of 2.5 cm. What is the weight of the gold bar in grams?

Now, to find the weight of the gold bar, we first calculate its volume and then find its weight using the given density ratio with water.

1. Calculate the volume of the gold bar: 
Volume = length * width * height = 7.8 cm * 6.4 cm * 2.5 cm = 123.2 cubic cm.

2. Since 1 cubic cm of water weighs 1 gram, we use the density ratio to find the weight of the gold:
Weight of gold = Volume of gold bar * density ratio with water
Weight of gold = 123.2 cubic cm * 19.3 = 2377.36 grams

Now, we will solve the problem step by step.

Given that the income ratio of Solaiman and Salman is 5:7, we can express their incomes as 5x and 7x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

Given that the income ratio of Salman and Ifsuf is 4:5, we can express their incomes as 4y and 5y, respectively, where y is another common multiplier.

Since Salman's income is common in both ratios, we can equate 7x to 4y:

7x = 4y

We are also given that Solaiman's income is 120 taka, which means 5x = 120. Solving for x:

5x = 120
x = 120 / 5
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find Salman's income (7x):

Salman's income = 7x = 7 * 24 = 168

Since Salman's income is also equal to 4y, we can set up the equation:

168 = 4y
y = 168 / 4
y = 42

Now that we know y, we can find Ifsuf's income (5y):

Ifsuf's income = 5y = 5 * 42 = 210

Therefore, Ifsuf's income is 210 taka.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for simplicity. Since 1 meter = 100 cm, the total length of the bamboo stick is 2 meters = 200 cm.

The length painted red = 75 cm.

So, the length painted white = Total length - Length painted red = 200 cm - 75 cm = 125 cm.
