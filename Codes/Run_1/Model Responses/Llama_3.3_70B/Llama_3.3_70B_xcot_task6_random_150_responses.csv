638,"কোনো প্রকৃত ভগ্নাংশের লব ও হরের যোগফল ১৪ এবং বিয়োগফল ৮ হলে, ভগ্নাংশটি নির্ণয় কর।",৩/১১,"## Step 1: Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity.
The problem states that for a certain real fraction, the sum of its numerator and denominator is 14, and the difference between its numerator and denominator is 8. We need to find the fraction.

## Step 2: Represent the numerator and denominator algebraically.
Let's denote the numerator as ""n"" and the denominator as ""d"". According to the problem, we have two equations: n + d = 14 and n - d = 8.

## Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the values of the numerator and denominator.
To find the values of ""n"" and ""d"", we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's add the two equations together to eliminate ""d"": (n + d) + (n - d) = 14 + 8, which simplifies to 2n = 22.

## Step 4: Solve for the numerator ""n"".
Divide both sides of the equation 2n = 22 by 2 to solve for ""n"": n = 22 / 2 = 11.

## Step 5: Solve for the denominator ""d"".
Now that we have ""n"", we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for ""d"". Using n + d = 14 and substituting n = 11, we get 11 + d = 14. Subtracting 11 from both sides gives us d = 14 - 11 = 3.

## Step 6: Construct the fraction with the found numerator and denominator.
With the numerator ""n"" being 11 and the denominator ""d"" being 3, the fraction is 11/3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11/3}$"

The problem states that there are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 shirts in stock. These items are to be distributed equally among some families. We need to find out how many shirts each family will receive.

## Step 2: Identify the key information
To solve this problem, we need to identify the total number of items and the number of families among which the items will be distributed. However, the problem doesn't directly provide the number of families. Instead, it asks for the number of shirts each family will receive, implying that the distribution is based on the shirts.

## Step 3: Determine the distribution basis
Since the problem specifically asks for the number of shirts each family will receive, we should focus on the shirts. The distribution of shirts will determine how many families can receive an equal number of shirts.

## Step 4: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) if necessary
In problems like this, the GCD might be relevant if we were looking to distribute all items in a way that each family gets an equal number of each type of item. However, since the question only asks about shirts and implies distribution based on them, we don't necessarily need the GCD of all items.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of shirts per family
Given that we're only considering the distribution of shirts and the problem implies an equal distribution, we need to find the factors of 357 (the total number of shirts) to determine the possible number of families and thus the number of shirts each could receive. Since the question seems to imply a direct division without specifying the number of families, we might interpret it as looking for a factor that represents a reasonable number of families.

## Step 6: Consider reasonable factors for distribution
Looking at the factors of 357, we find that 357 = 3 * 7 * 17. Without more information on the number of families, a straightforward interpretation could be that each family gets one shirt, which doesn't require factoring. However, this step is about realizing that without a specified number of families, we look for a factor that could sensibly represent the number of shirts per family if we were dividing them evenly among a certain number of families.

## Step 7: Realize the question's implication
The question seems to simplify to how many shirts can be evenly distributed, suggesting a straightforward factor of the total shirts might be what's asked, without complex calculations involving"

## Step 2: Calculate the total area of the garden including the path.
To find the area of the garden including the path, we first need to calculate the outer dimensions of the garden with the path. The length including the path is 80 + 2*4 = 88 meters, and the width including the path is 60 + 2*4 = 68 meters. The total area of the garden with the path is 88 * 68 = 5984 square meters.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the cost of a notebook and a pencil.
Let's denote the cost of one notebook as 'n' rupees and the cost of one pencil as 'p' rupees.

## Step 3: Formulate the equations based on the given information.
From the first boy's purchase, we have the equation: 15n + 10p = 300.
From the second boy's purchase, we have the equation: 10n + 15p = 250.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the value of 'p'.
We can solve these equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to find 'p'.

## Step 5: Multiply the equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of 'n' in both equations are the same.
Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 gives us:
30n + 20p = 600 (multiplied the first equation by 2)
30n + 45p = 750 (multiplied the second equation by 3)

## Step 6: Subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate 'n'.
Subtracting the equations: (30n + 45p) - (30n + 20p) = 750 - 600, we get:
25p = 150

## Step 7: Solve for 'p'.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 25 gives us:
p = 150 / 25
p = 6

The problem states that there are trees and lampposts on a road. The trees are spaced 25 meters apart, and the lampposts are spaced 20 meters apart. We need to find out how far apart the trees and lampposts will be when they are together again, given that they are initially together at the start of the road.

## Step 2: Identify the key concept to solve the problem.
To find when and where the trees and lampposts will be together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the distances between them, which are 25 meters for the trees and 20 meters for the lampposts.

## Step 3: Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 25 and 20.
To find the LCM of 25 and 20, we first break down the numbers into their prime factors. 25 = 5^2 and 20 = 2^2 * 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved. So, LCM = 2^2 * 5^2 = 4 * 25 = 100.

## Step 4: Interpret the result in the context of the problem.
The LCM of 100 means that every 100 meters, the trees and lampposts will be together again, since 100 is the smallest distance that both 25 and 20 can divide into evenly.

The problem states that the selling price of a car is equal to 45% of the cost price of the car. We need to determine the percentage profit or loss.

## Step 2: Determine the cost price and selling price relationship.
Let's assume the cost price (CP) of the car is $100. According to the problem, the selling price (SP) is 45% of the cost price. So, SP = 0.45 * CP = 0.45 * $100 = $45.

## Step 3: Calculate the profit or loss.
To determine the profit or loss, we subtract the cost price from the selling price. Since SP < CP, there is a loss. Loss = CP - SP = $100 - $45 = $55.

## Step 4: Calculate the percentage loss.
The percentage loss is calculated by dividing the loss by the cost price and multiplying by 100. Percentage loss = (Loss / CP) * 100 = ($55 / $100) * 100 = 55%.

The problem states that in a cricket game, the total runs scored by Imran and Sumon is 58. Imran's runs are 5 less than twice the number of runs scored by Sumon. We need to find out how many runs Imran scored.

## Step 2: Define the variables for Imran's and Sumon's runs.
Let's denote Imran's runs as I and Sumon's runs as S.

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be turned into equations:
1. The total runs scored by Imran and Sumon is 58: I + S = 58.
2. Imran's runs are 5 less than twice the runs scored by Sumon: I = 2S - 5.

## Step 4: Solve the equations to find the value of I (Imran's runs).
We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for S:
Substituting I in the first equation: (2S - 5) + S = 58.
Combining like terms: 3S - 5 = 58.
Adding 5 to both sides: 3S = 63.
Dividing by 3: S = 21.

## Step 5: Calculate Imran's runs using the value of S.

The problem states that there is a field with a length of 40 meters and a width of 30 meters. Exactly in the middle of this field, there are two crossroads, each 1.5 meters wide, running diagonally. We need to find the total area of these two crossroads.

## Step 2: Calculate the length of the diagonal roads.
To find the area of the crossroads, we first need to calculate the length of the diagonals. The formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangle is given by \(d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}\), where \(l\) is the length and \(w\) is the width of the rectangle. Substituting the given values, we get \(d = \sqrt{40^2 + 30^2}\).

## Step 3: Perform the calculation of the diagonal length.
Calculating the length of the diagonal: \(d = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50\) meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the area of one diagonal road.
The area of one diagonal road can be calculated by multiplying the length of the diagonal by the width of the road. So, the area of one road is \(50 \times 1.5\).

## Step 5: Perform the calculation for the area of one diagonal road.
Calculating the area of one road: \(50 \times 1.5 = 75\) square meters.

## Step 6: Calculate the total area of both diagonal roads.
Since there are two roads, we need to multiply the area of one road by 2 to get the total area. However, because the roads intersect, we need to subtract the area of the intersection to avoid double counting. The intersection forms a square where the diagonals cross, with each side being 1.5 meters (the width of the roads). The area of this square is \(1.5 \times 1.5\).

## Step 7: Perform the calculations for the intersection area and the total area of both roads.
Calculating the intersection area: \(1.5 \times 1.5 = 2.25\) square meters. The total area of both roads, accounting for the intersection, is \(2 \times 75 - 2.25\).

The problem states that the area of a triangular piece of land is 216 square meters, and its base is 18 meters. We need to find the height of the triangle.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle
The formula for the area of a triangle is given by: Area = (base * height) / 2. We can use this formula to find the height of the triangle.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the formula
Given that the area is 216 square meters and the base is 18 meters, we can plug these values into the formula: 216 = (18 * height) / 2.

## Step 4: Solve for the height

The problem states that person A and person B together can complete a job in 16 days, person B and person C together can complete the same job in 12 days, and person A and person C together can complete the job in 20 days. We need to find out how many days it would take for all three, A, B, and C, to complete the job together.

## Step 2: Define the rates of work for each pair of workers.
Let's denote the rate of work of person A as A, person B as B, and person C as C. The rate of work is expressed in terms of how much of the job a person can complete in one day. Therefore, the combined rate of work for A and B is 1/16 (since they complete the job together in 16 days), for B and C is 1/12, and for A and C is 1/20.

## Step 3: Express the combined work rates as equations.
We have the following equations based on their combined work rates:
1. A + B = 1/16
2. B + C = 1/12
3. A + C = 1/20

## Step 4: Add the equations to find the combined rate of A, B, and C.
Adding all three equations gives us:
2(A + B + C) = 1/16 + 1/12 + 1/20

## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the fractions on the right side of the equation.
To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 240. Then convert each fraction:
1/16 = 15/240
1/12 = 20/240
1/20 = 12/240
So, 2(A + B + C) = 15/240 + 20/240 + 12/240 = 47/240

## Step 6: Solve for A + B + C.
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for A + B + C:
A + B + C = 47/480

## Step 7: Calculate the number of days for A, B, and C to complete the job together.
Since A + B + C represents the fraction of the job that all three can complete in one day, to find the number of days required for them to complete the job, we take"

The problem asks us to find the smallest number that is divisible by 6, 8, 10, and 12, and lies between 300 and 500.

## Step 2: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 6, 8, 10, and 12.
To find the smallest number divisible by 6, 8, 10, and 12, we need to calculate the LCM of these numbers. The prime factorization of each number is: 6 = 2 * 3, 8 = 2^3, 10 = 2 * 5, and 12 = 2^2 * 3.

## Step 3: Calculate the LCM using the prime factorizations.
The LCM is calculated by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. So, the LCM will have 2^3 (from 8), 3 (from 6 and 12), and 5 (from 10). Therefore, LCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120.

## Step 4: Find the smallest multiple of the LCM within the given range (300 to 500).
Since the LCM is 120, we need to find the smallest multiple of 120 that is greater than or equal to 300 and less than or equal to 500. We can start by dividing 300 by 120 to find the first multiple above 300.

## Step 5: Calculate the first few multiples of 120 until we find one within the range.
300 / 120 = 2.5, which means the first multiple of 120 above 300 is 120 * 3 = 360. This is within our target range of 300 to 500.

## Step 6: Verify that 360 is indeed divisible by 6, 8, 10, and 12.
360 is divisible by 6 (360 / 6 = 60), by 8 (360 / 8 = 45), by 10 (360 / 10 = 36), and by 12 (360 / 12 = 30). Thus, 360 meets all the criteria.

The problem states that the front wheel of an engine has a circumference of 14 decimeters, and the rear wheel has a circumference of 35 decimeters. We need to find the minimum distance the engine must travel so that both wheels complete an integer number of revolutions simultaneously.

## Step 2: Determine the conditions for simultaneous integer revolutions
For both wheels to complete an integer number of revolutions at the same time, the distance traveled by each wheel must be a multiple of its circumference. This implies that the distance traveled must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the circumferences of the two wheels.

## Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the wheel circumferences
To find the LCM of 14 and 35, we need to factorize these numbers. The prime factorization of 14 is 2 * 7, and the prime factorization of 35 is 5 * 7. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved. Hence, LCM = 2 * 5 * 7 = 70.

The problem asks us to find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35.

## Step 2: Identify the least common multiple (LCM) of the given numbers.
To find the smallest number divisible by 12, 15, 20, and 35, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the given numbers.

## Step 3: Break down each number into its prime factors.
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 15 = 3 * 5
- 20 = 2^2 * 5
- 35 = 5 * 7

## Step 4: Determine the LCM using the prime factors.
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^2 (from 12 and 20).
- The highest power of 3 is 3 (from 12 and 15).
- The highest power of 5 is 5 (from 15, 20, and 35).
- The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 35).
So, the LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420.

## Step 5: Find the smallest four-digit number divisible by the LCM.
Since the LCM (420) is less than 1000, we need to find the smallest multiple of 420 that is a four-digit number. We divide 1000 by 420 to see how many times 420 goes into 1000 and then round up to the nearest whole number since we're looking for the smallest four-digit number.

## Step 6: Calculate the smallest multiple of 420 that is over 1000.
1000 / 420 ≈ 2.381. This means 420 goes into 1000 approximately 2 times. To find the smallest four-digit number divisible by 420, we need to multiply 420 by the smallest integer that makes the product greater than or equal to 1000, which is 3.

## Step 2: Calculate the length of the ribbon after cutting off 3/8 of it.
First, we need to find the length of the ribbon after 3/8 is cut off. The original length of the ribbon is 50/3 meters. To find 3/8 of this length, we multiply 50/3 by 3/8.

## Step 3: Perform the multiplication to find the length cut off.
(50/3) * (3/8) = 50/8 meters. This simplifies to 25/4 meters.

## Step 4: Calculate the remaining length of the ribbon.
The remaining length of the ribbon is the original length minus the length cut off. So, it is (50/3) - (25/4).

## Step 5: Perform the subtraction by finding a common denominator.
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. Convert both fractions: (50/3) becomes (200/12) and (25/4) becomes (75/12).

## Step 6: Subtract the fractions.
(200/12) - (75/12) = (125/12) meters. This is the remaining length of the ribbon.

## Step 7: Divide the remaining length into 5 equal parts.
To find the length of one part, we divide the remaining length by 5. So, we calculate (125/12) / 5.

## Step 8: Perform the division.
(125/12) / 5 = (125/12) * (1/5) = 125/60. This simplifies to 25/12 meters.

The problem states that the sum of two numbers is 55, and the larger number is equal to 6 times the smaller number, while the smaller number is equal to 5 times the larger number. However, this seems to be a misunderstanding in translation. The correct translation should be: ""The sum of two numbers is 55, and 5 times the larger number is equal to 6 times the smaller number.""

## Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y.

## Step 3: Formulate the equations based on the problem
From the information given, we can form two equations. The first one is from the sum of the two numbers: x + y = 55. The second equation comes from the relationship between the two numbers: 5y = 6x.

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations
We can solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute into the other equation. Let's solve the first equation for y: y = 55 - x.

## Step 5: Substitute the expression for y into the second equation
Substituting y = 55 - x into 5y = 6x gives us 5(55 - x) = 6x.

## Step 6: Solve for x
Expanding the equation gives 275 - 5x = 6x. Adding 5x to both sides gives 275 = 11x. Dividing both sides by 11 gives x = 275 / 11 = 25.

## Step 7: Verify the solution
To ensure x = 25 is correct, we substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y and then check if both conditions (x + y = 55 and 5y = 6x) are met.

## Step 8: Calculate y using x = 25
Substituting x = 25 into x + y = 55 gives 25 + y = 55. Solving for y gives y = 55 - 25 = 30.

## Step 9: Check if 5y = 6x
Using x = 25 and y = 30, we check if 5y = 6x: 5*30 = 150 and 6*25 = 150. Since both sides are equal, the solution is correct.

The problem states that a movie theater charges 7.50 dollars for adults and 4.50 dollars for children. The total receipt for a movie show was 540 dollars. If 80 tickets were sold, we need to find out how many adult tickets were sold.

## Step 2: Define variables for the problem.
Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as ""A"" and the number of child tickets sold as ""C"". We know that A + C = 80 (total tickets sold) and 7.50A + 4.50C = 540 (total revenue from ticket sales).

## Step 3: Solve the first equation for one variable.
We can solve the equation A + C = 80 for C, which gives us C = 80 - A.

## Step 4: Substitute the expression from Step 3 into the second equation.
Substituting C = 80 - A into the equation 7.50A + 4.50C = 540 gives us 7.50A + 4.50(80 - A) = 540.

## Step 5: Simplify and solve for A.
Expanding the equation gives us 7.50A + 360 - 4.50A = 540. Combining like terms, we get 3A + 360 = 540. Subtracting 360 from both sides gives us 3A = 180. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us A = 60.

The problem states that out of 30 oranges in a box, we measured the weight of 3 oranges to be 235 grams, 120 grams, and 365 grams, respectively. We need to find the total weight of all 30 oranges based on the average weight.

## Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the 3 measured oranges
To find the average weight, first, we need to calculate the total weight of the 3 measured oranges. Total weight = 235 grams + 120 grams + 365 grams = 720 grams.

## Step 3: Calculate the average weight of the 3 measured oranges
To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of oranges measured. Average weight = Total weight / Number of oranges = 720 grams / 3 = 240 grams.

## Step 4: Calculate the total weight of all 30 oranges
Since we are assuming the average weight of the 3 oranges is representative of all 30 oranges, we can use this average weight to find the total weight of all 30 oranges. Total weight of 30 oranges = Average weight * Total number of oranges = 240 grams * 30.

## Step 5: Perform the multiplication to find the total weight in grams
Total weight of 30 oranges = 240 grams * 30 = 7200 grams.

## Step 6: Convert the total weight from grams to kilograms
Since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, we convert the total weight to kilograms. Total weight in kilograms = Total weight in grams / 1000 = 7200 grams / 1000 = 7.2 kilograms.

The problem states that a person has 5000 units of money, which is divided between two individuals such that the first person's amount is four times the amount of the second person. Additionally, if 1500 units are transferred from the first person to the second, their amounts become equal. We need to find the amount of money the second person initially has.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the amount of money the first person has as ""x"" and the amount the second person has as ""y"". According to the problem, x = 4y, and x + y = 5000.

## Step 3: Express x in terms of y using the first condition.
From the condition x = 4y, we can substitute x in the equation x + y = 5000 to get 4y + y = 5000, which simplifies to 5y = 5000.

## Step 4: Solve for y.
Dividing both sides of the equation 5y = 5000 by 5 gives y = 1000. This is the amount of money the second person initially has.

## Step 5: Verify the solution using the second condition.
If 1500 units are transferred from the first person to the second, the first person has x - 1500, and the second person has y + 1500. According to the problem, these amounts are equal: x - 1500 = y + 1500. Substituting x = 4y into this equation gives 4y - 1500 = y + 1500.

## Step 6: Solve the verification equation for y.
Rearranging the equation 4y - 1500 = y + 1500 gives 3y = 3000, which simplifies to y = 1000. This confirms our initial solution.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the ages of the trees.
Let's denote the current age of the banyan tree as B and the current age of the pine tree as P. We already know that P = 1432 years.

## Step 3: Calculate the age of the pine tree 150 years ago.
Since the pine tree is currently 1432 years old, 150 years ago, it was 1432 - 150 = 1282 years old.

## Step 4: Use the information from 150 years ago to set up an equation.
150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the two trees was 2961 years. So, if the banyan tree was B - 150 years old 150 years ago, then the equation becomes: (B - 150) + 1282 = 2961.

## Step 5: Solve the equation for the current age of the banyan tree.
Simplifying the equation: B - 150 + 1282 = 2961, which becomes B + 1132 = 2961. Subtracting 1132 from both sides gives B = 2961 - 1132.

The problem translates to: ""What is the smallest natural number by which 432 should be multiplied to get a perfect square number?""

## Step 2: Prime factorize 432 to identify the factors that need to be paired to make a perfect square.
First, we prime factorize 432. We find that 432 = 2^4 * 3^3.

## Step 3: Identify the factors that need an additional pair to make each prime's exponent even.
From the prime factorization, we see that the factor of 3 has an odd exponent (3^3), meaning we need one more 3 to make its exponent even.

## Step 4: Determine the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 432, will provide the necessary factors to make a perfect square.
To achieve a perfect square, we need to ensure all prime factors have even exponents. Since 3 is the only prime factor with an odd exponent, we need one more 3. Thus, the smallest natural number to multiply by 432 is 3.

## Step 5: Verify the result by checking if the product of 432 and the chosen number is indeed a perfect square.
Multiplying 432 by 3 gives 1296. The prime factorization of 1296 is 2^4 * 3^4, which confirms that 1296 is a perfect square (36^2).

The problem translates to: ""At a 5% interest rate, how much profit can be made from 10,000 rupees in 10 years?""

## Step 2: Identify the type of interest calculation needed.
Since the problem involves calculating the future value of an investment based on a given interest rate over a period of time, we will use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (initial investment).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

## Step 3: Determine the values for the formula.
Given that:
- P = 10,000 rupees (initial investment)
- r = 5% or 0.05 (as a decimal)
- n = 1 (compounded annually, as not specified otherwise)
- t = 10 years

## Step 4: Apply the values to the compound interest formula.
A = 10,000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*10)
A = 10,000(1 + 0.05)^10
A = 10,000(1.05)^10

## Step 5: Calculate the future value.
To find the future value, we calculate (1.05)^10 and then multiply by 10,000.
(1.05)^10 ≈ 1.62889
A ≈ 10,000 * 1.62889
A ≈ 16,288.90

## Step 6: Calculate the profit made.
The profit made is the difference between the amount accumulated after 10 years and the initial investment.
Profit = A - P
Profit ≈ 16,288.90 - 10,000
Profit ≈ 6,288.90

The final answer is: **6288.90**"

The problem states: ""If 15 ball pens are bought for 75 taka and sold for 90 taka, what percentage of profit will be made?""

## Step 2: Calculate the cost price per ball pen
To find the cost price per ball pen, we divide the total cost by the number of ball pens. cost_price_per_pen = total_cost / number_of_pens = 75 / 15 = 5 taka per pen.

## Step 3: Calculate the selling price per ball pen
The selling price per ball pen can be found by dividing the total selling price by the number of ball pens. selling_price_per_pen = total_selling_price / number_of_pens = 90 / 15 = 6 taka per pen.

## Step 4: Calculate the profit per ball pen
The profit per ball pen is the difference between the selling price per pen and the cost price per pen. profit_per_pen = selling_price_per_pen - cost_price_per_pen = 6 - 5 = 1 taka per pen.

## Step 5: Calculate the total profit
The total profit is the profit per pen multiplied by the number of pens. total_profit = profit_per_pen * number_of_pens = 1 * 15 = 15 taka.

## Step 6: Calculate the percentage profit
The percentage profit is calculated by dividing the total profit by the total cost and then multiplying by 100. percentage_profit = (total_profit / total_cost) * 100 = (15 / 75) * 100 = 20%.

The problem states that due to an increase in annual profit from 8% to 10%, Tisha's income increased by 128 rupees over 4 years. We need to find out her initial capital.

## Step 2: Calculate the difference in annual profit percentage.
The difference in annual profit percentage is 10% - 8% = 2%.

## Step 3: Determine the total increase in profit over 4 years.
Since the increase in profit is 2% per year, over 4 years, the total increase would be 4 * 2% = 8% of the initial capital.

## Step 4: Set up the equation to find the initial capital.
Let's denote the initial capital as C. The increase in income over 4 years is 128 rupees, which is equal to 8% of the initial capital. So, the equation becomes: 8% of C = 128.

## Step 5: Convert the percentage to a decimal and solve for C.
8% as a decimal is 0.08. So, the equation is 0.08 * C = 128. To find C, we divide both sides by 0.08: C = 128 / 0.08.

The problem states that a rectangular room has a perimeter equal to that of a square room. The length of the rectangular room is three times its width. The floor of the room is covered with carpet at a cost of 75 Tk per square meter, and the total cost is 11025 Tk. We need to find out how many 40 cm x 40 cm square tiles are required to cover the floor of the square room.

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the rectangular room.
Let's denote the width of the rectangular room as W and the length as 3W. The perimeter of the rectangular room is 2(W + 3W) = 8W. Since the perimeter of the rectangular room is equal to the perimeter of the square room, we can set up an equation: 8W = 4s, where s is the side length of the square room. Therefore, s = 2W.

## Step 3: Calculate the cost and area of the rectangular room.
The total cost of covering the floor with carpet is 11025 Tk at a rate of 75 Tk per square meter. We can calculate the area of the rectangular room as follows: Area = Total Cost / Rate = 11025 / 75 = 147 square meters.

## Step 4: Express the area of the rectangular room in terms of W.
The area of the rectangular room is given by length times width, so we have: Area = W * 3W = 3W^2. We know the area is 147 square meters, so 3W^2 = 147.

## Step 5: Solve for W.
Divide both sides by 3 to isolate W^2: W^2 = 147 / 3 = 49. Taking the square root of both sides gives W = 7.

## Step 6: Calculate the side length of the square room.
Since s = 2W, we substitute W = 7 into this equation to get: s = 2 * 7 = 14 meters.

## Step 7: Calculate the area of the square room.
The area of the square room is s^2 = 14^2 = 196 square meters.

## Step 8: Convert the area of the square room to square centimeters.
Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 1 square meter = 10000 square centimeters. Thus,"

The problem states that to paint 3/5 square meters of wall, 1/3 deciliters (DL) of paint is required. We need to find out how many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deciliter (DL) of paint.

## Step 2: Understand the given ratio of paint to wall area.
The given ratio is 1/3 DL of paint to 3/5 square meters of wall. This means for every 1/3 DL of paint, 3/5 square meters of wall can be painted.

## Step 3: Determine the amount of wall that can be painted per unit of paint.
To find out how much wall can be painted with 1 DL of paint, we first need to establish the ratio of wall area to paint. Currently, we have 3/5 square meters of wall per 1/3 DL of paint. We need to scale this up to 1 DL of paint.

## Step 4: Calculate the wall area that can be painted with 1 DL of paint.
First, find out how many times 1/3 DL fits into 1 DL. Since 1 DL = 3 * (1/3 DL), the wall area that can be painted with 1 DL of paint is 3 times the area that can be painted with 1/3 DL of paint. Therefore, we multiply the wall area that can be painted with 1/3 DL of paint (which is 3/5 square meters) by 3.

The problem states that in a certain garden, 1800 saplings are to be planted in a square pattern, but 36 more saplings are available. We need to determine the number of saplings in each row.

## Step 2: Formulate the problem mathematically.
Let's denote the number of saplings in each row as 'x'. Since the saplings are planted in a square pattern, the total number of saplings will be x^2. However, we know that there are 36 more saplings than needed, so the total number of saplings available is x^2 + 36, which should be equal to 1800.

## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
We can set up the equation x^2 + 36 = 1800, since the total number of saplings available is 1800, but we need to find the square that is closest to this number.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
First, we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation: x^2 = 1800 - 36. This simplifies to x^2 = 1764.

## Step 5: Find the square root of 1764 to determine the value of x.
Taking the square root of 1764 gives us x = √1764 = 42.

The problem states that there are 1071 dhotis, 595 saris, and 357 kurtas in stock. These items are to be evenly distributed among some families. We need to find out how many dhotis each family will receive.

## Step 2: Identify the key elements of the problem
To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) or the highest common factor (HCF) of the given quantities (1071, 595, and 357) since the distribution needs to be even and without any remainder.

## Step 3: Calculate the GCD of the given quantities
To find the GCD, we can start by finding the prime factors of each number or use the Euclidean algorithm. However, given the numbers are not straightforward to factorize without calculation, we'll consider a more direct approach to find a common divisor, focusing on the fact that the distribution must result in whole numbers of items per family.

## Step 4: Apply the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization
Let's examine if there's a straightforward common factor:
- For 1071, 595, and 357, finding common factors directly is challenging without detailed factorization. We aim for the highest number that can divide all three without leaving a remainder.

## Step 5: Determine the distribution based on GCD
Upon inspection, we find that the numbers 1071, 595, and 357 have a common factor. To distribute the items evenly, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these numbers. After calculation or inspection, we can determine the GCD.

## Step 6: Calculate the GCD
Calculating or inspecting the factors:
- 1071 = 3 * 7 * 17 * 3
- 595 = 5 * 7 * 17
- 357 = 3 * 7 * 17

The common factors among all are 7 * 17 = 119, which means each family can receive items in multiples of 119 to ensure even distribution without leftovers.

## Step 7: Determine the number of dhotis per family
Given the GCD (119), we divide the total number of dhotis by this GCD to find out how many sets of 119 dhotis can be distributed, which directly gives us the number of dhotis per family since the distribution is even.

The problem states that one number is 9 less than twice the other number, and the sum of the two numbers is 42. We need to find the larger number.

## Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y.

## Step 3: Formulate the equations based on the problem statement
From the problem, we have two equations:
1. y = 2x - 9 (since one number is 9 less than twice the other)
2. x + y = 42 (since the sum of the two numbers is 42)

## Step 4: Substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation
Substituting y = 2x - 9 into x + y = 42 gives us x + (2x - 9) = 42.

## Step 5: Solve the equation for x
Expanding the equation gives us x + 2x - 9 = 42.
Combining like terms yields 3x - 9 = 42.
Adding 9 to both sides gives us 3x = 51.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 17.

## Step 6: Find the value of y using the value of x
Now that we have x = 17, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. Using y = 2x - 9, we get y = 2(17) - 9 = 34 - 9 = 25.

## Step 7: Identify the larger number
Since y = 25 and x = 17, y is the larger number.

The final answer is: **25**"

The problem states that a tank can hold 8000 liters of water. The length of the tank is given as 2.56 meters and the width is given as 1.25 meters. We need to find the depth of the tank.

## Step 2: Understand the formula to calculate the volume of the tank.
The volume of a rectangular tank can be calculated using the formula: Volume = length * width * depth. We are given the volume (8000 liters) and the dimensions of the tank (length = 2.56 meters, width = 1.25 meters). We need to convert the volume from liters to cubic meters because the dimensions are in meters. 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters, so 8000 liters = 8 cubic meters.

## Step 3: Apply the formula to find the depth of the tank.
Using the formula Volume = length * width * depth, we can rearrange it to find the depth: Depth = Volume / (length * width). Plugging in the given values, we get Depth = 8 / (2.56 * 1.25).

## Step 4: Perform the calculation to find the depth.
First, calculate the denominator: 2.56 * 1.25 = 3.2. Then, divide the volume by this result to find the depth: Depth = 8 / 3.2.

## Step 5: Calculate the final value of the depth.
Depth = 8 / 3.2 = 2.5 meters.

The problem states that a fruit seller has a total amount of fruits where 1/2 of them are apples, 1/3 are oranges, and there are 40 mangoes. We need to find the total number of fruits the seller has.

## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information.
Let's denote the total number of fruits as ""T"". According to the problem, 1/2 of T are apples, 1/3 of T are oranges, and there are 40 mangoes. So, the equation can be written as: T = (1/2)T + (1/3)T + 40.

## Step 3: Solve the equation for T.
First, we need to find a common denominator for 1/2 and 1/3, which is 6. Then we rewrite the equation: T = (3/6)T + (2/6)T + 40. Combining like terms gives us: T = (5/6)T + 40.

## Step 4: Isolate T on one side of the equation.
To solve for T, we subtract (5/6)T from both sides of the equation, resulting in: T - (5/6)T = 40. Simplifying this gives us: (1/6)T = 40.

## Step 5: Solve for T.
To isolate T, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6, which gives us: T = 40 * 6.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of fruits.
Performing the multiplication gives us the total number of fruits: T = 240.

Monowara Begum took some money at a 6% interest rate and some money at a 4% interest rate for her family needs. She took a total of 56,000 rupees in loans and finally paid 2,840 rupees in interest. If 5% interest is applicable on the entire loan, what is the annual interest?

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the amount of money taken at 6% interest as x and the amount taken at 4% interest as y.

## Step 3: Formulate the equations based on the given information.
We have two pieces of information: the total amount of money taken (x + y = 56,000) and the total interest paid (0.06x + 0.04y = 2,840).

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
First, we'll express y in terms of x from the first equation: y = 56,000 - x.

## Step 5: Substitute y in the second equation.
Substituting y = 56,000 - x into 0.06x + 0.04y = 2,840 gives 0.06x + 0.04(56,000 - x) = 2,840.

## Step 6: Solve for x.
Expanding the equation gives 0.06x + 2,240 - 0.04x = 2,840. Simplifying it results in 0.02x = 600, which means x = 30,000.

## Step 7: Find y.
Substituting x = 30,000 into y = 56,000 - x gives y = 26,000.

## Step 8: Calculate the annual interest if 5% interest is applicable on the entire loan.
The total loan amount is 56,000 rupees. If 5% interest is applicable, the annual interest would be 0.05 * 56,000.

The problem states: ""Write the ratio of the three angles of a right-angled isosceles triangle.""

## Step 2: Recall the properties of a right-angled isosceles triangle.
A right-angled isosceles triangle has one right angle (90 degrees) and two equal acute angles. Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, we can find the measure of the acute angles.

## Step 3: Calculate the measure of the acute angles.
Let x be the measure of each acute angle. We know that x + x + 90 = 180, because the triangle is right-angled and isosceles.

## Step 4: Solve for x.
Combine like terms: 2x + 90 = 180.
Subtract 90 from both sides: 2x = 90.
Divide both sides by 2: x = 45.

## Step 5: Determine the ratio of the three angles.
The right angle is 90 degrees, and the two acute angles are each 45 degrees. Therefore, the ratio of the angles is 45:45:90.

## Step 6: Simplify the ratio.
Since the two acute angles are equal, we can simplify the ratio by dividing all terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 45. Thus, the simplified ratio is 1:1:2.

The problem states that on this year's Republic Day, the physical education teacher of our school made us stand in rows of 12, 15, and 20 at different times and perform various drills. At one point, he also arranged us in a perfect square formation. We need to calculate the minimum number of students who were present in school that day.

## Step 2: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, and 20.
To find the minimum number of students, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, and 20, since the total number of students must be divisible by each of these numbers to form complete rows.

## Step 3: Calculate the LCM of 12, 15, and 20.
The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3, of 15 is 3 * 5, and of 20 is 2^2 * 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved: 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60.

## Step 4: Consider the perfect square formation.
Since the students were also arranged in a perfect square, the total number of students must be a perfect square. We need to find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60, as the number of students must satisfy both conditions (being a multiple of 60 and a perfect square).

## Step 5: Find the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60.
The smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 60 can be found by squaring the lowest common multiple of the prime factors of 60 that would result in a perfect square. Since 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, to make it a perfect square, we need each prime factor to be raised to an even power. Thus, we consider 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 900, which is a perfect square and a multiple of 60.

The problem states that in a rectangular room, the length is one and a half times the width. The area of the room is given as 216 square meters, and we are asked to find the perimeter.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the dimensions of the room
Let's denote the width of the room as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is one and a half times the width, so we can express the length in terms of the width as L = 1.5W.

## Step 3: Use the given area to set up an equation
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula Area = Length * Width. Substituting the given area of 216 square meters and the expression for the length (L = 1.5W) into the formula, we get 216 = 1.5W * W.

## Step 4: Solve the equation for the width
The equation from Step 3 simplifies to 216 = 1.5W^2. To find W, we first divide both sides by 1.5, giving us W^2 = 216 / 1.5 = 144. Then, taking the square root of both sides, we find W = √144 = 12.

## Step 5: Calculate the length using the width
Now that we know the width (W = 12 meters), we can find the length using the relationship L = 1.5W. Substituting W = 12 into this equation gives us L = 1.5 * 12 = 18 meters.

## Step 6: Calculate the perimeter of the room
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Substituting the length (L = 18 meters) and the width (W = 12 meters) into this formula, we get Perimeter = 2 * (18 + 12) = 2 * 30 = 60 meters.

It was found that when the saplings are planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30, there are an equal number of saplings in each row. We need to find the minimum number of saplings sent by the panchayat.

## Step 2: Identify the conditions for the number of saplings.
To have an equal number of saplings in each row when planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30, the total number of saplings must be divisible by 20, 24, and 30.

## Step 3: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 20, 24, and 30.
The LCM of these numbers will give us the minimum number of saplings that can be evenly distributed in rows of 20, 24, or 30. First, we break down each number into its prime factors: 20 = 2^2 * 5, 24 = 2^3 * 3, and 30 = 2 * 3 * 5.

## Step 4: Calculate the LCM from the prime factors.
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations. So, for 2, the highest power is 2^3 (from 24), for 3, it's 3^1 (from 24 and 30), and for 5, it's 5^1 (from 20 and 30). Thus, the LCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120.

## Step 5: Conclusion
The minimum number of saplings that can be planted in rows of 20, 24, or 30 with an equal number in each row is the LCM of these numbers.

Out of this, forest area covers around 7,547,400 square kilometers, and river basin covers 25,030,000 square kilometers. We need to find the area of the remaining part, excluding the forest and river basin.

## Step 2: Calculate the total area covered by the forest and river basin.
To find the area of the remaining part, we first need to calculate the total area covered by the forest and river basin. This can be done by adding the areas of the forest and river basin. Total covered area = forest area + river basin area = 7,547,400 + 25,030,000 = 32,577,400 square kilometers.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the remaining part.
Now, we subtract the total covered area from the total area of the country to find the area of the remaining part. Remaining area = total area - total covered area = 32,872,630 - 32,577,400 = 295,230 square kilometers.

The problem states that 1/2 of a stick is in the ground, 1/3 of the stick is in the water, and the remaining part is above the water. The length of the part above the water is 3 meters.

## Step 2: Determine the fraction of the stick that is above the water.
Since 1/2 of the stick is in the ground and 1/3 of the stick is in the water, we can find the fraction of the stick that is above the water by subtracting the sum of these fractions from 1. So, the fraction above the water is 1 - (1/2 + 1/3).

## Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the stick above the water.
To calculate the fraction above the water, we first find a common denominator for 1/2 and 1/3, which is 6. Then we convert the fractions: (1/2) becomes (3/6) and (1/3) becomes (2/6). The sum of these fractions is (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6. Therefore, the fraction of the stick above the water is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.

## Step 4: Calculate the total length of the stick.
Given that the part above the water is 3 meters and this represents 1/6 of the stick, we can calculate the total length of the stick. If 1/6 of the stick is 3 meters, then the total length of the stick is 3 / (1/6) = 3 * 6 = 18 meters.

## Step 5: Calculate the length of the stick in the water.
Now that we know the total length of the stick is 18 meters and 1/3 of it is in the water, we can calculate the length of the stick in the water. 1/3 of 18 meters is (1/3) * 18 = 6 meters.

The problem states that a fish seller buys Hilsa fish at 1600 Taka each and sells them at 350 Taka each. We need to determine the percentage of profit or loss incurred by the seller.

## Step 2: Determine the cost price and selling price of each fish.
The cost price (CP) of each fish is 1600 Taka, and the selling price (SP) of each fish is 350 Taka.

## Step 3: Calculate the loss incurred on each fish.
Since the selling price is less than the cost price, the seller incurs a loss. The loss on each fish can be calculated as: Loss = CP - SP = 1600 - 350 = 1250 Taka.

## Step 4: Calculate the percentage of loss.
To calculate the percentage of loss, we use the formula: (Loss / CP) * 100 = (1250 / 1600) * 100.

The problem states that there are two concentric circles with radii of 9 cm and 4 cm. We need to find the area of the region between the perimeters of the two circles.

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the larger circle.
To find the area between the perimeters, we first calculate the area of the larger circle using the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. For the larger circle, the area A1 = π(9)^2 = 81π.

## Step 3: Calculate the area of the smaller circle.
Next, we calculate the area of the smaller circle using the same formula. For the smaller circle, the area A2 = π(4)^2 = 16π.

## Step 4: Find the area between the perimeters of the two circles.
The area between the perimeters of the two circles is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle. So, the area between the perimeters = A1 - A2 = 81π - 16π = 65π.

## Step 5: Calculate the numerical value of the area.
Since π is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the numerical value of the area by multiplying 65 by π. However, for exactness, we keep the answer in terms of π or calculate it as requested.

The problem states that the product of two positive numbers is 162 and their ratio is 2. We need to find the two numbers and then identify the smaller one.

## Step 2: Define the two positive numbers.
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. We are given two pieces of information: the product of the numbers (x*y = 162) and their ratio (y/x = 2).

## Step 3: Express y in terms of x using the ratio.
From the ratio y/x = 2, we can express y as y = 2x.

## Step 4: Substitute y in the product equation.
Substituting y = 2x into the equation x*y = 162, we get x*(2x) = 162, which simplifies to 2x^2 = 162.

## Step 5: Solve for x.
To find x, we divide both sides of the equation 2x^2 = 162 by 2, resulting in x^2 = 81. Taking the square root of both sides gives us x = 9 (since x is a positive number).

## Step 6: Find y using the value of x.
Now that we have x = 9, we can find y using the equation y = 2x. Thus, y = 2*9 = 18.

## Step 7: Identify the smaller number.
From the calculated values, x = 9 is the smaller number.

The problem states that the population of a city is two million eight hundred ninety-seven thousand six hundred. Out of this population, there are 12,500,500 men and 8,872,435 women. We need to calculate the number of children.

## Step 2: Calculate the total population of men and women.
To find the number of children, we first need to calculate the total population of men and women. The total population of men is given as 12,500,500 and the total population of women is given as 8,872,435.

## Step 3: Add the population of men and women to find the total adult population.
Total adult population = population of men + population of women = 12,500,500 + 8,872,435 = 21,372,935.

## Step 4: Calculate the total population of the city.
The total population of the city is given as two million eight hundred ninety-seven thousand six hundred, which can be written numerically as 2,897,600.

## Step 5: Find the number of children by subtracting the total adult population from the total city population.
Number of children = Total city population - Total adult population = 2,897,600 - 21,372,935.

## Step 6: Perform the subtraction to find the number of children.
However, upon reviewing the calculation, it becomes apparent that the total adult population (21,372,935) exceeds the total city population (2,897,600), which is not possible in this context as the total city population should be greater than or equal to the total adult population. This indicates an error in the given problem statement or the numbers provided.

## Step 7: Correct the approach based on the error found.
Given the error in the previous steps due to the impossibility of the total adult population exceeding the total city population, we must re-evaluate the problem statement. The task was to calculate the number of children, but the provided numbers lead to a logical inconsistency.

## Step 8: Reassess the problem with正确 calculations.
If we were to follow the original intent and correct any oversights: the calculation of children would typically involve subtracting the known adult populations from the total population. However, the given numbers do not allow for a logical or mathematically correct calculation of children as the sum of adults exceeds the total population, indicating a mistake in the problem as stated"

The problem states that a train travels from Kamalapur station to Narayanganj station at a speed of 30 km/h. If the speed were 25 km/h, it would take 10 minutes more. We need to find the distance between the two stations.

## Step 2: Define the variables and establish the relationship between speed, distance, and time.
Let's denote the distance between the two stations as ""d"" km. The time taken to cover this distance at 30 km/h is d/30 hours, and at 25 km/h is d/25 hours. According to the problem, the difference in time taken is 10 minutes, which is 1/6 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

The problem states that Bivash and his friends are planning to form a drama team with either 8 members or 10 members. We need to find the minimum number of people required so that they can form both types of teams.

## Step 2: Identify the conditions for forming both types of teams.
To form a team of 8 members, the total number of people must be divisible by 8. Similarly, to form a team of 10 members, the total number of people must be divisible by 10.

## Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 10.
The LCM of 8 and 10 will give us the minimum number of people required to form both types of teams. The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3, and the prime factorization of 10 is 2 * 5.

## Step 4: Calculate the LCM of 8 and 10.
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization. So, the LCM of 8 and 10 is 2^3 * 5 = 40.

## Step 5: Determine the minimum number of people required.
Since the LCM of 8 and 10 is 40, Bivash and his friends must have at least 40 people to form both types of teams (8 members or 10 members) without any issues.

The problem states that the sum of the ages of a father and son is 55 years, and the father's age is four times the son's age. We need to find the father's age.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the son's age as ""S"" and the father's age as ""F"".

## Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given information.
From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be turned into equations:
1. The sum of their ages is 55: F + S = 55
2. The father's age is four times the son's age: F = 4S

## Step 4: Solve the system of equations.
We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the value of S.
Substituting F = 4S into F + S = 55 gives us 4S + S = 55, which simplifies to 5S = 55.

## Step 5: Solve for S.
Divide both sides of the equation 5S = 55 by 5 to solve for S: S = 55 / 5 = 11.

## Step 6: Solve for F using the value of S.
Now that we know S = 11, we can find F by substituting S back into one of the original equations: F = 4S = 4 * 11 = 44.

The problem states that 2 people can polish 1/3 of a door in one day. We need to find out how many people are required to polish 2/3 of the door in 2 days.

## Step 2: Determine the work rate of 2 people.
2 people can polish 1/3 of the door in 1 day, which means their combined work rate is 1/3 of the door per day.

## Step 3: Calculate the work rate required to polish 2/3 of the door in 2 days.
To polish 2/3 of the door in 2 days, the required work rate is (2/3) / 2 = 1/3 of the door per day.

## Step 4: Compare the required work rate with the work rate of 2 people.
Since the required work rate (1/3 of the door per day) is the same as the work rate of 2 people (1/3 of the door per day), we can conclude that 2 people are sufficient to polish 2/3 of the door in 2 days, but we need to consider if the calculation directly translates to the number of people needed based on the given rates and time frames.

## Step 5: Consider the relationship between work rate, time, and the amount of work done.
Given that 2 people can do 1/3 of the work in 1 day, it implies that in 2 days, 2 people can do 2/3 of the work, as the work done is directly proportional to the time spent working at a constant rate. Therefore, the calculation directly supports the conclusion that 2 people are sufficient for the task described, without needing additional personnel.

The problem states that there are two pipes in a tank. The first pipe can fill the empty tank in 12 hours, and the second pipe can fill the empty tank in 18 hours. We need to find out how long it will take to fill the tank if both pipes are opened together.

## Step 2: Determine the rate of work for each pipe
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate of work for each pipe. The rate of work is the amount of work done per unit time. For the first pipe, the rate of work is 1 tank / 12 hours, which can be simplified to 1/12 tank per hour. For the second pipe, the rate of work is 1 tank / 18 hours, which can be simplified to 1/18 tank per hour.

## Step 3: Calculate the combined rate of work for both pipes
When both pipes are opened together, their rates of work are added. So, the combined rate of work is (1/12 + 1/18) tanks per hour. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 36 in this case. Therefore, the combined rate of work is (3/36 + 2/36) = 5/36 tanks per hour.

## Step 4: Calculate the time required to fill the tank
Now that we know the combined rate of work, we can calculate the time required to fill the tank. Since the combined rate of work is 5/36 tanks per hour, the time required to fill 1 tank is the reciprocal of the combined rate, which is 36/5 hours.

The problem states that Rajiv, Debangana, Masum, and Tajmira together can complete 150 units of work in 6 days. We need to find out how many days it will take for Rajiv and Tajmira to complete 250 units of work, assuming each person works at the same rate every day.

## Step 2: Determine the total daily work rate of all four individuals.
First, we calculate the total work done per day by all four individuals. Since they complete 150 units of work in 6 days, their combined work rate per day is 150 / 6 = 25 units per day.

## Step 3: Calculate the work rate per person per day.
To find out how much work each person does per day, we divide the total daily work rate by the number of individuals. So, each person's work rate per day is 25 / 4 = 6.25 units per day.

## Step 4: Calculate the combined work rate of Rajiv and Tajmira per day.
Since we are interested in the time it takes for Rajiv and Tajmira to complete 250 units of work, we need their combined work rate per day. The combined work rate of Rajiv and Tajmira per day is 6.25 + 6.25 = 12.5 units per day.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of days required for Rajiv and Tajmira to complete 250 units of work.
To find out how many days it will take for Rajiv and Tajmira to complete 250 units of work at their combined rate, we divide the total work by their combined daily work rate. So, the number of days required is 250 / 12.5 = 20 days.

The problem states: ""Determine the compound interest of 10,000 taka for 2 years at an annual compound interest rate of 8.50%.""

## Step 2: Identify the formula for compound interest
The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

## Step 3: Plug in the values given in the problem
Given that P = 10,000 taka, r = 8.50% or 0.085 as a decimal, n = 1 (since the interest is compounded annually), and t = 2 years, we can substitute these values into the formula.

## Step 4: Calculate the amount after 2 years
Using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), we get:
A = 10,000(1 + 0.085/1)^(1*2)
A = 10,000(1 + 0.085)^2
A = 10,000(1.085)^2
A = 10,000 * 1.177225
A = 11,772.25

## Step 5: Calculate the compound interest
The compound interest (CI) can be found by subtracting the principal amount from the amount accumulated after 2 years:
CI = A - P
CI = 11,772.25 - 10,000
CI = 1,772.25

The problem states that 360 bigha of land requires 4 tractors to be cultivated in 20 days. We need to calculate how many tractors are required to cultivate 1800 bigha of land in 10 days.

## Step 2: Determine the rate at which one tractor can cultivate the land.
First, we calculate the total work done by 4 tractors in 20 days. Since 4 tractors can cultivate 360 bigha in 20 days, we find the work rate per tractor per day. The formula to find the work rate is: Work = Rate * Time. Here, Work is 360 bigha, Rate is what we are trying to find per tractor per day, and Time is 20 days with 4 tractors. So, the rate per tractor per day can be found by rearranging the formula: Rate = Work / (Time * Number of tractors).

## Step 3: Calculate the rate per tractor per day.
Substitute the given values into the formula: Rate = 360 bigha / (20 days * 4 tractors) = 360 / 80 = 4.5 bigha per tractor per day.

## Step 4: Calculate the total work required for 1800 bigha in 10 days.
Now, we have the rate at which one tractor can cultivate land (4.5 bigha per day) and we need to find out how many tractors are needed to cultivate 1800 bigha in 10 days. The total work required is 1800 bigha, and the time available is 10 days.

## Step 5: Determine the number of tractors needed.
Using the work rate formula again (Work = Rate * Time), we rearrange it to find the number of tractors needed: Number of tractors = Work / (Rate * Time). Substituting the values: Number of tractors = 1800 bigha / (4.5 bigha/tractor/day * 10 days).

## Step 6: Perform the final calculation.
Number of tractors = 1800 / (4.5 * 10) = 1800 / 45 = 40.

## Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the 3 measured oranges.
To find the average weight, first, we need to calculate the total weight of the 3 oranges that were measured. Total weight = 335 grams + 320 grams + 371 grams = 1026 grams.

## Step 3: Calculate the average weight of the 3 measured oranges.
To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of oranges. Average weight = Total weight / Number of oranges = 1026 grams / 3 = 342 grams.

## Step 4: Calculate the total weight of all 20 oranges based on the average weight.
Since we are assuming the average weight of the 3 oranges is representative of all 20 oranges, we can use this average to calculate the total weight of all 20 oranges. Total weight of 20 oranges = Average weight * Total number of oranges = 342 grams * 20.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation for the total weight of 20 oranges.
Total weight of 20 oranges = 342 grams * 20 = 6840 grams.

## Step 6: Convert the total weight from grams to kilograms.
Since the problem asks for the total weight in kilograms, we need to convert grams to kilograms. 1 kilogram = 1000 grams. Total weight in kilograms = Total weight in grams / 1000 = 6840 grams / 1000 = 6.84 kilograms.

The problem states that a rectangular field has an area of 10 acres and its length is 4 times its width. We need to find the length of the field in meters.

## Step 2: Convert the area from acres to square meters.
First, we need to convert the area from acres to square meters. Since 1 acre is equal to 4046.8564224 square meters, we can calculate the area in square meters: 10 acres * 4046.8564224 square meters/acre = 40468.564224 square meters.

## Step 3: Define the relationship between the length and the width of the field.
Let's denote the width of the field as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is 4 times the width, so L = 4W.

## Step 4: Use the formula for the area of a rectangle to set up an equation.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length * Width. We can set up an equation using the given area and the relationship between the length and the width: 40468.564224 = L * W. Substituting L = 4W into the equation, we get 40468.564224 = 4W * W.

## Step 5: Solve the equation for W.
Simplifying the equation, we get 40468.564224 = 4W^2. Dividing both sides by 4, we get 10117.141056 = W^2. Taking the square root of both sides, we get W = sqrt(10117.141056).

## Step 6: Calculate the value of W.
Calculating the square root, we get W = 100.57 meters (approximately).

## Step 7: Calculate the length of the field.
Since L = 4W, we can calculate the length: L = 4 * 100.57 = 402.28 meters.

The problem states: ""What is the annual percentage profit, by which 13,000 taka will double itself with interest in 5 years?""

## Step 2: Understand the problem and identify the variables.
We are given the principal amount (P) as 13,000 taka, the time period (n) as 5 years, and the amount after 5 years (A) as twice the principal, which is 26,000 taka. We need to find the annual percentage profit (r).

## Step 3: Apply the formula for compound interest to find the rate.
The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the annual percentage profit, and n is the time period in years.

## Step 4: Plug in the given values into the formula.
Substitute A = 26,000, P = 13,000, and n = 5 into the formula: 26,000 = 13,000(1 + r/100)^5.

## Step 5: Simplify the equation and solve for r.
Divide both sides by 13,000: 2 = (1 + r/100)^5. Take the fifth root of both sides: (1 + r/100) = 2^(1/5). Solve for r: r/100 = 2^(1/5) - 1. Multiply both sides by 100 to find r.

## Step 6: Calculate the value of r.
r = (2^(1/5) - 1) * 100. Using a calculator, 2^(1/5) ≈ 1.1487. So, r ≈ (1.1487 - 1) * 100 ≈ 0.1487 * 100 ≈ 14.87.

The problem states that Debubabu is painting his new house and today he will paint two windows of the same size by himself. Each window has two panels. If it takes him 2 hours and 15 minutes to paint each panel, we need to calculate the total time it will take Debubabu to paint the two windows.

## Step 2: Convert the time to paint one panel into minutes
To make calculations easier, we first convert the time to paint one panel into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding the 15 minutes, it takes 120 + 15 = 135 minutes to paint one panel.

## Step 3: Calculate the total time to paint one window
Since each window has two panels, and it takes 135 minutes to paint one panel, the total time to paint one window is 2 * 135 = 270 minutes.

## Step 4: Calculate the total time to paint two windows
To find the total time to paint two windows, we multiply the time to paint one window by 2. So, 2 * 270 = 540 minutes.

## Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to hours
To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 540 / 60 = 9 hours.

The problem states that a person takes a loan of 5000 rupees from a lending institution at an annual compound interest rate of 8%. The person repays 2000 rupees at the end of each year. We need to find out how much loan amount will remain after the second installment is paid.

## Step 2: Calculate the interest accrued in the first year.
To find the interest accrued in the first year, we use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal amount (initial loan), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years. Since the interest is compounded annually, n = 1. The interest rate r is 8% or 0.08 in decimal. The principal amount P is 5000 rupees, and t = 1 year for the first year. Thus, the interest accrued in the first year is A = 5000(1 + 0.08/1)^(1*1) - 5000 = 5000(1 + 0.08) - 5000 = 5000 * 1.08 - 5000 = 5400 - 5000 = 400 rupees.

## Step 3: Calculate the remaining loan amount after the first installment is paid.
After the first year, the total amount owed is 5000 (initial loan) + 400 (interest) = 5400 rupees. The person repays 2000 rupees at the end of the first year. Thus, the remaining loan amount after the first installment is paid is 5400 - 2000 = 3400 rupees.

## Step 4: Calculate the interest accrued in the second year.
Using the same compound interest formula as in Step 2 but now with the principal amount P being the remaining loan amount after the first payment (3400 rupees), we calculate the interest accrued in the second year. A = 3400(1 + 0.08/1)^(1*1) = 3400(1 + 0.08) = 3400 * 1.08 = 3668 rupees. The interest accrued in the second year is 366"

The problem states that a certain amount of money is divided among Labib, Sami, and Siyam in the ratio 5:4:2. We are given that Siyam received 180 taka, and we need to determine how much Labib will receive.

## Step 2: Express the given ratio in terms of a variable.
Let's assume the common ratio unit is x. So, the amounts received by Labib, Sami, and Siyam can be expressed as 5x, 4x, and 2x, respectively.

## Step 3: Use the information given about Siyam's amount to find the value of x.
Since Siyam received 180 taka, we can set up the equation 2x = 180 to find the value of x.

## Step 4: Solve for x.
Dividing both sides of the equation 2x = 180 by 2, we get x = 90.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount received by Labib.
Now that we know x = 90, we can find the amount received by Labib by multiplying 5 and x, which gives us 5 * 90 = 450.

The problem states that Solomon has 7.70 meters of purple ribbon and Medina has 3.26 meters of sky-blue ribbon. They want to cut both ribbons into pieces of the same length, with the largest possible length, such that after cutting, 0.02 meters of each ribbon remains.

## Step 2: Calculate the total length of each ribbon minus the remaining length
To find the length that will be cut into equal pieces, we subtract the remaining length from the total length of each ribbon. For the purple ribbon: 7.70 - 0.02 = 7.68 meters. For the sky-blue ribbon: 3.26 - 0.02 = 3.24 meters.

## Step 3: Determine the common factors of the adjusted lengths
We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7.68 and 3.24 to determine the largest length of the pieces that can be cut from both ribbons.

## Step 4: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7.68 and 3.24
To find the GCD of 7.68 and 3.24, we can use the Euclidean algorithm or list the factors of each number. First, convert both numbers to centimeters for easier calculation: 7.68 meters = 768 cm and 3.24 meters = 324 cm. The factors of 768 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 768. The factors of 324 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 81, 108, 162, 324. The greatest common factor they share is 12.

## Step 5: Calculate the length of each piece
The GCD found is in centimeters, so the largest length of the pieces that can be cut from both ribbons is 12 cm, which is equivalent to 0.12 meters.

The problem asks us to find the digit that, when placed in the blanks of the number 202**, will make the number a perfect square.

## Step 2: Understand the properties of perfect squares
To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of perfect squares. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares because they can be expressed as 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, and 5^2, respectively.

## Step 3: Identify the possible range of numbers
Since the number 202** is a four-digit number, we can start by finding the square roots of the smallest and largest possible four-digit numbers. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999. We need to find the square roots of these numbers to determine the possible range of integers whose squares could result in a four-digit number.

## Step 4: Calculate the square roots of the smallest and largest four-digit numbers
The square root of 1000 is approximately 31.62, and the square root of 9999 is approximately 99.99. This means that the possible integers whose squares could result in a four-digit number range from 32 to 99.

## Step 5: Look for perfect squares within the range
We need to find perfect squares within this range that have the digits 202 as the first three digits. This requires checking the squares of numbers between 32 and 99 to see if any of them match the pattern 202**.

## Step 6: Check the squares of numbers within the range
Checking the squares of numbers within the range, we find that 44^2 = 1936, 45^2 = 2025, and 46^2 = 2116. We notice that 45^2 = 2025 matches the pattern 202**.

## Step 7: Determine the digit that makes the number a perfect square
From step 6, we see that when the digit ** is 25, the number 202** becomes a perfect square (2025 = 45^2).

The problem states that Tanvir's farm has 50 horses and 60 cows. Each cow gives birth to 2 calves per year. We need to find out the total number of animals on the farm after one year.

## Step 2: Calculate the initial total number of animals on the farm.
Initially, there are 50 horses and 60 cows, making a total of 50 + 60 = 110 animals.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of new calves born after one year.
Since each cow gives birth to 2 calves per year and there are 60 cows, the total number of new calves born after one year will be 60 * 2 = 120.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of animals on the farm after one year.
The total number of animals after one year will be the sum of the initial animals (50 horses + 60 cows) and the new calves born (120). So, the total will be 110 (initial animals) + 120 (new calves) = 230 animals.

The problem states that a 2-meter long bamboo stick has 75 centimeters of its length painted red, and the rest of the length is painted white. We need to find the ratio of the total length of the bamboo stick to the length that is painted white.

## Step 2: Convert the total length of the bamboo stick into centimeters for uniformity.
Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, the total length of the bamboo stick in centimeters is 2 meters * 100 centimeters/meter = 200 centimeters.

## Step 3: Calculate the length of the bamboo stick that is painted white.
The length painted white is the total length minus the length painted red, which is 200 centimeters - 75 centimeters = 125 centimeters.

## Step 4: Determine the ratio of the total length of the bamboo stick to the length painted white.
The ratio of the total length to the length painted white is the total length divided by the length painted white, which is 200 centimeters / 125 centimeters.

The problem asks to find a two-digit number between 50 and 100, where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers is 16 and the sum of the two numbers is 144, and then identify the larger of these two numbers.

## Step 2: Identify the possible range for the two-digit numbers.
Given that the numbers must be between 50 and 100, and their GCD is 16, we can consider numbers that are multiples of 16 within this range. The multiples of 16 between 50 and 100 are 64 and 80, and 96.

## Step 3: Determine the pairs of numbers that have a GCD of 16 and a sum of 144.
We need to find pairs of numbers within the specified range that not only have a GCD of 16 but also sum up to 144. Considering the multiples of 16 (64, 80, 96), we look for pairs that meet both conditions.

## Step 4: Examine potential pairs.
- For 64: The other number would need to be 144 - 64 = 80, which is a multiple of 16 and thus could be a valid pair since their GCD is 16.
- For 80: The other number would be 144 - 80 = 64, which we've already identified as a potential pair.
- For 96: The other number would be 144 - 96 = 48, which does not fall within our initial range of multiples of 16 between 50 and 100.

## Step 5: Confirm the pair that satisfies both conditions and identify the larger number.
The pair (64, 80) satisfies both conditions: their GCD is 16, and their sum is 144. Between these two, 80 is the larger number.

The problem states that the sum of two numbers is 160, and one number is three times the other. We need to find the larger number.

## Step 2: Define the variables for the problem.
Let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. According to the problem, y = 3x (since one number is three times the other), and x + y = 160 (since their sum is 160).

## Step 3: Substitute y in the sum equation with 3x to solve for x.
Substituting y = 3x into the equation x + y = 160, we get x + 3x = 160, which simplifies to 4x = 160.

## Step 4: Solve for x.
To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation 4x = 160 by 4, resulting in x = 160 / 4 = 40.

## Step 5: Find the value of y using the relationship between x and y.
Since y = 3x, we substitute x = 40 into this equation to find y: y = 3 * 40 = 120.
