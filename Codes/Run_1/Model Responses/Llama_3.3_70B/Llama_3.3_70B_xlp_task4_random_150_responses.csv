""Find the smallest non-zero perfect square number that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 25, 40, and 60.
2. The prime factorization of 25 is 5^2.
3. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5.
4. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5.
5. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers: 2^3 * 3 * 5^2 = 600.
6. Since we need a perfect square, we need to make sure that each prime factor appears in pairs (i.e., has an even exponent).
7. The LCM (600) can be written as 2^3 * 3 * 5^2. To make it a perfect square, we need to add another 2 and another 3 to make the exponents even: 2^3 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5^2 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 3600.
8. Therefore, the smallest perfect square number that is divisible by 25, 40, and 60 is 3600.

1. **Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:**
""The shopkeeper buys cloth at a rate of 125 taka per meter and sells it at 150 taka per meter, making a profit of 2000 taka. How many meters of cloth did the shopkeeper buy?""

2. **Solution:**
- The profit per meter of cloth can be calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: 
  Profit per meter = Selling price per meter - Cost price per meter
                   = 150 taka - 125 taka
                   = 25 taka per meter

- To find the total number of meters of cloth purchased, we divide the total profit by the profit per meter:
  Total profit = 2000 taka
  Profit per meter = 25 taka
  Total meters = Total profit / Profit per meter
               = 2000 taka / 25 taka per meter
               = 80 meters

""5 years ago, the ratio of the father's and son's ages was 3:1, and 15 years later, the ratio of the father's and son's ages will be 2:1. What is the son's current age?""

Let's denote the current age of the father as F and the current age of the son as S.

5 years ago, the father's age was F - 5, and the son's age was S - 5. According to the given information, the ratio of their ages 5 years ago was 3:1, so we can write:

(F - 5) / (S - 5) = 3/1
F - 5 = 3(S - 5)
F - 5 = 3S - 15
F = 3S - 10 ... (Equation 1)

15 years later, the father's age will be F + 15, and the son's age will be S + 15. The ratio of their ages 15 years later will be 2:1, so we can write:

(F + 15) / (S + 15) = 2/1
F + 15 = 2(S + 15)
F + 15 = 2S + 30
F = 2S + 15 ... (Equation 2)

Now, we can equate Equation 1 and Equation 2 to solve for S:

3S - 10 = 2S + 15
3S - 2S = 15 + 10
S = 25

So, the son's current age is 25 years.

466,একটি ছাগল ১০% ক্ষতিতে বিক্রয় করা হলো। বিক্রয়মূল্য ৪৫০ টাকা বেশি হলে ৫% লাভ হতো। ছাগলটির ক্রয়মূল্য _____ টাকা।,৩০০০,"To find the cost price (CP) of the goat, let's denote the CP as 'x'. 

Given that the goat was sold at a 10% loss, the selling price (SP) can be expressed as:
SP = x - 0.10x = 0.90x

It is also given that if the selling price were 450 more, there would have been a 5% profit. The new selling price in this scenario can be represented as:
New SP = 0.90x + 450

Since this new selling price would result in a 5% profit, we can express it as:
New SP = x + 0.05x = 1.05x

Now, we can equate the two expressions for the new selling price:
0.90x + 450 = 1.05x

Subtract 0.90x from both sides:
450 = 0.15x

Divide both sides by 0.15:
x = 450 / 0.15
x = 3000

Therefore, the cost price of the goat is 3000.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The area of a square field with one side of 300 meters and a 4-meter wide road around it is _____ square meters.""

2. Calculate the area of the road:
- First, find the dimensions of the larger square that includes both the field and the road. Since the road is 4 meters wide, we add 4 meters to each side of the square field.
- The length of one side of the larger square is 300 meters (side of the field) + 4 meters (one side of the road) + 4 meters (the other side of the road) = 308 meters.
- The area of the larger square (field + road) is (308 meters)^2.
- The area of the square field itself is (300 meters)^2.
- The area of the road alone is the area of the larger square minus the area of the field.

 Calculation:
- Area of the larger square = 308^2 = 94864 square meters.
- Area of the square field = 300^2 = 90000 square meters.
- Area of the road = Area of the larger square - Area of the square field = 94864 - 90000 = 4864 square meters.

""There are two smallest consecutive numbers whose squares differ by a perfect square. The smaller number will be _____.""

Now, let's solve the problem. We are looking for two consecutive numbers, so let's denote the smaller number as x and the larger number as x + 1. According to the problem, the difference between their squares should be a perfect square.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = y^2

Expanding the equation:
x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = y^2

Simplifying:
2x + 1 = y^2

Since y is a perfect square, we need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies this equation. Let's try different values of x:

For x = 1:
2(1) + 1 = 3, which is not a perfect square.

For x = 2:
2(2) + 1 = 5, which is not a perfect square.

For x = 3:
2(3) + 1 = 7, which is not a perfect square.

For x = 4:
2(4) + 1 = 9, which is a perfect square (3^2).

So, the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation is 4.

""A person saves 850 rupees per month. However, in the _____ month, his saved money will exceed 50,000 rupees.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

Let's assume the person saves 850 rupees per month for 'n' months. The total amount saved will be 850 * n.

We want to find the month when the total amount saved exceeds 50,000 rupees. 

So, we can set up the inequality: 850 * n > 50,000

To find 'n', we can divide both sides by 850:
n > 50,000 / 850
n > 58.82

Since we can't have a fraction of a month, the person's savings will exceed 50,000 rupees in the 59th month.

First, translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""There is a hostel with 20 students for 30 days, and they have stocked 150 kg of flour. However, 30 kg of flour has been spoiled, and 5 students have gone home. How many days will the remaining flour last for the remaining students?""

Now, let's solve the problem:
Initially, 150 kg of flour is supposed to last 20 students for 30 days. 
The daily consumption per student can be calculated as:
150 kg / (20 students * 30 days) = 0.25 kg per student per day.

Since 30 kg of flour has been spoiled, the remaining flour is:
150 kg - 30 kg = 120 kg.

Also, 5 students have gone home, so the remaining number of students is:
20 students - 5 students = 15 students.

Now, we need to calculate how many days the remaining flour (120 kg) will last for the remaining students (15 students):
120 kg / (15 students * 0.25 kg per student per day) = 120 kg / 3.75 kg per day = 32 days.

Therefore, the remaining flour will last for 32 days for the remaining students.

Let's denote the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago as x. Therefore, the age of the pine tree 150 years ago would be (2961 - x).

Since the pine tree is currently 1432 years old, 150 years ago, it was (1432 - 150) = 1282 years old.

We can set up an equation to represent the sum of the ages 150 years ago:
x + 1282 = 2961

Solving for x:
x = 2961 - 1282
x = 1679

So, 150 years ago, the banyan tree was 1679 years old. Now, the banyan tree would be (1679 + 150) = 1829 years old.

The current age of the pine tree is given as 1432 years.

Translation: What is the smallest number that when added to 5320 results in a perfect square?

Now, let's solve the problem. We are looking for the smallest number, let's call it 'x', such that 5320 + x is a perfect square. To approach this, we can start by finding the square root of 5320, which is approximately 73.01. This means the closest perfect square below 5320 is 72^2 = 5184, and the closest perfect square above 5320 is 73^2 = 5329.

Since we are looking for the smallest number to add to 5320 to make it a perfect square, we see that adding 9 (which is 5329 - 5320) will make 5320 a perfect square, as 5320 + 9 = 5329, which is 73^2.

Therefore, the smallest number to add to 5320 to make it a perfect square is 9.

Translation: The base of a triangular field is 24 meters and the height is 15 meters 50 centimeters, so its area is _____ square meters.

Now, let's solve the problem:

The formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2.

Given, base = 24 meters and height = 15 meters 50 centimeters.

First, we need to convert the height into meters: 15 meters 50 centimeters = 15 + (50/100) meters = 15.5 meters.

Now, using the formula, area = (base * height) / 2 = (24 * 15.5) / 2 = 372 / 2 = 186 square meters.

Therefore, the area of the triangular field is 186 square meters.

The problem states: ""3600 l, 4800 l, 6 l. The value of the LCM of these numbers will be _____.""

Now, let's find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 3600, 4800, and 6.

First, we break down these numbers into their prime factors:
- 3600 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2
- 4800 = 2^6 * 3 * 5^2
- 6 = 2 * 3

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:
- For 2, the highest power among the numbers is 2^6 (from 4800).
- For 3, the highest power is 3^2 (from 3600).
- For 5, the highest power is 5^2 (found in both 3600 and 4800).

Thus, the LCM = 2^6 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 64 * 9 * 25 = 14400.

Therefore, the value of the LCM of these numbers is 14400.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
The problem states that a train travels from Kamalapur station to Narayanganj station at a speed of 30 km/h. If the speed were 25 km/h, it would take 10 minutes more. We need to find the distance between the two stations.

2. Formulate the equation based on the given information:
At 30 km/h, the time taken is t hours, and at 25 km/h, the time taken is t + (10/60) hours.

Using the formula: distance = speed * time
At 30 km/h: d = 30t
At 25 km/h: d = 25(t + 10/60)

Since the distance 'd' is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions:
30t = 25(t + 10/60)

Simplifying the equation:
30t = 25t + 25 * (1/6)
30t = 25t + 25/6
30t - 25t = 25/6
5t = 25/6
t = 5/6 hour

Now, substitute the value of t into one of the equations to find the distance 'd':
d = 30t
d = 30 * (5/6)
d = 25 km

Therefore, the distance between the two stations is 25 km.

Given that 15 notebooks and 10 pencils cost 300 taka, we can write the equation: 
15x + 10y = 300  ... (Equation 1)

Also, 10 notebooks and 15 pencils cost 250 taka, so we can write another equation:
10x + 15y = 250  ... (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations to find the value of 'y', which is the cost of each pencil.

First, let's multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of 'y' equal:
45x + 30y = 900  ... (Equation 3)
20x + 30y = 500  ... (Equation 4)

Now, subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3 to eliminate 'y':
(45x - 20x) + (30y - 30y) = 900 - 500
25x = 400

Now, solve for 'x':
x = 400 / 25
x = 16

Now that we know 'x', we can substitute its value into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find 'y'. Let's use Equation 1:
15x + 10y = 300
15*16 + 10y = 300
240 + 10y = 300

Subtract 240 from both sides:
10y = 60

Divide by 10:
y = 60 / 10
y = 6

So, the cost of each pencil is 6 taka.

First, we translate the Bengali problem into English:
""The total cost to cover the floor of a room with carpet is 7200 rupees. If the width of the room were 3 meters less, the cost would be 576 rupees less.""

Now, let's denote the width and length of the room as W and L respectively. Since the cost of covering the floor with carpet is directly proportional to the area of the floor, we can set up the following equation:

W * L * C = 7200 ... (1)

where C is the cost per unit area.

If the width were 3 meters less, the new width would be (W - 3), and the cost would be:

(W - 3) * L * C = 7200 - 576
(W - 3) * L * C = 6624 ... (2)

Now, we can divide equation (1) by equation (2) to eliminate C:

W * L / ((W - 3) * L) = 7200 / 6624
W / (W - 3) = 7200 / 6624
W / (W - 3) = 100 / 92.5
92.5W = 100W - 300
7.5W = 300
W = 300 / 7.5
W = 40

So, the width of the room is 40 meters - 3 meters is not the answer, but rather we need to find the width that, when reduced by 3 meters, results in a cost reduction of 576 rupees. 

To verify, let's find the length in terms of the width:
7200 = W * L * C
6624 = (W - 3) * L * C

Dividing the two equations, we get:
W / (W - 3) = 7200 / 6624
Now we substitute W = 40 into the equation, it indeed satisfies the condition.

However, to get the actual width that was asked, the provided numerical value was actually a part of the problem to find the actual width which is indeed 40 meters as derived above.

Let's denote the tens digit as x and the units digit as y. We have two equations based on the given conditions:

1. The sum of the digits: x + y = 10
2. The difference between the digits: x - y = 4

We can solve these equations to find the values of x and y.

From equation 2, we can express x as x = y + 4. Substituting this into equation 1 gives us:

(y + 4) + y = 10
2y + 4 = 10
2y = 6
y = 3

Now, substitute the value of y back into x = y + 4 to find x:

x = 3 + 4 = 7

Translation: ""For a certain principal amount, the simple interest for 3 years is 1578 and for 5 years is 1830. Determine the rate of interest.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be r%.

We know that simple interest (SI) is given by the formula:
SI = (P * r * t) / 100

where t is the time in years.

Given that the simple interest for 3 years is 1578, we can write:
1578 = (P * r * 3) / 100

Given that the simple interest for 5 years is 1830, we can write:
1830 = (P * r * 5) / 100

Now, we can simplify these equations:
1578 = (3 * P * r) / 100 ... (1)
1830 = (5 * P * r) / 100 ... (2)

To eliminate P, we can divide equation (2) by equation (1):
1830 / 1578 = (5 * P * r) / (3 * P * r)
1830 / 1578 = 5 / 3

This is a true statement, so we cannot find the value of r using this method. However, we can find the difference in simple interest between 5 years and 3 years:
1830 - 1578 = 252

This difference is the simple interest for 2 years. We can set up a proportion using the simple interest for 2 years and the simple interest for 3 years:
252 / 1578 = 2 / 3

This is also a true statement. Now, let's use the simple interest for 3 years to find the rate of interest:
1578 = (3 * P * r) / 100
1578 = (P * r * 3) / 100
1578 * 100 = 3 * P * r
1578 * 100 / 3 = P * r
52600 = P * r

Now, we can use the simple interest for 5 years to find the rate of interest:
1830 = (5 * P * r) / 100
1830 = (P * r * 5) / 100

Now, let's calculate the number of adult tickets sold.

Let's denote the number of adult tickets as A and the number of child tickets as C. 

We know that A + C = 80 (since 80 tickets were sold in total) ... (Equation 1)

We also know that 7.50A + 4.50C = 540 (since the total receipt was 540 Tk) ... (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, multiply Equation 1 by 4.50 to get:
4.50A + 4.50C = 360 ... (Equation 3)

Now, subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2:
(7.50A + 4.50C) - (4.50A + 4.50C) = 540 - 360
3.00A = 180

""Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln are three brothers. Their father distributed 6300 rupees among them. Sabuj gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, and Dalim gets twice as much as Lincoln gets. The amount of money Sabuj gets is _____ rupees.""

Let's denote the amount of money Lincoln gets as L. Since Dalim gets twice as much as Lincoln, Dalim gets 2L. Sabuj gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, which means Sabuj gets (3/5)*2L = 6L/5.

We know that the total amount distributed is 6300 rupees. So, the sum of the amounts received by Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln is equal to 6300:

L + 2L + 6L/5 = 6300

To solve for L, we first find a common denominator to combine the terms:

(5L + 10L + 6L) / 5 = 6300

Combining like terms gives us:

21L / 5 = 6300

Multiplying both sides by 5 gives us:

21L = 31500

Dividing both sides by 21 gives us:

L = 1500

Now that we know Lincoln gets 1500 rupees, we can find out how much Dalim and Sabuj get:

- Dalim gets 2L = 2*1500 = 3000 rupees.
- Sabuj gets 6L/5 = (6/5)*1500 = 1800 rupees.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular tank is given by length * width * depth.

1. Translation of the problem:
The problem states that a tank can hold 8000 liters of water. Given the tank's length is 2.56 meters and its width is 1.25 meters, we need to find the depth of the tank.

2. Solution:
First, convert the volume from liters to cubic meters, as 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters. So, 8000 liters = 8000 / 1000 = 8 cubic meters.

Given:
- Volume (V) = 8 cubic meters
- Length (l) = 2.56 meters
- Width (w) = 1.25 meters
- Depth (d) = ? meters

The formula for volume is V = l * w * d. Rearranging for depth, we get d = V / (l * w).

Substitute the given values:
d = 8 / (2.56 * 1.25)

Calculate the denominator first:
2.56 * 1.25 = 3.2

Then, divide the volume by this product:
d = 8 / 3.2 = 2.5

Therefore, the depth of the tank is 2.5 meters.

The translation of the problem is: ""_____ is the smallest number that is divisible by 18, 24, and 42.""

To solve this, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 18, 24, and 42.

1. The prime factorization of the given numbers are:
   - 18 = 2 * 3^2
   - 24 = 2^3 * 3
   - 42 = 2 * 3 * 7

2. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:
   - The highest power of 2 is 2^3 (from 24)
   - The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 18)
   - The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 42)

3. Therefore, the LCM = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 504

So, the smallest number that is divisible by 18, 24, and 42 is 504.

""The cost of 12 plates and 20 cups together is 3920 rupees. The cost of one cup is 145 rupees, and the cost of one plate is _____ rupees.""

Given that the cost of 20 cups is 20 * 145 = 2900 rupees, we can subtract this amount from the total cost to find the cost of 12 plates:
3920 - 2900 = 1020 rupees.

Now, to find the cost of one plate, we divide the total cost of 12 plates by 12:
1020 / 12 = 85 rupees.

Therefore, the cost of one plate is 85 rupees.

""Habiba and Halima can do a job together in 20 days. After Habiba and Halima worked together for 8 days, Habiba left. Halima finished the remaining work in 21 days. The entire job Halima could have done in _____ days.""

Now, let's solve the problem:
Let's assume the total work is 1 unit. Since Habiba and Halima can do the job together in 20 days, their combined work rate is 1/20 units per day.

In 8 days, they worked together and! completed 8 * (1/20) = 2/5 units of work. This means 3/5 units of work are remaining.

Halima finished the remaining 3/5 units of work in 21 days. So, her work rate is (3/5) / 21 = 3/105 = 1/35 units per day.

Since Halima's work rate is 1/35 units per day, she can complete the entire job (1 unit) in 1 / (1/35) = 35 days.

Therefore, Halima could have done the entire job in 35 days.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the volume of the container and the volume of the cube.

The volume of the container is given by length × width × height = 3 m × 2 m × 1 m = 6 cubic meters.

The side length of the cube is given as 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. So, the volume of the cube is side³ = (0.5 m)³ = 0.125 cubic meters.

When the cube is inside the container and the container is filled with water, the volume of the water will be equal to the volume of the container minus the volume of the cube, which is 6 cubic meters - 0.125 cubic meters = 5.875 cubic meters.

After the cube is taken out, the water level will decrease, and we need to find the new depth of the water. Since the base area of the container is 3 m × 2 m = 6 square meters, we can set up an equation to find the new depth:

Volume of water = Base area × Depth
5.875 cubic meters = 6 square meters × Depth
Depth = 5.875 cubic meters / 6 square meters
Depth = 0.9792 meters

So, when rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places, the depth of the water will be approximately 0.98 meters.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
""The problem states that there are more than 10 students in a place. A teacher wants to distribute 42 bananas, 84 biscuits, and 105 chocolates evenly among the students without any remainder.""

To solve this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 42, 84, and 105 since the number of students must evenly divide each of these quantities.

- The factors of 42 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.
- The factors of 84 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84.
- The factors of 105 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105.

The greatest common divisor of 42, 84, and 105 is 21, which means that the teacher can distribute these items evenly among a group of students if the number of students is a multiple of 21. Since the problem specifies that there are more than 10 students, the smallest possible number of students that satisfies this condition and is greater than 10 is 21 itself.

Therefore, the teacher can distribute the items among 21 students.

""In a school, 42% of the total 50 students in the 5th grade are females. How many male students are there in the class?""

Now, let's solve the problem:
Total number of students = 50
Percentage of female students = 42%
Number of female students = (42/100) * 50 = 21

Since the total number of students is 50, the number of male students can be found by subtracting the number of female students from the total:
Number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students

The problem states that for a two-digit number, when 7 is added to the sum of its digits, the result is three times the digit in the tens place. However, when 18 is subtracted from the number, the digits swap places.

## Step 2: Represent the two-digit number algebraically.
Let's denote the tens digit as ""T"" and the units digit as ""U"". Thus, the two-digit number can be represented as 10T + U.

## Step 3: Formulate the equation based on the given condition about the sum of digits and the tens place digit.
According to the problem, the sum of the digits plus 7 equals three times the tens digit. So, we have: T + U + 7 = 3T.

## Step 4: Simplify the equation from Step 3.
Rearranging the equation to solve for U in terms of T: U + 7 = 3T - T, which simplifies to U + 7 = 2T, and further simplifies to U = 2T - 7.

## Step 5: Formulate the equation for the condition when 18 is subtracted and the digits swap.
When 18 is subtracted from the original number, the digits swap. So, we have: 10T + U - 18 = 10U + T - 18 + 18 (to keep the equation balanced), which simplifies to 10T + U = 10U + T, because the -18 and +18 cancel out.

## Step 6: Simplify the equation from Step 5.
Rearranging the equation gives us: 10T - T = 10U - U, which simplifies to 9T = 9U.

## Step 7: Solve for T and U using the simplified equation from Step 6.
Dividing both sides by 9 gives T = U.

## Step 8: Substitute T = U into the equation from Step 4 to find the value of T and U.
Substituting U for T in U = 2T - 7 gives us U = 2U - 7. Rearranging this equation to solve for U: 7 = 2U - U, which simplifies to 7 = U.

## Step 9: Since T = U, and we found U to be 7"

Translation: 
Sofikul Chacha from Atla village has brought 780 saplings to plant in his land. He decided that the number of saplings in each row will be equal to the number of rows. However, when planting the saplings in this way, he found that 4 saplings were missing. Sofikul Chacha decided to plant the saplings in _____ rows.

Now, let's solve the problem. 
Let's assume the number of rows to be 'x'. Since the number of saplings in each row is equal to the number of rows, the total number of saplings will be x^2. However, we are given that 4 saplings are missing, so the total number of saplings is x^2 - 4 = 780.

We need to find the value of 'x' that satisfies the equation x^2 - 4 = 780.
x^2 = 780 + 4
x^2 = 784
x = √784
x = 28

So, Sofikul Chacha decided to plant the saplings in 28 rows, but since 4 saplings were missing, this number should be a factor of 780 + 4 = 784, and indeed 28^2 = 784.

However, given the information and usual interpretation of such puzzles, it seems there might have been an oversight in considering 784 directly as the square, since the question hints at the arrangement being with a shortage of saplings. Thus, factoring 780 into a square minus 4 might have led directly to identifying the square root without needing to account for the missing saplings in the calculation directly. But since we see 28^2 = 784, which fits the criteria including the shortage, we stick to this figure.

Translation of the problem:
""It takes 1/3 deciliter of paint to paint 3/5 square meters of wall. How many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint?""

Given:
- 3/5 square meters of wall is painted with 1/3 deciliter of paint.

First, we find out how many square meters can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint. Since 1 deciliter = 3 * (1/3) deciliter, we multiply the area that can be painted with 1/3 deciliter by 3 to find the area that can be painted with 1 deciliter.

Area painted with 1/3 deciliter = 3/5 square meters
Area painted with 1 deciliter = 3 * (3/5) square meters = 9/5 square meters

Therefore, with 1 deciliter of paint, 9/5 square meters of wall can be painted.

""The total salary of Farida and Fatema together is 19950 taka. Fatema earns 2450 taka more than Farida. Farida's salary is _____ taka.""

Let's denote Farida's salary as F and Fatema's salary as F + 2450 (since Fatema earns 2450 taka more than Farida).

We know that their total salary is 19950 taka, so we can set up the following equation:

F + (F + 2450) = 19950

Combine like terms:

2F + 2450 = 19950

Subtract 2450 from both sides:

2F = 19950 - 2450
2F = 17500

Divide both sides by 2:

F = 17500 / 2
F = 8750

So, Farida's salary is 8750 taka.

""The product of two positive numbers is 147; the larger number is 3 times the smaller number. The larger number is _____.""

Now, let's denote the smaller number as x. According to the problem, the larger number is 3 times the smaller number, so it can be denoted as 3x. 

We know that their product is 147, so we can write the equation:
x * 3x = 147

This simplifies to:
3x^2 = 147

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
x^2 = 49

Taking the square root of both sides (remembering that x is a positive number) gives:
x = 7

Since the larger number is 3 times the smaller number, the larger number is:
3x = 3 * 7 = 21

Therefore, the larger number is 21.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the farm has 50 horses and 60 cows, making a total of 50 + 60 = 110 animals.

2. Each cow gives birth to 2 calves per year. So, the total number of calves born in a year is 60 * 2 = 120.

3. However, 30% of these calves die due to disease. The number of calves that die is 30% of 120, which is (30/100) * 120 = 36.

4. Therefore, the number of calves that survive is 120 - 36 = 84.

5. After one year, the total number of animals will be the sum of the initial animals (horses and cows) and the new calves that survived. So, the total is 110 (initial animals) + 84 (new calves) = 194.

1. Translation of the problem:
Sajjad Sahib had 24,000 taka. He donated 5/12 of this amount to an orphanage and 3/8 of it to an educational institution. How much did he donate to the educational institution?

2. Solution:
First, let's calculate the amount donated to the orphanage and the educational institution.

Amount donated to the orphanage = (5/12) * 24,000
To find this amount, we multiply 24,000 by 5 and then divide by 12.
= (5 * 24,000) / 12
= 120,000 / 12
= 10,000

Amount donated to the educational institution = (3/8) * 24,000
To find this amount, we multiply 24,000 by 3 and then divide by 8.
= (3 * 24,000) / 8
= 72,000 / 8
= 9,000

Therefore, Sajjad Sahib donated 9,000 taka to the educational institution.

Let's denote Lincoln's share as L. Since Dalim received twice the amount of Lincoln's share, Dalim's share is 2L. 

Sabuj received 3/5 of Dalim's share, which means Sabuj's share is (3/5) * 2L = 6L/5.

The sum of their shares is equal to 6300 rupees. So, we can set up the equation:

L + 2L + 6L/5 = 6300

To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5L + 10L + 6L = 31500

Weight per meter = 13/8 kilograms
Weight of 3/5 meter = (3/5) * (13/8)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
Weight of 3/5 meter = (3 * 13) / (5 * 8)
Weight of 3/5 meter = 39 / 40

So, the weight of 3/5 meter of the pipe is 39/40 kilograms.

1. **Translation of the problem into English:**
The problem states that in a garden, while attempting to plant 1800 saplings in a square pattern, there were 36 extra trees. We need to find out how many saplings are in each row.

2. **Solution:**
Let's denote the number of trees in each row as 'x'. Since the trees are planted in a square pattern, the total number of trees planted in this pattern would be a perfect square. However, we have 1800 trees originally intended for the square pattern, but due to the extra 36 trees, we actually have 1836 trees. 

The closest perfect square to 1800, considering the context of a square arrangement, needs to be found. The total number of trees including the extras is 1836, but for a square pattern, we're interested in the original 1800.

To find 'x', we look for a perfect square that is closest to 1800 but keeps in mind that the total trees planted (including the extra) should help us deduce the correct arrangement:

- The square root of 1800 is approximately 42.43, suggesting that the nearest square numbers below and above 1800 are 42^2 = 1764 and 43^2 = 1849.

Since 1800 trees need to be planted in a square pattern and there are 36 extra trees, making the total 1836, which is closer to 1849 (43^2) than to 1764 (42^2), it indicates the intended square pattern likely involves 43 trees per side. 

Given the information and the error in tree counting (36 extra), the problem suggests an arrangement where each side would have 43 trees for the nearest larger square (43^2 = 1849), accommodating the extra trees as well. However, the question asks for the number of trees per row based on the original intention (1800 trees), but it seems the arrangement was meant to be a square that got slightly altered due to the extra trees.

Thus, considering the provided details and the square pattern's nature, the number of trees per row would be based on"

The work done is constant in this scenario.

Translation of the problem: 
A part of the bank of the Ichamati river takes 35 days for 40 workers to complete. How many workers will it take to complete the same part in 28 days?

Let's denote:
- Total work = W
- Number of workers initially = 40
- Initial time taken = 35 days
- New time taken = 28 days
- New number of workers needed = x

The formula relating work, time, and workers is W = (number of workers) * (time taken). Since the work done (W) remains constant, we can set up a proportion based on the fact that the product of the number of workers and the days to complete the work should be equal in both scenarios.

Therefore, 40 workers * 35 days = x workers * 28 days

This equation can be represented as:
40 * 35 = x * 28

Solving for x gives us:
x = (40 * 35) / 28

x = 1400 / 28
x = 50

So, it will take 50 workers to complete the same amount of work in 28 days.

1. Translate the Bengali problem into English for clarity:
Abdullah draws a line that is 1 meter long. Then he realizes it's a bit long. So, he erases 33 centimeters of it. As a result, the length of the line now is _____ cm.

2. Solve the problem:
First, we need to convert the initial length of the line from meters to centimeters because the erased portion is given in centimeters. Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, the initial length of the line is 100 centimeters.

Abdullah erases 33 centimeters from the line. To find the new length, we subtract the erased portion from the initial length:
Initial length = 100 cm
Erased portion = 33 cm
New length = Initial length - Erased portion = 100 cm - 33 cm = 67 cm

Therefore, the new length of the line is 67 cm.

""5.5 cm radius of a circular cylinder with a height of 8 cm. Determine the entire surface area of the cylinder in square centimeters. (π = 3.14)""

Now, let's break down the solution:

The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is given by:
2 * π * r * (r + h)

where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.

Given:

""Translation: A rectangular field's length is 25 meters more than its width. The perimeter of the rectangular field is 150 meters, what is the length of the field?""

Let's denote the width of the rectangular field as W and the length as L. According to the problem, L = W + 25.

The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W. We are told that the perimeter is 150 meters. So, we can write:

150 = 2L + 2W

Substituting L = W + 25 into the equation:

150 = 2(W + 25) + 2W

Expanding the equation:

150 = 2W + 50 + 2W

Combine like terms:

150 = 4W + 50

Subtract 50 from both sides:

100 = 4W

Divide both sides by 4:

25 = W

Now that we have the width, we can find the length since L = W + 25:

L = 25 + 25 = 50

Therefore, the length of the field is 50 meters.

""One businessman sells 18 kg 300 grams of rice and 5 kg 750 grams of salt on a certain day. According to this account, in a month, he sells _____ kg of salt.""

Now, let's solve the problem. The question asks for the monthly sale of salt, but it provides daily sales of both rice and salt. The daily sale of salt is 5 kg 750 grams, which can be converted into kilograms by adding the grams to the kilograms after converting the grams to kilograms (since 1 kg = 1000 grams).

So, 5 kg 750 grams = 5 + (750/1000) kg = 5 + 0.75 kg = 5.75 kg.

Since the problem asks for the monthly sale, assuming a month has approximately 30 days, the monthly sale of salt would be:

5.75 kg/day * 30 days/month = 172.5 kg/month.

Therefore, the businessman sells approximately 172.5 kg of salt in a month.

1. Principal amount (P) = 200,000 Tk (initial deposit)
2. Rate of interest (R) = 12% per annum
3. Compounding frequency = Semi-annually (every 6 months)
4. Time period (n) = 6 months (0.5 years for the first calculation, but since it's compounded semi-annually, we consider it as 1 period)

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
Where:
- \(A\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \(P\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \(R\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \(n\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \(t\) is the time the money is invested for in years.

However, since we are looking to find the interest accrued after the first 6 months, we can simplify the calculation:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{2}\right) \]
Given that \(R = 12\% = 0.12\) and \(n = 2\) (since the interest is compounded semi-annually), 
\[ A = 200,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right) \]
\[ A = 200,000 \left(1 + 0.06\right) \]
\[ A = 200,000 \times 1.06 \]
\[ A = 212,000 \]

The interest earned (I) after 6 months is the difference between the amount (A) and the principal (P):
\[ I = A - P \]
\[ I = 212,000 - 200,000 \]
\[ I = 12,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of interest that will be accrued in the society's account after 6 months is 12,000 Tk.

""Translation: The product of two positive square numbers is 1576 and the ratio of the larger number to the smaller number is 9/7. The smaller number is _____.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- The product of two numbers is 1576.
- The ratio of the larger number to the smaller number is 9/7.

Let's denote the smaller number as \(x\) and the larger number as \(y\). According to the given ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{y}{x} = \frac{9}{7} \]

From the ratio, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[ y = \frac{9}{7}x \]

We also know that the product of these two numbers is 1576:
\[ xy = 1576 \]

Substituting \(y = \frac{9}{7}x\) into the equation, we get:
\[ x \cdot \frac{9}{7}x = 1576 \]
\[ \frac{9}{7}x^2 = 1576 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{1576 \cdot 7}{9} \]
\[ x^2 = 1228 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{1228} \]
\[ x = \sqrt{4 \cdot 307} \]
\[ x = 2\sqrt{307} \]

However, we are looking for a square number, and it seems there was a mistake in simplifying the square root of 1228 directly to an integer or a simple square number. Let's correct that and follow the problem's logic more accurately.

Given that both numbers are positive square numbers, let's correctly find them using the given conditions without immediately jumping into square roots.

The product of the two numbers is 1576, and their ratio is 9/7. This implies:
\[ y = \frac{9}{7}x \]
\[ xy = 1576 \]
Substituting \(y\) gives:
\[ x \cdot \frac{9}{7}x = 1576 \]
\[ \frac{9x^2}{7} = 1576 \]
\[ 9x^2 = 1576 \cdot 7 \]
\[ 9x^2 = 11032 \]

Now, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the current age of the Banyan tree be B and the current age of the Pine tree be P.
2. We know that P = 1432 years.
3. 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. So, (B - 150) + (P - 150) = 2961.
4. Substituting P = 1432 into the equation, we get (B - 150) + (1432 - 150) = 2961.
5. Simplifying, we get B - 150 + 1282 = 2961, which gives B - 150 = 1679.
6. Solving for B, we get B = 1829.
7. Now, we need to find the sum of their ages 200 years from now. So, (B + 200) + (P + 200) = (1829 + 200) + (1432 + 200).

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the total length of the stick be L meters.
2. The part above the water is 2 meters, which is the remaining part after subtracting the parts in the ground and water from the total length.
3. The part in the ground is 1/6 of L, and the part in water is 1/2 of L.
4. So, the equation becomes: L = (1/6)L + (1/2)L + 2
5. To find the common denominator, we multiply the fractions to get: L = (1/6)L + (3/6)L + 2
6. Combining like terms, we get: L = (4/6)L + 2
7. Simplifying further, we get: L = (2/3)L + 2

1. Translation of the problem: The ratio of the three angles of a right-angled isosceles triangle will be _______.

In a right-angled isosceles triangle, two sides are equal in length, and one angle is 90 degrees. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and one angle is 90 degrees, the sum of the remaining two angles must be 90 degrees. Because the triangle is isosceles, the two remaining angles must be equal. 

Therefore, each of the two base angles is 45 degrees (since 90 degrees / 2 = 45 degrees). 

So, the ratio of the angles in the triangle is 45:45:90, which simplifies to 1:1:2.

""Translation: The length of a rectangular land is three times its width, and the perimeter of the land is 40 meters. The width of the land is _____ meters.""

Let's denote the width of the land as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is three times the width, so we can write L = 3W.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by P = 2L + 2W. We are told that the perimeter is 40 meters, so we can set up the equation as follows:

40 = 2L + 2W

Substituting L = 3W into the equation, we get:

40 = 2(3W) + 2W
40 = 6W + 2W
40 = 8W

To find the width (W), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

W = 40 / 8
W = 5

Therefore, the width of the land is 5 meters.

""The price of rice was 1080 taka per quintal when the crop was about to be harvested. The price of rice increased by 15% during the rainy season. If a farmer sold 12 quintals of rice when the crop was about to be harvested, he would have gotten _____ taka more if he had sold the same amount of rice during the rainy season.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

Initial price per quintal = 1080 taka
Initial total amount for 12 quintals = 12 * 1080 = 12960 taka

The price increases by 15% during the rainy season. To find the new price, we calculate:
New price per quintal = 1080 + (15% of 1080)
= 1080 + (0.15 * 1080)
= 1080 + 162
= 1242 taka per quintal

New total amount for 12 quintals = 12 * 1242 = 14904 taka

The difference in the amount received during the rainy season and the initial amount is:
Difference = New total amount - Initial total amount
= 14904 - 12960
= 1944 taka

Therefore, the farmer would have gotten 1944 taka more if he had sold the same amount of rice during the rainy season.

""The smallest number that when subtracted from 5834 results in a difference that is divisible by 20, 28, 32, and 35.""

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 28, 32, and 35, since the result of the subtraction should be divisible by all these numbers.

The LCM of 20, 28, 32, and 35 is calculated as follows:
- The prime factorization of these numbers are:
  - 20 = 2^2 * 5
  - 28 = 2^2 * 7
  - 32 = 2^5
  - 35 = 5 * 7
- The LCM must include the highest powers of these primes found in the factorizations:
  - Highest power of 2: 2^5 (from 32)
  - Highest power of 5: 5 (from 20 and 35)
  - Highest power of 7: 7 (from 28 and 35)
- Thus, the LCM = 2^5 * 5 * 7 = 32 * 5 * 7 = 1120.

Now, we need to find the smallest number that when subtracted from 5834 gives a result that is divisible by 1120. To do this, we divide 5834 by 1120 and look for the remainder.

5834 / 1120 ≈ 5.21, which means 5834 divided by 1120 gives a quotient of 5 with a remainder. To find the remainder:
5834 - (1120 * 5) = 5834 - 5600 = 234.

So, the number to be subtracted from 5834 to make it divisible by 1120 (and hence by 20, 28, 32, and 35) is 234, since 5834 - 234 = 5600, which is divisible by 1120.

Now, let's solve the problem:

To pay 190 rupees using the minimum number of notes, Abir should prioritize using the largest denomination notes first, which are the 50-rupee notes. 

1. Using 50-rupee notes: 190 / 50 = 3 with a remainder of 40. So, Abir can use 3 fifty-rupee notes to pay 150 rupees (3 * 50 = 150), leaving 40 rupees remaining to be paid.

2. For the remaining 40 rupees, Abir can use 2 twenty-rupee notes (2 * 20 = 40), which exactly covers the remaining amount.

Therefore, Abir needs 3 fifty-rupee notes and 2 twenty-rupee notes to pay 190 rupees, which totals 5 notes.

""Translation: A rectangular land's length is three times its width, and the land's perimeter is 40 meters. The land's length is _____ meters.""

Now, let's proceed to solve the problem. 

Let's denote the width of the rectangular land as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is three times the width, so we can write:
L = 3W

The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
P = 2L + 2W

We know the perimeter is 40 meters, so we substitute L = 3W into the perimeter formula:
40 = 2(3W) + 2W
40 = 6W + 2W
40 = 8W

Now, we solve for W:
W = 40 / 8
W = 5

Since L = 3W, we can now find the length:
L = 3 * 5
L = 15

Therefore, the length of the land is 15 meters.

Translation of the problem: ""The largest four-digit perfect square number is _____.""

Now, let's proceed to solve it. A four-digit number ranges from 1000 to 9999. We need to find the largest perfect square that falls within this range.

The largest four-digit number is 9999. We need to find the square root of 9999 to determine the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to 9999.

The square root of 9999 is approximately 99.99. This means the largest integer whose square is less than 9999 is 99, because 99^2 = 9801, which is a four-digit number.

However, we should check if there's a larger perfect square less than 9999 by squaring the next integer after 99, which is 100. 

100^2 = 10000, which exceeds the four-digit range (it's a five-digit number).

Therefore, the largest four-digit perfect square number is indeed 99^2 = 9801.

""Find the largest number that when 2300 and 3500 are divided by it, the remainders are 32 and 56, respectively.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the largest number be x.
2. According to the problem, 2300 = qx + 32 and 3500 = rx + 56, where q and r are quotients.
3. We can rewrite the equations as 2300 - 32 = qx and 3500 - 56 = rx.
4. Simplifying the equations, we get 2268 = qx and 3444 = rx.
5. Now, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2268 and 3444, which will be the largest number x.

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

1. Divide 3444 by 2268: 3444 = 1 * 2268 + 1176
2. Divide 2268 by 1176: 2268 = 1 * 1176 + 1092
3. Divide 1176 by 1092: 1176 = 1 * 1092 + 84
4. Divide 1092 by 84: 1092 = 13 * 84 + 0

The GCD of 2268 and 3444 is 84.

Therefore, the largest number x is 84 + 32 = 116 (for 2300) and 84 + 56 = 140 (for 3500), but since we need the same divisor for both, the correct interpretation is to find a number that satisfies both conditions, which is actually looking for the difference in remainders and relating it to the divisor, hence the number should directly relate to the difference in the remainders when divided, hence 84 is the largest number that when 2300 and 3500 are divided by it, it gives the remainders mentioned.

Translation: In a cricket match, the total number of runs scored by Imran and Sumon is 58. Imran's runs are 5 less than twice the number of runs scored by Sumon. The number of runs scored by Imran in that match is _____.

Let's denote Imran's runs as I and Sumon's runs as S. According to the problem, the total runs scored by both is 58, so we have:
I + S = 58

It's also given that Imran's runs are 5 less than twice the number of runs scored by Sumon, which can be written as:
I = 2S - 5

Substituting the value of I from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
2S - 5 + S = 58

Combining like terms, we have:
3S - 5 = 58

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives us:
3S = 63

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
S = 21

Now, to find Imran's runs (I), we substitute the value of S back into one of the original equations. Using I = 2S - 5:
I = 2(21) - 5
I = 42 - 5
I = 37

Therefore, Imran scored 37 runs in the match.

The problem states that in a park, there is a banyan tree and a pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the two trees was 2961 years. Currently, the age of the pine tree is 1432 years. We need to find the age of the banyan tree 200 years from now.

## Step 2: Calculate the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago.
Let's denote the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago as B and the age of the pine tree 150 years ago as P. We know that B + P = 2961.

## Step 3: Calculate the current age of the pine tree and its age 150 years ago.
The current age of the pine tree is given as 1432 years. So, 150 years ago, the age of the pine tree was 1432 - 150 = 1282 years.

## Step 4: Use the information from step 2 and step 3 to find the age of the banyan tree 150 years ago.
Substitute the value of P from step 3 into the equation from step 2: B + 1282 = 2961. Solve for B: B = 2961 - 1282 = 1679 years.

## Step 5: Calculate the current age of the banyan tree.
Since 150 years have passed, the current age of the banyan tree is 1679 + 150 = 1829 years.

## Step 6: Calculate the age of the banyan tree 200 years from now.
To find the age of the banyan tree 200 years from now, add 200 to its current age: 1829 + 200 = 2029 years.

The length of the floor of a room is 4 meters and the width is 3.5 meters. The room is 3 meters high and its walls are 15 cm thick, then the volume of the four walls is _____ cubic meters.

First, convert the thickness from centimeters to meters since the other measurements are in meters:
15 cm = 0.15 meters (since 1 meter = 100 cm)

Now, calculate the area of the four walls. There are two longer walls and two shorter walls:
- The area of the two longer walls = 2 * length * height = 2 * 4 * 3 = 24 square meters
- The area of the two shorter walls = 2 * width * height = 2 * 3.5 * 3 = 21 square meters
Total area of the four walls = 24 + 21 = 45 square meters

However, to find the volume of the walls, we consider the thickness:
Volume of the walls = Total area of the four walls * thickness = 45 * 0.15

Calculating the volume:

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

First, let's calculate the interest earned on Rs. 6500 in 4 years:
Interest = Rs. 8840 - Rs. 6500 = Rs. 2340

Since the interest is earned over 4 years, we can calculate the annual interest rate. However, we don't need to explicitly calculate the interest rate, as we can use the proportionality of the amounts to find the answer.

Let's denote the unknown amount as x. Since the interest earned is proportional to the principal amount, we can set up a proportion:

(6500 / 8840) = (x / 10200)

We can cross-multiply and solve for x:
6500 * 10200 = 8840 * x
66300000 = 8840x
x = 66300000 / 8840
x = 7500

""The number closest to 98765 that is divisible by 28, 33, 42, and 77 is _______.""

To solve this problem, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 28, 33, 42, and 77, as the number we are looking for must be divisible by all these numbers.

1. Find the prime factors of each number:
   - 28 = 2^2 * 7
   - 33 = 3 * 11
   - 42 = 2 * 3 * 7
   - 77 = 7 * 11

2. Calculate the LCM using the highest powers of all prime numbers found:
   - The prime factors involved are 2, 3, 7, and 11.
   - The highest power of 2 is 2^2 (from 28).
   - The highest power of 3 is 3^1 (from 33 and 42).
   - The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 28, 42, and 77).
   - The highest power of 11 is 11^1 (from 33 and 77).
   - Therefore, the LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 7 * 11 = 4 * 3 * 7 * 11 = 924.

3. Now, we need to find the multiple of 924 that is closest to 98765.
   - Divide 98765 by 924 to find the nearest whole number multiple:
     98765 / 924 ≈ 106.85
   - The closest whole number multiples of 924 to 98765 are 924 * 106 = 97944 and 924 * 107 = 98868.
   - Between these two, 98868 is closer to 98765 than 97944.

Therefore, the number closest to 98765 that is divisible by 28, 33, 42, and 77 is 98868.

Translation: If a certain amount of land produces 20 kg 850 grams of mustard on a particular day, then how many kilograms of mustard will be produced in total from 7 such pieces of land.

Now, let's break down the given amount of mustard produced from one piece of land into kilograms. We have 20 kg and 850 grams. Since 1 kg = 1000 grams, 850 grams is 0.85 kg (because 850/1000 = 0.85). Therefore, the total amount of mustard from one piece of land is 20 kg + 0.85 kg = 20.85 kg.

If one piece of land produces 20.85 kg of mustard, then 7 such pieces of land will produce 7 * 20.85 kg of mustard. 

7 * 20.85 = 145.95 kg.

So, 7 pieces of land will produce a total of 145.95 kg of mustard.

""An shopkeeper buys eggs at 25 taka per dozen and sells them at 56 taka per 2 dozen, what will be his percentage profit?""

Now, let's calculate the cost price (CP) and selling price (SP) to determine the profit percentage.

1. Cost Price (CP) per dozen eggs = 25 taka
2. Selling Price (SP) per 2 dozen eggs = 56 taka
   - So, SP per dozen eggs = 56 / 2 = 28 taka

Profit per dozen eggs = SP - CP = 28 - 25 = 3 taka

Profit percentage = (Profit / CP) * 100
                  = (3 / 25) * 100

1. **Translation of the Problem:**
The problem states that a tea businessman buys a box of tea leaves at a rate of 80 Taka per kilogram and sells all the tea leaves at a rate of 75 Taka per kilogram, resulting in a loss of 500 Taka. We need to find out how many kilograms of tea leaves he bought.

2. **Mathematical Reasoning:**
Let's denote the total number of kilograms of tea leaves purchased as \(x\) kg.

The cost price (CP) of \(x\) kg of tea leaves at 80 Taka per kg is \(80x\) Taka.

The selling price (SP) of \(x\) kg of tea leaves at 75 Taka per kg is \(75x\) Taka.

Given that the loss incurred is 500 Taka, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Loss} = \text{CP} - \text{SP} \]
\[ 500 = 80x - 75x \]
\[ 500 = 5x \]
\[ x = \frac{500}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, the tea businessman bought 100 kilograms of tea leaves.

""Raju and Roni together have 690 litchis. Roni has 86 litchis less than Raju. Raju has _____ litchis.""

Let's denote the number of litchis Raju has as R and the number Roni has as N. We know that:
1. R + N = 690 (Together they have 690 litchis)
2. N = R - 86 (Roni has 86 litchis less than Raju)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to find R:
R + (R - 86) = 690
2R - 86 = 690
2R = 690 + 86
2R = 776
R = 776 / 2
R = 388

Therefore, Raju has 388 litchis.

""Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln are three brothers. Their father distributed 6300 rupees among them. Sabuj received 3/5 of Dalim's share, and Dalim received twice the amount of Lincoln. What is the amount of money Dalim received?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step. 

Let's assume Lincoln's share is x. Then, Dalim's share would be 2x, and Sabuj's share would be (3/5) * 2x = 6x/5.

We know that the total amount distributed is 6300 rupees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 6x/5 = 6300

Combine like terms:

(5x + 10x + 6x) / 5 = 6300

21x / 5 = 6300

Multiply both sides by 5:

21x = 31500

Divide both sides by 21:

x = 1500

Now that we know Lincoln's share (x) is 1500, we can find Dalim's share:

Dalim's share = 2x = 2 * 1500 = 3000

Therefore, Dalim received 3000 rupees.

Now, let's break down the given amount in taka into a numerical value:
Seventy-nine million = 79,000,000
Thirty-three thousand = 33,000
One hundred = 100
Total amount in taka = 79,000,000 + 33,000 + 100 = 79,033,100 taka

Given that 1 dollar = 100 taka, we can convert the total amount in taka to dollars:
Amount in dollars = Total amount in taka / 100

Translation: A bamboo stick is 2 meters long, and 75 cm of its length is painted red. The rest of the length is painted white. What will be the ratio of the total length of the bamboo stick to the length painted red?

Now, let's solve the problem. 

First, we convert the total length of the bamboo stick into centimeters because the length painted red is given in centimeters. 
1 meter = 100 cm, so 2 meters = 200 cm.

The length of the bamboo stick painted red = 75 cm.

The length of the bamboo stick not painted red (painted white) = Total length - Length painted red
= 200 cm - 75 cm
= 125 cm.

However, we are asked for the ratio of the total length of the bamboo to the length painted red, not the length painted white. 

So, the ratio of the total length to the length painted red = Total length : Length painted red
= 200 cm : 75 cm.

To simplify this ratio, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 200 and 75. 
The GCD of 200 and 75 is 25.

Now, we divide both parts of the ratio by 25:
= (200 / 25) : (75 / 25)
= 8 : 3.

Therefore, the ratio of the total length of the bamboo stick to the length painted red is 8:3.

22% of x = 1870

Where x is Anil Babu's monthly income.

To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.22x = 1870

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.22:

x = 1870 / 0.22
x = 8500

So, Anil Babu's monthly income is 8500 rupees.

Now, let's break down the problem and solve it:

1. Each window has 2 shutters.
2. There are 2 windows in total.
3. So, the total number of shutters to be painted is 2 (windows) * 2 (shutters/window) = 4 shutters.
4. It takes 2 hours and 15 minutes to paint each shutter.
5. We need to convert 2 hours and 15 minutes into just hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.
6. So, the time to paint one shutter is 2 hours + 0.25 hours = 2.25 hours.
7. To paint all 4 shutters, it will take 4 * 2.25 hours = 9 hours.

Therefore, Debu Babu will need 9 hours to paint the two windows.

Given:
- ক : খ = ৪ : ৭ (K : Kh = 4 : 7)
- খ : গ = ১০ : ৭ (Kh : G = 10 : 7)

First, let's translate the given problem into English for clarity:
""The ratio of K to Kh is 4:7, and the ratio of Kh to G is 10:7. Find the ratio of K to Kh to G.""

To find the ratio of K : Kh : G, we need to make the ratios of Kh consistent in both given ratios.

From ক : খ = ৪ : ৭, we can say Kh = 7x and K = 4x, where x is a multiplier.

From খ : গ = ১০ : ৭, to make Kh = 7x consistent with the first ratio, we adjust the second ratio by finding a common multiple for Kh. Since 7x is the common term, we can directly use the second ratio as is because it already matches in terms of Kh's multiplier. Thus, Kh = 10y and G = 7y, where y is another multiplier.

To match the Kh in both ratios, we need to equate 7x = 10y. For simplicity, let's choose x and y such that this equation holds true. If we let x = 10 and y = 7, then:
- 7x = 7 * 10 = 70
- 10y = 10 * 7 = 70

So, Kh = 70.

Now, using the values of x and y:
- K = 4x = 4 * 10 = 40
- Kh = 70 (as found)
- G = 7y = 7 * 7 = 49

Thus, the ratio K : Kh : G = 40 : 70 : 49.

To simplify this ratio, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40, 70, and 49, which is 1 (since they do not share common factors other than 1), meaning the ratio is already in its simplest form in terms of whole numbers, but for"

Now, let's solve the problem:

Let the cost price (CP) of the car be $100.
Given that the selling price (SP) is 45% of the cost price, we can calculate SP as follows:
SP = 45% of CP = 0.45 * $100 = $45

Since SP < CP, there is a loss.
To calculate the percentage loss:
Loss = CP - SP = $100 - $45 = $55
Percentage loss = (Loss / CP) * 100 = ($55 / $100) * 100 = 55%

Therefore, the car incurs a 55% loss.

""The profit for a certain period of time is 5600 rupees, and the profit is 2/5 of the principal amount. The annual interest rate is 8%.""

Now, let's break it down step by step:

Let the principal amount be P, and the time period be T years.

Given that the profit is 2/5 of the principal amount, we can write:
Profit = (2/5)P

We are also given that the profit is 5600 rupees, so:
(2/5)P = 5600

Multiplying both sides by 5/2:
P = 5600 * (5/2)
P = 14000

Now, we know that the annual interest rate is 8%, and the profit is 5600 rupees. We can use the formula:
Profit = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

Substituting the values:
5600 = (14000 * 8 * T) / 100

Simplifying:
5600 = (1120 * T) / 10
5600 = 112 * T
T = 5600 / 112
T = 50

Therefore, the time period is 50 years, but since the profit is for a certain period, the time must be in a fraction of a year to satisfy the given conditions, but the question was actually asking for time, which we calculated as 50, and principal was given as a relation to the profit, hence the actual question was related to time.
