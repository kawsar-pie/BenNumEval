638,"কোনো প্রকৃত ভগ্নাংশের লব ও হরের যোগফল ১৪ এবং বিয়োগফল ৮ হলে, ভগ্নাংশটি নির্ণয় কর।",৩/১১,"1. First, let's translate the problem from Bengali to English for clarity. The problem states that the sum of the numerator and denominator of a proper fraction is 14, and their difference is 8. We need to find this fraction.

2. Let the numerator be x and the denominator be y. According to the problem, we have two equations:

x + y = 14
   x - y = 8

3. To solve for x and y, we can add these two equations together (since they have the same unknowns):

(x + y) + (x - y) = 14 + 8
   2x = 22

4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

2x / 2 = 22 / 2
   x = 11

5. Substitute x = 11 into one of the original equations (let's use x + y = 14):

11 + y = 14

6. Solve for y:

y = 14 - 11
   y = 3

7. The fraction is represented as x/y. Substitute the values of x and y we found:

Fraction = x / y = 11 / 3

8. This fraction cannot be simplified further, so our final answer is a mixed number:

""Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of numbers 145 and 232.""

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in Chinese, following the logical flow of reasoning:

First, we find the prime factors for each number and determine their commonalities;

145 = 5 \* 7 \* 2 (prime factors)
232 = 8 \* 16 (prime factors)

Next, we observe if any of these factor(s) are common between both numbers. In this case, there's no single prime factor that is common to both 145 and 232; therefore, either number itself is not divisible by the GCD.

Now, let's calculate each number until one reaches a divisor for the other number. We see that:

145 / 5 = 29 (divisor for 232)
232 / 29 = 8

So, our division indicates that GCD(145, 232) is 29 since it is the divisor of both numbers. Thus, we have found the Greatest Common Divisor, which was requested in the problem statement.

The problem involves determining the largest number among three positive numbers given their paired products, which are 24, 48, and 32 respectively.

2. Let's denote the three numbers as A, B, and C with A > B > C > 0. We have the equations:
    - AB = 24 (Equation 1)
    - BC = 48 (Equation 2)
    - AC = 32 (Equation 3)

3. To eliminate one variable and solve for the other, we can divide Equation 1 by Equation 2, which yields B:
    B = 24 / 48 = 0.5

4. Substituting B into Equation 1, we find A:
    AB = 24 => A * 0.5 = 24 => A = 48

5. Now that we have values for A and B, we substitute them back into Equation 3 to solve for C:
    AC = 32 => (48)C = 32 => C = 0.67 (not a whole number, as the question assumes A, B, and C are integers; thus, this solution is incorrect under our initial assumption of the numbers being positive integers)

6. We should verify it as positive integers by trial and error:
    Let's check 1*24 = 24 with a second number that when multiplied by a third number gives us 32 (A<B). 1x48 cannot be correct because A should be the biggest number. So, we try A=8, B=3, and C=4. Let's check:

    - BC = 3*4 = 12, not equal to 48 (wrong). Re-trying again, C=8 then BC=48 => B=6 is wrong since 6x6=36. Therefore:

The area of a triangular field is 264 square meters. If one of its height (bh’umis) is 22 meters, calculate the altitude/height.

2. Solution process:

Area of a triangle = 1/2 * base * height
We are given the area and the base (which we'll call 'a' = a side). Let's denote the height as 'h'. We can rearrange our formula to find 'h'.

So, h = (2 * Area) / base
We know that:
Area = 264 m^2
base = a = 22 meters

Substituting known values in the equation yields:

h = (2 * 264)/ 22
h = (528)/ 22
h = 24

2. A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as the product of some integer and itself. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it equals 2*2; 9 is a perfect square equals to 3*3; etc. In the decimal number system, the squares start with 0, then 1, 4, 9, 16, 25... and so on.

3. If we denote the smallest integer needed to make the sum a perfect square as 'n', then:

   5320 + n = m^2
   
   where 'm' is an integer.

4. To find 'n', we need to know what value of 'm^2' will be just enough for 5320+ 'n'.

5. Since the smallest integer for 'm' when 5320 is 72 (as m^2 must be greater or equal to 5320) we can set up the equation:
   
   5320 + n = 73^2

6. Solving this equation will give us the smallest integer 'n':

   n = 73^2 - 5320
   n = 5329 - 5320

The garden of Nisar has 441 orange trees. Many of these oranges are to be picked and kept in baskets. How can we find how many oranges should be placed in each basket so that the total number of baskets used is calculated?
2. Provide a detailed solution with translation:
To solve this problem, let's denote the number of oranges initially set aside as x and the number of baskets required to hold all 441 oranges after setting them apart. We'll use simple division to find out how many baskets are needed.

Step 1: Understand that x is the number of lemons (oranges) distributed into baskets.

Step 2: Set up an equation: Since we want all oranges to be in the baskets, and x of them go in each basket to form the number of baskets needed, we will use integer division to divide the total number of oranges by the number per basket.
\[ 441 \div x = Number\ of\ baskets \]

Step 3: We are given that there is only one possible solution where \(x\) results exactly in an integer division of 441, without any leftover oranges. Thus, the appropriate value for \(x\) needs to be found through calculation.

Step 4: Perform trial calculations by trying different values of x (such as 7, 9, 21, etc.) and find an even number that fits perfectly into the total without leaving a remainder. This ensures the distribution is simple without the need for mixed numbers or additional baskets.

Step 5: The final step involves verifying if our calculated \(x\) value works with the initial equation. If we have found valid x, then \( x = Number\ of\ oranges\ per\ basket \).

Answer: **[num]** is missing due to lack of numerical values for x. Let's assume we follow through and correctly calculate and verify an integer value for \(x\) to reach a final correct answer.","model='mathstral' created_at='2025-02-10T12:42:14.680436669Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=10778780554 load_duration=7087085 prompt_eval_count=346 prompt_eval_duration=67000000 eval_count=467 eval_duration=10703000000 message=Message(role='assistant', content=""1.

If each square meter costs 7.25 taka to pave, what is the total cost to pave that path?

2. Solution Steps: To find the cost, we first need the area of the path. Let's break it down in steps:
    - The total length of the path is 80 meters.
    - The total width is 60 meters.
    - However, there are four corners that have been covered twice (once for length and once for width). To avoid double counting these areas, we need to subtract the areas of the four corner squares.
    - Calculation: Area of the path = Total area in meters² - Area of the 4 corner squares.
    - Each corner square has an area of (4m × 4m = 16m²).
    - So, Area of all corners is 16m² × 4 = 64m².
    - Therefore, the Path's area in meters² = [(80 * 2) + (60 * 2)] - 64 = 192m² - 64m² = 128m².

2. Solution: Let's denote the number of glasses each friend brings as G, and since each friend carries twice as many biscuits as glasses, then each friend brings 2G biscuits. We know that each friend carries a total of 3G items (G glasses + 2G biscuits). The total number of items is given as 147, so we can set up the equation:

Number of friends * Items per person = Total items
N * 3G = 147

To find the number of friends (N), we need to determine the number of glasses and biscuits each friend brings. If we consider that G could be either 1, 2, 3, etc., we can test out different values until our calculation gives us a whole number for N:

If G = 1, then N * 3(1) = 147 => N * 3 = 147 => N = 49 (this means there are 49 friends). Since the glasses and biscuits are in integer amounts, this solution works.

2. Let's denote the price of one sheet of paper as x and the price of one pencil as y. We are given two equations based on the purchases:

Equation 1: 15x + 10y = 300 (from the first boy's purchase)
   Equation 2: 10x + 15y = 250 (from the second boy's purchase)

We now need to solve this system of linear equations to find the values of x and y.

Multiplied Equation 2 by 3/2 to make the coefficients of x equal in both equations:
   New Equation 2: 30x + 45y = 750

Subtracting Equation 1 from the new Equation 2, we get:
   30x - 15x + 45y - 10y = 750 - 300
   15x + 35y = 450 (Equation 3)

Now multiply both sides of Equation 1 by 7 to make the coefficients of y equal in both equations:

We want to divide 0.6 liters of milk evenly among three students. Determine how much milk each student will get.

2. Step-by-step solution:
To find out how much milk each student receives, we need to divide the total amount of milk by the number of students. This can be expressed as an equation: Dividend (Total Amount) / Divisor (Number of Students).

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Dividend = Total Amount of Milk = 0.6 liters
Divisor = Number of Students = 3

Milk per student = Dividend / Divisor
= 0.6/3

""The selling price of a car is equal to 45 percent of its purchasing price. Determine the percentage of profit or loss.""
   Alternatively, it could be translated as ""The car sells for 45% of what it costs to buy, find the percentage gain or loss"".

2. Solution with step-by-step explanation in English:
Let's denote the cost price of the car as $C$. According to the problem statement, the selling price of the car is equal to 45% of its cost price. This means that:
Selling Price = 0.45 * C

To find the percentage gain or loss over the cost price, we need to compare this selling price with the original cost price.

1. Profit Case: If selling price results in a profit, then we can set up the equation like this:
Selling Price > Cost Price
0.45 * C > C
Subtracting C from both sides:
0.45C - C > 0
-0.55 * C > 0 (or simply multiplying through by -1)
0.55 * C < 0

This scenario indicates that there is a loss and cannot be an profit one. Therefore we discard this case now and move on to the loss case with the above selling price of less than cost.

2. Loss Case: We know from the initial condition that Selling Price equals Cost price times 45%, then C - SP gives us the amount it falls short, what is percentage of this gap against total Cost C is loss %:
Loss = Cost - Selling Price)
Since, Selling price is lower then cost at all given case. Therefore :
Loss % = ( (1- 045)C) /C ) x 100% <br>
Loss % = 0.25 x 100% <br>
Hence, Loss% = 25%

There is a loss and its in the calculation not profit, therefore no further calculating needed hence simply say, Selling for 45% cost shows clear 25% loss over original price paid.

3. Conclusion:

Let x be your current age and y be your brother's current age. We know from the problem statement that the ratio of your ages is given by:
x / y = 5 / 6
We are also given that x = 10 years, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

The problem states that there are two roads with a width of 1.5 meters each, intersecting within a field that is 40 meters long and 30 meters wide. We need to calculate the total area of these roads.

2. First, let's find the width of each part of the roads as they are cutting the field in two equal parts. Since the total width of the field is 30 meters, each part will be 30/2 = 15 meters wide.

3. Now, we can calculate the area of each part of the road using the formula: Area = Length * Width. For one part of the road, it would be: Area = 40 * 1.5 = 60 square meters.

4. Since there are two roads at this width, and they intersect within the field in such a way that each part of the field's center is bisected by these roads, we have to calculate the area for both parts. So, Total Area = 60 * 2 = 120 square meters.

To find the height of a triangle when we know its area and the length of one side, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: A = (base × height) / 2. We are given the area (A) as 216 square meters and the base (b) as 18 meters. Our goal is to find the height (h).
Let's rearrange the formula to solve for h:
A = (b × h) / 2
216 = (18 × h) / 2
To isolate h, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 2 and then divide by 18.
(2 × 216) = 18 × h
432 = 18 × h
h = 432 / 18
h = 24 meters

""If 8 liters of milk are divided equally among 5 people, how many liters of milk does each person receive?""

2. Solution Steps:
   - Total amount of milk = 8 liters
   - Number of people = 5
   To find out how much milk each person receives, we need to divide the total amount of milk by the number of people. This can be expressed as:
   Milk per person = Total milk / Number of people
   Substituting the given values, we get:
   Milk per person = 8 liters / 5 people

   We cannot simplify this further without additional information and since the value of each individual's portion is not a whole number or any common fraction, it indicates the division does not result in an equal distribution. Therefore, 8 liters milk divided by 5 people results in each person receiving 1.6 liters of milk.

""A job J can be done by two workers A and B together in 16 days, B and C together in 12 days, and C and A together in 20 days. How many days will A, B, and C take to complete job J together?""

2. To solve this problem, we need to find the rates of work for each pair of workers and then combine these rates to find the rate at which all three can work together.

Let's denote:
A = work done by worker A in one day (1/days)
B = work done by worker B in one day (1/days)
C = work done by worker C in one day (1/days)

From the given information, we have:
(A + B) * 16 = 1 J
(B + C) * 12 = 1 J
(C + A) * 20 = 1 J

This translates to:
A + B = 1/16
B + C = 1/12
C + A = 1/20

Adding these three equations, we get:
2(A + B + C) = 1/16 + 1/12 + 1/20

To solve further, we need to find the common denominator and add these fractions together. The least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 12, and 20 is 480.

So, our equation becomes:
2(A + B + C) = 30/480 + 40/480 + 24/480
2(A + B + C) = 94/480

Now divide both sides by 2 to get the combined work rate of A, B, and C:
A + B + C = 94/960 = 1/10

This means that A, B, and C together can complete 1/10 of job J in one day. To find out how many days they would take to complete the entire job J, we take the reciprocal of their combined work rate (1/(1/10)):

""If the annual rate of return is 10.5%, what will be the profit from an investment of 2000 takas for a period of 5 years?""

2. Detailed Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for calculating the compound interest or compound growth when the interest rate is given annually. The general formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times interest applies per unit t.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

However, since it's mentioned that the rate is an annual rate, we assume that 'n' equals 1, simplifying our formula to:

A = P(1 + r)^t

Where:
- P is 2000 takas (the initial investment).
- r is 10.5% per year or 0.105 as a decimal.
- t is 5 years.

3. Substitute the values into our formula:
A = 2000(1 + 0.105)^5

4. Calculate the value inside the parentheses:
= 2000(1.105)^5

5. Raise 1.105 to the power of 5:
= 2000 * 1.6334 (approximately, as the square is 1.105 to the fifth power doesn't result in an exact number)

6. Multiply to get the total amount after 5 years:
= 3266.8 Takas

7. However, we are looking for the profit, which is revenue minus initial investment:
Profit = Total Amount - Initial Investment

    ""I am looking for the smallest number that is divisible by 6, 8, 10, and 12 within the range between 300 and 500.""

2. Detailed Solution with Steps and Explanation:
   - To find a number that is divisible by many different numbers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of those divisors.
   - The prime factorization of each number is as follows:
     - 6 = $2 * 3$
     - 8 = $2^3$
     - 10 = $2 * 5$
     - 12 = $2^2 * 3$
   - The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes appearing in any factorizations:
     - For 2, the highest power is $2^3$ (from 8).
     - For 3, the highest power is 3.
     - For 5, the highest power is 5.
   - Therefore, LCM = $2^3 * 3 * 5 = 120$.
   
  Now we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 120 and lies between 300 and 500:
     Let's try multiples of 120:
   - Multiple of 120: $120 * 2 = 240$ (too small)
   - The next multiple of 120 within the range we want: $120 * 3 = 360$.

So, the smallest number greater than 300 and divisible by 6, 8, 10, and 12 is 360.

""A car engine has a front wheel with a circumference of 14 decimeters and a rear wheel with a circumference of 35 decimeters. How many times must these two wheels turn at least to completely revolve around each other, taking into account whole numbers?""

2. Detailed step-by-step solution:
To solve this problem, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the circumferences of both wheels as they rotate together. The smallest path that allows both wheels to revolve completely around each other is when the Least Common Multiple of their respective circumferences (rotations) occurs.

1. We have two wheel circumferences: 14 decimeters and 35 decimeters.
2. First, we need to find the prime factors to determine the LCM. The prime factorization of 14 is $2 \times 7$, while for 35 it is $5 \times 7$.
3. Now, we'll determine the highest powers of these primes from both numbers: $2^1, 5^1, 7^1$. The LCM of two numbers is found by multiplying them together once they've been expressed in terms of the highest powers of their common and distinct prime factors.
4. Thus, multiplying these we find that $\text{LCM}(14, 35) =  2 \times 5 \times 7 = 70$ decimeters is the path for one complete revolution of both wheels.
5. However, since we are dealing with full revolutions, we need to consider the rotation count of both wheels within this distance. The front wheel with a circumference of 14 decimeters rotates $\frac{70}{14} = 5$ times, while the rear wheel with a circumference of 35 decimeters rotates $\frac{70}{35} = 2$ times.
6. We look for the first time both wheels complete a whole number of rotations together when they meet. Since their lowest common multiple of rotations is 1 ($5+2=7$), we realize that both have already completed a full cycle in seven whole revolutions, but that's not asking about the least path.

Translation of the given problem: A student won a prize in an exam by securing a total rank of 176, with a difference of 10 marks between his ranks in English and Math. The higher rank was in Math than in English. We need to find out what is the student's rank in English.

2. Let's denote the rank of the student in English as E and the rank of the student in Math as M. According to the question, we have two pieces of information:
   - The total rank (sum of both subjects) is 176. So, E + M = 176.
   - There is a difference of 10 marks between the English and Math ranks, with Math being higher, so M = E + 10.

3. Substitute M from the second equation into the first equation: E + (E + 10) = 176. Combine like terms to get 2E + 10 = 176.

4. Solve for E. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 2E = 166.

5. Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate E: E = 83.

3. However, since ranks are usually whole numbers, let's consider that there might have been a rounding error or the question implies it's the closest lower number before addition of 10 in Math rank. In this case, we can say that English rank is either 82 or 83 (if considering the original problem without additional context).

6. So, if E = 82, then M = E + 10 = 92, and M + E = 174 (which doesn't match the total rank of 176), so this case is not valid.

7. Alternatively, if E = 83, then M = E + 10 = 93, and M + E = 176 (this matches the given total rank).

Answer: E = 83 or 82 depending on which interpretation you follow in the context of potential rounding errors. However, the most fitting answer in the context of ranks would be the close lower integer, **""Answer: 82""**.

Translating the Bengali terms we get: Find the smallest four-digit number that can be divided by 12, 15, 20, and 35.

2. **Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 15, 20, and 35. The LCM is the smallest number that all these numbers divide into without a remainder. We proceed as follows:

- Prime factorize each number:
   - \(12 = 2^2 \cdot 3\)
   - \(15 = 3 \cdot 5\)
   - \(20 = 2^2 \cdot 5\)
   - \(35 = 5 \cdot 7\)
   
- The LCM is found by taking the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in any of the numbers:
   - For the number \(2\), maximum power is \(2^2\).
   - For the number \(3\), maximum power is \(3^1\).
   - For the number \(5\), maximum power is \(5^1\).
   - We also have new factors \(7^1\) from 35.

   Therefore, \[ LCM(12, 15, 20, 35) = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \]
   \[ LCM(12, 15, 20, 35) = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \]
   
- Multiplying these gives us:
   - \( LCM(12, 15, 20, 35) = 420 \)

A shopkeeper bought a bag of rice weighing 50 kilograms for 1600 rupees. Due to price drop, he sold it for 1500 rupees. How much loss did he incur?

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
To determine the shopkeeper's loss, we need to find the difference between the selling price and the buying price.
Step 1: Calculate the cost per kilogram of rice in the initial purchase. (1600 Rupees / 50 kg) = 32 Rupees/kg
Step 2: Now calculate the total revenue from selling the rice at the reduced price. (1500 Rupees for 50 kg) = 30 Rupees/kg
Step 3: Find the difference between these values to determine the loss. Loss per kg = (Revenue per kg - Cost per kg) = (30 - 32) rupees/kg = -2 rupees/kg
Step 4: Since the shopkeeper sold all 50 kilograms, multiply this individual loss by the total weight of the rice. Total Loss = (-2 Rupees/kg * 50 kg) = -100 Rupees
Since we are looking for a positive value of loss (representing money lost), the answer will be an absolute value of -100 Rupees, which is 100 rupees.

2. Detailed step-by-step solution:
Let's denote by x the number of adult tickets sold and y the number of children's tickets sold. We know that two pieces of information:
- The total revenue generated from ticket sales is £540, so the sum of total adult and children tickets is 80. Therefore, we can write our first equation as: $$x + y = 80$$
- The revenue from selling adult tickets plus the revenue from selling kids tickets equals the total amount collected, which is £540. So, for each adult ticket at £7.5 and each kid ticket at £4.5, we can set up our second equation: $$7.5x + 4.5y = 540$$
Now that we have a system of two equations and two unknowns, let's solve this system:
   - Multiply the first equation by 4.5 to eliminate y: $$3x + (4.5 * y) = 80 \times 4.5$$
   - Replace 'y' from the second equation into first equation resulting in: $$ 3x + 4.5 y = 360 $$
   - Simplify it to yield one clear equation: $$x = \frac{360 – 4.5 * 80}{3}$$
   - Calculate 'x' as an integer value, which gives x = 32.
   
Given 'x = 32', this signifies that there were 32 adult tickets sold or in the context of original problem 32 senior citizen tickets sold.

2. Step-by-Step English Solution:

- Find the sum of the weights of the measured flowers: 235 + 120 + 365 = 720 grams
- Since we have an average, we need to consider this as a sample and calculate the mean weight of these 3 flowers: Mean weight (3 flowers) = Sum of weights / Number of flowers = 720 / 3 = 240 grams
- We are given that the total number of flowers in the box is 30. Use the average weight to find the total weight of all the 30 flowers: Total weight (30 flowers) = Average weight * Number of flowers = 240 * 30 = 7200 grams
- Convert the total weight from grams to kilograms: Weight in kg = 7200 / 1000 = 7.2 kg

2. **Detailed Solution**: Let's denote the smaller integer as x and the larger one as y. According to the problem, we have:

   1) x * y = 98 (since their product gives 98)

   2) y = 2x (as the bigger number is twice the smaller one).

3. Now, we need to use our algebra skills to solve for 'x'. We can start by substituting the relationship of y into the first equation:

   x * (2x) = 98
   2 * x^2 = 98

4. Next comes simplifying and finding x:

   x^2 = 98 / 2
   x^2 = 49

5. Finally, solve for 'x' by taking the square root of both sides. Given that it is a positive integer problem, we consider only the positive square root:

   x = sqrt(49)
   x = 7
   
   So, the smaller number is indeed 7.

First, we need to understand the initial condition that when 2750 taka is used to buy a box of oranges, a loss of 450 taka occurs. This implies that the cost price (CP) of the box of oranges is greater than 2750 taka by 450 taka.

2. In other words, the true cost price (TCP) of the box of oranges can be calculated as:
   TCP = Initial selling price + Loss
   TCP = 2750 taka + 450 taka
   TCP = 3200 taka

3. Now, we need to find out whether selling the box at 3600 taka is a profit or a loss and by how much. To do this, we compare the selling price (SP) with the true cost price (TCP).
   Profit = SP - TCP

4. If the selling price at 3600 taka was higher than the TCP of 3200 taka, it would be a profit:
   3600 taka > 3200 taka, which indeed confirms profit. Now we calculate the profit:
   Profit = 3600 taka - 3200 taka
   Profit = 400 taka

5. Therefore, selling the box of oranges at 3600 taka would yield a profit of 400 taka.

Translation of the Problem (from Bengali to English): One person has 5000 rupees. He dividends this amount equally among two people such that the money with the first person is four times that of the second person's money. Additionally, if the first person gives 1500 more rupees to the second one, they will have equal money.

2. Solution in English:
Let's denote First Person's shares as \( F \) and Second Person's shares as \( S \).

**Step 1**: The first condition states that the money with the first person is four times that of the second person's money after dividing them equally. The equation is:
\[ F = 4S \]

**Step 2**: The total money the two persons have after the division and before adding extra amounts is still 5000 rupees, so we write the sum of shares as:
\[ F + S = 5000 \]

Now we solve this system of equations:
- We already know from Step 1 that \( F = 4S \)
- Substituting this into the equation we get from Step 2, we get:
\[ 4S + S = 5000 \]
\[ 5S = 5000 \]
\[ S = 1000 \]
Since \( S = 1000 \) and given that \( F = 4S \), it follows that:
\[ F = 4(1000) = 4000 \]
So, the first person had initially 4000 rupees while the second person had 1000 rupees.

**Step 3**: The second condition refers to an additional scenario where he gives the second person extra 1500 ripe, and in this way they have equal amounts. Therefore:
\[ ( \text{Initial share of first person} - 1500) = ( \text{New share of second person} ) \]
So, Second Person's new amount becomes \( 1000 + 1500 = 2500 \), and we see that the equation holds for First Person also as:

Translation of the problem: In a park, there is a banyan tree and a pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. Currently, the age of the pine tree is 1432 years. What is the current age of the banyan tree?

The problem involves two trees and provides information about their combined age 150 years ago and the current age of one tree, as well as a time difference. We want to find the age of the other tree currently.

2. Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Let's denote the current age of the banyan tree as $x$ (in years).
Given that 150 years ago, their ages combined were 2961 years and the pine tree was 1432 years old now, we can write the following equations considering their age has increased by those 150 years:
\[
\begin{align*}
&\text{Combined age equation (Banyan tree + Pine tree) = Sum of their ages 150 years ago:} \\
&x - 30\;\; \text{(since we are looking for their present combined age)} + 1432 = 2961 \\
&\text{Solve this equation to find:} \\
& x - 30 = 2961 - 1432 \\
&x - 30 = 1529 \\
&x = 1559\;\; \text{(which is the combined age of both trees now)}
\end{align*}
\]

Step 2: Now we isolate $x$ to find the present age of Banyan tree. Since in Step 1, we got a combined present age for both trees which is 1559 years. We need to subtract Pine tree's present age from this value to find the Banyan tree's present age:
\[
x = 1559 - 1432 = 127 \\

\]

2. Let's denote our sought number as 'n'. Then, we have the equation as follows:
   \(x^2 = (5605 - n)\) where x is an integer representing the side of a square. To make it easy for us to comprehend, we've denoted the perfect square as 'x', and the number we need to subtract from 5605 is 'n'.

3. In order to find the smallest 'n', let's begin by considering the perfect squares around 5605. Perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc., which result when you square an integer. The largest perfect square smaller than 5605 is:

4. Now, let's calculate the difference between 5605 and 5476: \(5605 - 5476 = 129\).

However, since we're looking for the smallest value to make it a perfect square, we go with the negative difference:

   Gitah has less money than Simu, and Shihab has more than Gita but still less than Simu. The amount of money Simu has is not provided in the statement. However, we are given that Shihab has $210 more than Gita and that Simu's amount ($420) is less than what Gitah has by $350.
   
   So here are the respective variables:
   - G = money with Gitah
   - S = money with Shihab
   - Si = money with Simu

   We are given:
   Si = 420 dollars (Simu's amount)

   And from the statements:
   S = G + 210 (Shihab has $210 more than Gita)
   
   And
   
   Si - G = 350 (Gitah has $350 less than Simu)

2. Detailed solution steps:
    1. Firstly we need to find out the amount of money Gitah had, since Simu's amount is given and he has more money than both Gita and Shihab.
     420 - 350 = 70 dollars (Gitah has $70 with him).
     
    2. Next we determine the number of dollars Shihab's money:
       Since Shihab has $210 more than Gitah, it means:
       70 + 210 = 280

The problem states that some money is to be divided between Lobib, Saim and Siaram in the ratio of 5 : 4 : 2. It also gives a condition that if Siaram receives 180 taka, we need to find out how much taka Saim will receive.

2. Firstly, let's understand the given ratio of distribution of money among Lobib, Saim and Siaram which is 5 : 4 : 2 respectively. This means for every unit quantity of money distributed, Lobib gets 5 parts, Saim gets 4 parts and Siaram gets 2 parts.

3. The total ratio units can be calculated as the sum of individual parts:
   Total Ratio Units = Ratio of Lobib + Ratio of Saim + Ratio of Siaram
   Total Ratio Units = 5 + 4 + 2
   Total Ratio Units = 11

4. Next, let's denote the total amount of money to be divided among Lobib, Saim and Siaram as 'X'. According to the given condition that Siaram receives 180 taka, we set his share equal to 2 parts of the ratio:
   2 * Share_Of_ Siaram = 180 Taka
   Therefore, Share_Of_ Siaram = 180 / 2
   Share_Of_ Siaram = 90 Taka

5. We now know that each part in the ratios corresponds to money amount which is XY taka (where Y is the value of one ratio unit):
   Share_Of_ Saim = 4 * (XY)

6. Since we already determined that 2Y equals 90 Taka, therefore 1Y equals 90 / 2 and subsequently:
   Share_Of_ Saim = 4 * (90/2)
   Share_Of_ Saim = 4 * 45
   Share_Of_ Saim = 180 Taka

""The smallest natural number, when multiplied by 432, gives a perfect square number.""

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:
To find the smallest natural number (n) that makes 432 into a perfect square when multiplied, we first need to factorize 432 and make it a perfect square by multiplying it with the least possible value.

Step 1: Factorize 432.
- 432 = 2 * 216
- 216 = 2 * 108
- 108 = 2 * 54
- 54 = 2 * 27
- 27 = 3 * 9
- 9 = 3 * 3
Therefore, 432 = 2^3 * 3^2.

Step 2: Identify the square factors in the prime factorization of 432 that will make it a perfect square when squared. In this case, those are powers greater than or equal to 1 that have even exponents. The present condition is that we don't have even exponents for 2 and 3.

Step 3: Multiply the square root value of its prime factors (without a square) from both sides to make it a perfect square. The least possible number to do this would be n = 2 * 3 = 6, since 2 has an odd exponent of 1 and multiplying by 2 will make it even while also dealing with the power of 3 being odd (since multiplying by 3 is sufficient).

Step 4: Multiply 432 by n = 6 to verify.
- 432 * 6 = 896
Now factorize again:
- 896 = 2 * 448
- 448 = 2 * 224
- 224 = 2 * 112
- 112 = 2 * 56
- 56 = 2 * 28
- 28 = 2 * 14

If 15 balls are bought for 75 Takas and sold at a price of 90 Takas, what percentage profit will be achieved?

2. Step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
Let's denote the cost price (CP) of 1 ball as x (in Takas). So, the total cost price for 15 balls is 15x.

Given that these 15 balls are bought for 75 Takas, we have:
15x = 75 Takas...(Equation 1)

Next, let's denote the selling price (SP) of 1 ball as y (in Takas). So, the total selling price for 15 balls is 15y.

Given that these 15 balls are sold at a price of 90 Takas, we have:
15y = 90 Takas...(Equation 2)

Now, let's solve Equation 2 for y:
y = 90 / 15
y = 6 Takas

Since the selling price (SP) of 1 ball is equal to 6 Takas, the profit per ball can be calculated as follows:
Profit per ball = SP - CP = 6 - x

To find out the percentage profit, we'll also need to find the cost price (CP) of 1 ball. So, let's solve Equation 1 for x:
x = 75 / 15
x = 5 Takas

Now that we know CP (cost price) and SP (selling price), we can calculate the profit per ball:
Profit per ball = 6 - 5 = 1 Takas

To express this profit as a percentage, let's use the following formula:
(Profit/CP) * 100%

Substituting the values, we get:
((1)/(5)) * 100% = 20%

   ""Find the smallest number that is divisible by each of the numbers 18, 24, and 42.""

2. Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
    - First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the given numbers (18, 24, and 42). The LCM is the smallest number that is divisible by each of these numbers without leaving a remainder.
    - To calculate the LCM, let's first factorize 18, 24, and 42 into their prime factors:
        - \(18 = 2 \times 3^2\)
        - \(24 = 2^3 \times 3\)
        - \(42 = 2 \times 3 \times 7\)
    - The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of each prime number present in any of the factorizations:
        - Highest power of 2: \(2^3\) (from 24)
        - Highest power of 3: \(3^2\) (from 18)
        - Power of 7: \(7\) (from 42)
    - Multiply these together to get the LCM:

So if there are 28 reading books, we need to find out what 28 is to 4 as our unknown (total books) is to 7 (sum of parts of the ratio). Mathematically, this can be represented as:
    \[ \frac{28}{4} = x/7 \]
   Solving for x gives:
    \[ x = \frac{28*7}{4} \]
   Calculating this we get our total number of books:
    \[ x = 49 \]

2. To solve this problem, let's understand that the total amount of money is divided equally among three parts. The ratio is 4:3:1 which means that for every 4 units Maimuna gets 3 units go to Raisa and 1 unit remains with Raisa or a part of the pool.

3. We can represent this mathematically as follows: Total Units = 4 + 3 + 1; Raisa's number of units = 1 (given out of the total)

4. To find out how much Raisa will get, we need to multiply her share by the value of one unit: Raisa gets 9600 * (1/8). This fraction arises since there are a total of 8 parts in the ratio given as 4+3+1.

5. Compute that:
   9600 * (1/8) = 9600 / 8 = 1200

""A tea seller buys tea leaves at Rs. 80 per kg and sells them at a loss of Rs. 500 when he sells each kg of tea leaves at Rs. 75. How many kg of tea leaves did he buy?""

2.Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:

Let's denote the number of kg of tea leaves the seller bought as 'T'.
The cost price (CP) for 1Kg of tea leaves = Rs. 80
The selling price (SP) for 1Kg of tea leaves = Rs. 75

Then, Loss = CP - SP = 80 - 75 = Rs. 5 per kg

According to the problem, the total loss from selling all tea leaves is Rs. 500. So we can write the equation as:
(Loss per kg * Number of kg) = Total Loss
5T = 500
Solving for T gives us the number of kg the seller bought. Divide both sides by 5 to find T:
T = 500 / 5
T = 100

   ""Tisha Marma's income increased from 8% to 10%, and her income increased by 128 Takas over 4 years. What was Tisha Marma's initial capital?""

2. Detail step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
Let the principal amount (initial capital) be denoted by ""P"". The annual increase in income is from 8% to 10%. This means there is an additional 2% of the principal every year on top of the original 8%. So, the total annual increase can be represented as:
(8/100) * P + (2/100) * P = (10/100) * P
This expression confirms that there's an increase of 2% extra. Now we know that a 4-year period, the earnings increased by 128 Takas in total. So, let's write out this information algebraically:
4 years * (Annual Increase) = Total Increase
4 * (P(10 - 8)/100) = 128
Since (10 - 8)/100 simplifies to 2/100, the equation becomes:
4 * P(2/100) = 128
Now we can solve for P:
P = 128 / (4 * 2/100)
P = 128 / (8/100)
P = 16,000/4
P = 4,000

Carpeting this house with 75 rupees for each square meter costs a total of 11,025 rupees. There are 40 square centimeters in one tile. How many ceramic tiles, each of 40 square centimeters, are needed to cover the square-shaped room?

2. Detailed step-by-step solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the area of both the octagonal house and the square-shaped room (which is actually the same, since their perimeters are equal). Let's go through it in steps:

a) Finding the breadth (B) and length (L):
Since the length is three times the breadth, we can say L = 3B.

b) Calculating area of the square-shaped room:
Let 'S' be the side length of the square. As the perimeter of both shapes is equal, S = Perimeter_of_octagon / 4 (since a square has 4 sides).
The area of the square is A_square = S^2.

c) Calculating area of the octagonal house:
In an octagon, there are eight angles each being 135° (135 degrees) between sides. By knowing two adjacent sides, we can calculate its area using some geometry. However, for simplicity, let's reuse the perimeter relation: The perimeter of the octagon can be considered as equivalent to four times the side length S we found earlier for the square.

""If it takes 3/5 of a bag of paint to cover 1/3 of a wall, how many square meters of wall can be covered with 1 liter of paint?""

2. Solution in English:
To solve this problem, we need to find a proportional relationship between the amount of paint and the area it covers. We are given that 3/5 of a bag (let's assume 'x' is the capacity of the bag) can cover 1/3 of a wall. We want to find out how much area can be covered with 1 liter of paint (we will consider this 1 liter as a part of 'x').

Step 1: Define variables and expressions.
Let x be the capacity of the bag in liters (for simplicity, we assume the bag has a volume equivalent to 5/3 liters). Since 3/5 of this bag is used to cover 1/3 of the wall, we can express this relationship as follows:

Relative Paint Distribution = Parts Used / Total Capacity
(3/5)x = Area covered by paint

Step 2: Find the proportion between paint volume and area covered.
Now, we want to find out how much area can be covered with 1 liter of paint (which is assumed to be an arbitrary quantity representing part 'y'). We need a relationship proportional to the given one but adjusted in the amount of paint used:

(1/x)'y' = Area covered when 'y' liters are used

Step 3: Relate areas using proportions.
To relate both situations (within their respective units), we use the previous formula and set '3/5 of the bag' equivalent to our '1 liter':

(3/x)'y' = Area covered with y liters

We know that 3/5 of a bag is equal to the full wall, so we set up the proportion:

((3/5)x -> Full wall covered), (y -> Unknown area to cover)

So that:

(y / (1/3)) = Area of the wall
(y -> x*Full)/(3/5)

Step 4: Solve for y.

Translation of the Problem: In a square plot, 1800 saplings were planted such that there are 36 more trees than the number of saplings in each row. Determine the number of saplings in one row.

2. Solution and Steps:
   - We start by noting that if we add 36 trees to the square root of the total saplings, it equals the total number of saplings. So, let's denote the number of saplings per row as x. Thus, mathematically, (√(1800) + 36) = x
   - Since this is a square plot and the plants form a square pattern when planted, we can express the total count of saplings as a quadratic equation: x² + 2*x*(36) -1800 = 0

Now let's solve for x step by step:
   - Simplify the equation: x² + 72x - 1800 = 0
   - Factorize the quadratic equation to find the roots (x1, x2). After factoring we get, (x - 30)(x +60) = 0.
   - The possible solutions are x1 = 30 and x2 =-60. Since, the number of trees cannot be negative, we consider only positive value: x=30.

   Problem: Raju and Rani together have 690 mangoes. Raju has 86 mangoes more than Rani. How many mangoes does Raju have?

2. Now, let's solve this step by step in English.
   Let the number of mangoes Rani has be represented as x.

Step 1: We know that Raju has 86 mangoes more than Rani, so we can represent the number of mangoes Raju has as x + 86.

Step 2: Together, they have 690 mangoes. So, x (number of mangoes Rani has) plus x + 86 (number of mangoes Raju has) equals 690. This gives us the equation: x + x + 86 = 690

Step 3: Simplify the equation to get 2x + 86 = 690

Step 4: Subtract 86 from both sides of the equation to solve for x. This gives us 2x = 604.

Step 5: Divide both sides by 2 to find x, which is the number of mangoes Rani has. This results in x = 302

Now that we have found out how many mangoes Rani has, we can calculate how many mangoes Raju has.

Step 6: Add 86 (the difference) to x (Rani's mangoes) to find the number of mangoes Raju has, which is Raju’s mangoes = Rani's mangoes + difference = 302 + 86

2. Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations:
Firstly, let's find out how much money Abir has in total. He has 10 notes of each denomination (10 Takas, 20 Takas and 50 Takas), so:

Total money = 10 * 10 + 10 * 20 + 10 * 50

Next we calculate the total amount:

= 100 + 200 + 500

= 800 Takas

Now, Abir needs to make a payment of 190 Takas. To do this using the minimum number of notes possible, he should start with the highest denomination (50 Takas) first to reduce the number of notes used:

First note = 1 * 50 = 50 Takas
Remaining amount = 190 - 50 = 140 Takas

Next two 20 Takas notes can fulfill the remaning 120 Takas with another 20:

Second and third note = 2 * 20 = 40 Takas
Remaining amount = 140 - 40 = 100 Takas

Finally, use one 50 Takas note and two 10 Takas notes to make up the last 40 Takas needed:

Fourth and fifth note = 2 * 10 + 1 * 50 = 60 Takas (exceeds the left amount, hence we don't use it here)
Sixth and seventh note = 3 * 20 + 1 * 5 = 60 - 80 Takas (incorrect calculation here; instead, use three 10 Takas notes and one more 20 Takas note to make up the left amount correctly):

2. Solution Steps:
   Let's denote the smaller number as x and the bigger number as y. According to the given conditions, we can form two equations:

Equation 1: y = 2x - 9 (since the bigger number is twice the smaller number minus 9)

Equation 2: x + y = 42 (since their sum is 42)

We substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2 to eliminate one variable:

x + (2x - 9) = 42

3x - 9 = 42

Adding 9 to both sides of the equation gives us:

3x = 51

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 17

2. Solution:
   - First, convert the volume from liters to cubic meters. Since 1 liter = 0.001 cubic meters, we have:
     \[
     8000 \text{ L} \times 0.001 \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{L}} = 8 \text{ m}^3

- The volume of a rectangular tank is given by the formula \(V = l \times w \times h\), where \(V\) is the volume, \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height (or depth in this context).
     - Rearrange the formula to solve for the depth:
       \[
       h = \frac{V}{l \times w}

   - Substitute the known values into the rearranged formula:
     \[
     h = \frac{8 \text{ m}^3}{2.56 \text{ m} \times 1.25 \text{ m}} = \frac{8 \text{ m}^3}{3.2 \text{ m}^2} = 2.5 \text{ m}

2. Detailed Solution:
Let's denote the total number of fruits as F. We know that the total number of fruits is the sum of half of apples (A), one-third of oranges (O), and 40 mangoes (M). Mathematically, this can be represented as:
F = A + O + M

We are given that half of his apples are present, so A = F/2. Similarly, we know one-third of his oranges are present, hence O = F/3. The total number of mangoes is directly provided, so M = 40. Now, substituting these values back into the equation:
F = (F/2) + (F/3) + 40

To solve for F, first make a common denominator by multiplying each term by the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6:
6F = 3F + 2F + 240

Combine like terms:

   ""A rectangular container holds 19200 liters of water. Its depth is 2.56 meters and width is 2.5 meters. What is its length?""

2. Step-by-step solution with explanations:
   To find the length of the container, we first convert the volume from liters to cubic meters because the given dimensions are already in meters (1 liter = 0.001 cubic meters). So, 19,200 liters is equivalent to 19200/1000 = 19.2 cubic meters.

   Next, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which applies to our container): volume = length * width * depth
   19.2 = length * 2.5 * 2.56

   Simplifying, we get:

   19.2 = 6.4 * length

   Dividing both sides by 6.4 (to find the length) yields:

   Length = 19.2 / 6.4

   Performing the division gives us:

Step-by-step solution with explanations:\n   To find the length of the container, we first convert the volume from liters to cubic meters because the given dimensions are already in meters (1 liter = 0.001 cubic meters). So, 19,200 liters is equivalent to 19200/1000 = 19.2 cubic meters.\n\n   Next, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which applies to our container): volume = length * width * depth\n   19.2 = length * 2.5 * 2.56\n\n   Simplifying, we get:\n\n   19.2 = 6.4 * length\n\n   Dividing both sides by 6.4 (to find the length) yields:\n\n   Length = 19.2 / 6.4\n\n   Performing the division gives us:\n\n   Length = 3 meters\n\n3.

Translation of the Bengali problem into English: ""If a piece of cloth that is 20 meters long is divided among three brothers, Amal, Sumal, and Chaitir, in the ratio of 5 : 3 : 2, what is the amount of cloth Chaitir gets?""

2. Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:
   a. First, we need to determine the total parts into which the cloth will be divided. The given ratio is 5 : 3 : 2 for Amal, Sumal, and Chaitir respectively. Adding these together gives us the total parts:
     Total parts = Amal's share + Sumal's share + Chaitir's share
                = 5 + 3 + 2
                = 10 parts

   b. Next, we find out how much cloth one part represents by dividing the total cloth length by the number of parts:
     Cloth per part = Total cloth length / Total parts
                    = 20 meters / 10 parts
                    = 2 meters

   c. Finally, to find Chaitir's share, we multiply Chaitir's ratio (which is 2) by the length of one part:
     Chaitir's cloth = Chaitir's ratio * Cloth per part
                    = 2 * 2 meters

   Now let's set up two equations to represent the problem using algebraic expressions:

   Let x be the amount of money taken at 6% interest and y be the amount of money taken at 4% interest. So we have:

   Equation (1) x + y = 56000 .....(since the total loan amount is 56000 taka.)

""Write down the ratio of three angles in an isosceles triangle.""

2. Solution with step-by-step explanation:

Given that we are dealing with an isosceles triangle, it has two base angles that are equal. Let's denote those equal angles as ""x"". Since the sum of interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees (or π radians), we can set up a simple equation to solve for x:

Step 1: Write the sum of interior angles formula:
x + x + third_angle = 180°

Step 2: Combine like terms:
2x + third_angle = 180°

Step 3: Since it's an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. The third angle is therefore the vertex, which we can denote as ""y"". So our equation changes to:
2x + y = 180°

Step 4: We already determined that two of our angles are equal, x = y for simplicity in this scenario. Thus, rewrite our equation with a single variable:
2x + x = 180°
3x = 180°

Step 5: Solve for ""x"":
x = 180° / 3
x = 60°

Since x = y, third_angle (vertex angle) equals to 60° as well.

The ratio of the three angles will hence be:
x : x : y = a : b : c = 60° : 60° : a-b+c with a slight adjustment for clarity, the ratio is reduced to a simple ratio in terms of common factors. In mathematical terms that would look like:

a : b : c = 2: 2: 1

""When a smallest number is added to 5605, the sum becomes a perfect square.""
2. Solution with step-by-step reasoning:
    - To find the smallest number that when added to 5605 results in a perfect square, we need to analyze the remainder of 5605 when divided by 9 (since any number that is a multiple of 3 or 4 will leave a remainder less than 9).
    - Calculating, $5605 \mod 9 = 5$, which means 5605 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 9.
    - The difference between the two closest perfect squares is $(n+1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1$. For the difference to be divisible by 9, $2n + 1$ must also be divisible by 9. However, we only need to adjust our target by adding a multiple of 9 to 5605 so that it becomes a perfect square immediately.
    - We know $(3k)^2 = 9k^2$, a multiple of 9 squared gives us some idea of what the smallest k would be for this problem.
    Calculating further, we add 4 (the smallest number) to get:
          If $5605 + 4 = 5609$   (because adjusting for $2n + 1$, n=2 and nearest perfect square would be $(3*2)^2$)

    - We have three scenarios involving 12, 15, and 20 students in a row respectively.
    - We also know that there is a square arrangement scenario. A square formation implies an equal number of rows and columns which is typically the square root of the total students.

If all possible 2x2 squares need to be filled without overlap, we'd require more than the sum of individual series students present for each scenario.

2. Let's denote the length as L and the width as W. According to the problem, the product of L and W is equal to twice their value (LW = 2LW). This implies that there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the given information isn't accurate, as a rectangle's area would be calculated by multiplying its length and width (A = LW, not LW = 2LW).
3. Assuming the problem is meant to say that LW = 216 square meters, to find the perimeter we need to know one side or the ratio of sides. If we take the case where both length and width are equal (a square), then L = W, so L^2 = 216 -> L = sqrt(216) = 14.
4. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(L + W). For this case with a square, P = 2(14 + 14) = 56 meters. But remember this assumes both sides being equal.

# Step-by-step Solution:
1. The total area of the country is approximately 3,287,263 sq. km.
2. The forest land occupies about 754,740 sq. km.
3. The river basins occupy about 2,503,000 sq. km.
4. To find the remaining area, we need to subtract the areas occupied by forests and rivers from the total area:

   - M + S = 60 (combined age)
   - M = 3S (mother's age is three times the son's age)

We can solve this problem using substitution or elimination method. Here, I will use substitution. We substitute M in the first equation with its equivalent value from the second equation:

M + S = 60
3S + S = 60 (substitute M with 3S)

The problem can be transcribed in English as follows: ""There is a rod half of which lies on the ground, one-third on water, and the rest on top of the water with the length on water being 3 meters. How long is the part of this rod on the water?""
2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning.
Let's denote that Rod has length L in total. Half of it lies on the land and is denoted by 1/2 L = 0.5L and one-third of it lies on water and is denoted by 1/3 L = 0.333L and we know that the rest portion above the water holds a length of 3 meters and this portion is the remainder of rod's length which is (remaining length) = L - (0.5L + 0.333L).
Given:
L = Rod total length
0.5L = Half portion on ground
0.333L = One third portion on water
Remaining length (Water top portion) = Length above the water = 3 meters
We can write the equation to find out Rod's portion on water as follows:
Remaining length = L - (0.5L + 0.333L)
Solving the equation for L gives us the length of rod portion on water
3= L - (0.5L + 0.333L)
3 = L - (0.8333L)
Therefore,
L = 3 / (1- 0.8333)
L = 3 / 0.1667

Length on water =0.333L
=0.333 * L

Translation of the problem in English: A fish seller bought each piece of hilsa fish at a price of BDT 1600 and sold it for BDT 350 each. What is the percentage profit or loss he made?
2. Solution:
Let's consider the unit cost (UC) and unit selling price (USP). The seller bought each piece for BDT 1600, so UC = BDT 1600. He sold these pieces for BDT 350 each, so USP = BDT 350.
The difference between the selling price and cost price is known as profit or loss. Here, since the cost is less than the price at which he sold, this indicates a loss. The loss can be calculated using the formula:
Loss (L) = UC - USP
L = BDT 1600 - BDT 350
L = BDT 1250
The percentage loss (PL%) is then determined by the following formula:
Percentage loss = (L / UC) * 100
Pl% = (BDT 1250 / BDT 1600) * 100%
Pl% = 78.125% (approximately)

The painting cost for a square meter area of 3/5 square meters is 2 deciliters of paint. What area in square meters can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint?

2. Step-by-Step Solution in English:

    - Let's denote the number of square meters that 1 deciliter of paint can cover as X.

    - According to the problem, we know that 2 deciliters of paint is used for painting an area of (3/5) square meters. So we can set up the proportion: $$\frac{2 \text{ deciliters}}{3/5 \text{ sqm}} = \frac{1 \text{ deciliter}}{X \text{ sqm}}$$
    
    - We simplify this equation by multiplying both sides with the respective denominators: $$2 \text{ deciliters} * X \text{ sqm}) = 3/5 \text{ (sqm/dec) deciliters}$$
    
    - This simplifies to: $$2X = \frac{3}{5}*1$$ (since 1 deciliter is the same as 1 on the right side of the equation)
    
    - Solving for X gives us: $$X = \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{2}$$

2. **Solution**: The area of a rectangle is typically calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, we need to multiply \(\frac{7}{4}\) by \(\frac{6}{5}\):

   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{7}{4} \times \frac{6}{5}
   \]

3. **Explanation**: When performing multiplication, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators (bases of the fractions) together:

   \[
   \text{Numerator product} = 7 \times 6 = 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator product} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

Thus, the area of the rectangle is:

   \[
   \frac{42}{20}
   \]

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:

   \[
   \text{Simplified fraction} = \frac{42/2}{20/2} = \frac{21}{10}

   The problem states that the product of two positive numbers is 162 and their ratio (quotient) is 2. We need to find these two numbers and determine which one is the smaller.

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations:

   - Let's denote the two numbers as a and b, where a > b.
   - We know that their product (a * b) equals 162 and their ratio (a / b) equals 2.
   - From the ratio, we can determine that a is twice b: a = 2b.
   - Substitute a in the product equation with its equivalent from the ratio relationship: 2b * b = 162.
   - This simplifies to: 2b² = 162.
   - Divide both sides by 2 to isolate b²: b² = 81.

Translate the Bengali problem: The population of a city is two million eight hundred sixty-three thousand six hundred, which includes two thousand five hundred males and two thousand four hundred fifty-five females. We need to find the number of children.

2. To find the number of children, we first calculate the total population by adding the numbers given in the problem:
- Two million eight hundred sixty-three thousand six hundred can be written as 2,086,306
   - Two thousand five hundred males is 2,500,000
   - Two thousand four hundred fifty-five females is 2,455,000

Then we subtract the total number of adult males and females from the overall population:
- Population - Males - Females = Children
- 2,086,306 - 2,500,000 - 2,455,000 = -247,194

However, we made a mistake in our calculation. The numbers we were given were not subsets of the overall population because they sum to more than our total number (7500000). This means we only consider adults and then find the difference between the given numbers for children:
- Given number for children = (-247,194) - 100 (since the adult numbers should add up to zero to find children)
- Therefore, children's population is calculated as = 7500000 - (2500000 + 2455000) = 2,555,000.

So the number of children is 250,000 minus 247,194:
- Children's population = 14,806

""A train travels at a speed of 30 km/h from Kamlapur station to Narayanganj station. It takes 10 minutes longer than usual to travel 25 km. What is the distance between the two stations?""

2. Step-by-Step Solution with Explanations:

First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/h to km/min since the time given in minutes.

Speed in km/min = Speed in km/h / 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
Speed in km/min = 30 / 60 = 0.5 km/min

Now, we know that it takes 10 minutes longer to travel 25 km at a speed of 0.5 km/min than usual. So, let's find out the time it would normally take to travel this distance.

Let x be the normal time in minutes it takes for the train to travel 25 km. Then, according to the problem, we have:

x + 10 = Distance / Speed
x + 10 = 25 km / 0.5 km/min
x + 10 = 50 min
x = 40 min (normal time)

Now, let's find the normal speed of the train. We know that it covers 25 km in 40 minutes, or 5 km in 8 minutes since 40 is not a multiple of 1 hour. So, the speed is:

Normal Speed = Distance / Time
= 5 km / 8 min

To find the distance between Kamlapur and Narayanganj stations, we can use the normal time (40 minutes) and normal speed (5km/8min).

Distance = Speed * Time
= 5 km / 8 min * 40 min
= 25 km

2. Solution:
    To determine the minimum number of members required to form both types of groups (either 8 or 10 members), we can solve using logical deduction and divisibility:
     - For a group with multiple members, we need each combination that results in both 8-person and 10-person arrangements.
    - Analyzing the integer divison of combinations of 8 people into 10 people or vice versa, it is clear that the minimum number of additional individuals can be calculated from both 10-jacket members (since the 8 jacket does not divide perfectly). So we proceed with: 
        - The minimum count of individuals that allow both configurations is when we include all 8 + 2 in excess for multiple formation. The calculation here would follow finding whats divisible by both total possible combinations where:
    10 = 8 people x 1 remaindering (since 10-2) while remaining with extra person for division count 8 people for each combination, thus resulting:

The total age of a father and his son is 55 years. The father's age is four times the son's age. What is the father's age?
2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:
Let F be the father's age and S be the son's age. We are given that:
F + S = 55 (the total age)
F = 4S (the father's age is four times the son's age)
We can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate F:
(4S) + S = 55
Combine like terms:
5S = 55
Divide both sides by 5:
S = 11
Now, substitute this value back into the second equation to find F:
F = 4 * 11
F = 44
However, upon further examination of my initial response's logic, I have recognized that we made an error in interpreting the first given statement. The correct interpretation should be that the son's age is a quarter of the father's age, not the other way around. Thus, we will revise our solution accordingly:
F + S = 55 (the total age)
F = 4 * S (the father's age is four times the son's age)
We can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate F:
(4S) + S = 55
Combine like terms:
5S = 55
Divide both sides by 5:
S = 11
Now, substitute this value back into the corrected second equation to find F:
F = 4 * 11
F = 44
The final answer is the father's age, which we have derived as 44 years.

2. Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English:
A store is offering a discount of 20% on its items priced at 500 taka. Discount means a reduction in the original price of an item. To find out how much you would pay after the discount, we need to calculate 20% of 500 taka and then subtract that from the original price.

First, let's calculate 20% of 500 taka:
Discount amount = (20/100) * 500
= 0.2 * 500
= 100 taka

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much you would pay:
Final price = Original price - Discount amount
= 500 taka - 100 taka
= 400 taka

So, you would pay 400 taka after the discount. But we were prompted with a question about the ""sashray"" (discount) amount, not the final price. Hence:

Step 3:
- To find out how many trees will be left after this removal, we have to subtract the number of trees removed from the total number of trees. So, T - R = N (where T is the initial number of trees, R is the number of trees removed, and N is the number of trees that is kept).

Step 4:
- Substituting the values we have, N = 6 - 4 = 2.

3. Final Answer: There will be 2 trees left in the park after the workers remove 4 trees from it.

A cistern has two pipes. The first and second pipe can fill the empty cistern in 12 hours and 18 hours respectively (working individually). When both pipes are opened together, they completely fill the cistern. In how many hours will it be filled if both pipes are opened simultaneously?

2. Solution:
Suppose the capacity of the cistern is C liters (we'll use liters as the unit of measurement).
Let's denote the flow rate of the first pipe, P1, and the flow rate of the second pipe, P2. To fill the cistern completely in 12 hours, we can set up an equation like:

C = P1 * 12

We know that time = Volume / Flow, so P1 would be:
P1 = C/12 (Liters per hour)

Similarly, for the second pipe (we'll use the same capacity):
C = P2 * 18
P2 = C/18

When both pipes are opened together, their combined flow rate is:
Total Flow Rate = P1 + P2
                         = C/12 + C/18

To find the total time it takes for both pipes to fill the cistern when working together (T), we use this formula again:
Time= Volume / Total Flow Rate, hence:
T=C/(P1+P2)
T=C / (C/12 + C/18)
= 1 / [1/12 + 1/18]
= 1 / ((5+3)/36)
= 1 / (8/36)
= 36 / 8
= 4.5 hours

So, when both pipes are opened together, the cistern will be filled in 4.5 hours.

""Given, the sum of three consecutive natural numbers is 63. Find the smallest number.""

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning:

Let's denote the smallest number as 'x'. Since they are consecutive natural numbers, we can express the next two terms as 'x+1' and 'x+2'. According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 63. We can represent this information with an equation:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 63

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 3 = 63

Now, let's solve this step by step:
3. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x term:

3x + 3 - 3 = 63 - 3
3x = 60
4. Divide both sides by 3 to find the value of 'x':

(3x) / 3 = (60) / 3
x = 20

2. Let's denote the original principal amount as P. According to the problem, the interest earned in one year at an annual rate of 12% is equal to 1680 taka. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Interest = Principal * Rate
1680 = P * 0.12/100 (since percentage is out of 100)

   - First, we need to determine the total amount of work done by all four individuals in one day (i.e., the daily work rate).
   - Since Rajib, Debangana, Masum, and Taijmira can complete 150 units of work in 6 days, their combined daily work rate is equal to 150 units / 6 days = 25 units/day.

The annual compound interest rate is 8.50%. We need to find the total profit from an investment of 10,000 Taka in 2 years using compound interest.

2. Provide a detailed step-by-step solution with explanations in English, following the logical flow of reasoning.

To calculate the compound interest for 2 years, we use the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
A = the future value of the investment/loan after interest
P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

Since the problem doesn't explicitly state how the interest is compounded, we will assume it's compounded annually. So n = 1:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
A = 10000(1 + 8.5/100)^2 (since the annual interest rate as a decimal is 0.085 and t=2 years)

To find the total profit, subtract the principal investment from the future value:
Profit = A - P

3. Conclude with the final numerical answer, formatted as **""Answer: [num]""**.

A = 10000(1 + 0.085)^2 ≈ 10000 * 1.1769 ≈ 11769 Taka

Russell has 45 apples and 18 oranges. He wants to distribute them among several children to make sure that each child gets an equal number of apples and oranges, without leaving any fruit remaining. The question asks how many groups (or children) Russell can divide the fruits into?

2. To distribute apples and oranges equally among children, we need to find a common divisor of their quantities to determine possible groupings. In this case, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD).

- First, factorize the number of apples (45) and oranges (18):
    - 45 = 3^2 * 5
    - 18 = 2 * 3^2

- The prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. The common prime factor is 3^2.

- Compute the GCD by taking the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:
    - GCD(45, 18) = 3^2 = 9

3. Based on the GCD, we find that Russell can at most divide the fruits into groups where each group gets 9 apples and 9 oranges (since 9 is the common divisor). This means that he can distribute the fruits to 5 children (45 ÷ 9 = 5 for apples) or 2 children (18 ÷ 9 = 2 for oranges).

- Since we need to satisfy all constraints regarding equal distribution and no leftovers, Russell would divide them into groups of 3 pairs with 3 apples each and 6 oranges remaining. This way, each pair has 3*3=9 fruits (with possible leftover oranges).

4. Final answer:
- Answer: 3 groups or children per pair, 1 group or child of remaining fruits - total = **(3 + 3 = 6)**
- However, the actual GCD approach would suggest either 2 or 5 children being a valid choice by equal distribution without leftovers, so we box the answer in multiple ways:

To find the volume of the book, we need to calculate the area (A) of one page and then multiply it by the number of pages and the thickness. First, let's convert the thickness from millimeters to meters because our length and width are in centimeters.

    - Thickness = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 0.001 m (since 1 mm = 0.001 m) = 0.0001 m
    - Convert the length and width from cm to m:
      - Length in m = 25 cm / 100 (since 1 m = 100 cm) = 0.25 m
      - Width in m = 18 cm / 100 (since 1 m = 100 cm) = 0.18 m
    - Area of one page: A = length * width = 0.25 m * 0.18 m = 0.045 m² (square meters)
    - Volume of the book: V = A * number of pages * thickness = 0.045m² * 200 * 0.0001m = 9 cubic centimeters (since 1 cm³ = 0.001 m³)

   To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates. First, let's find out how much area one tractor can plow in one day. Let x be the amount of area one tractor can plow in one day.

From the first statement, we know that 4 tractors can plow 360 bighas in 20 days. This means that 1 tractor would take 80 days to plow 360 bighas (since they divide their work). We can express this as:
   4x · 20 = 360
   x · 80 = 360
   x = 360 / 80
   x = 4.5 (bighas per day)

Now, we need to find out how many tractors are needed to plow 1800 bighas in 10 days. Using the rate we just found:
   (x · y) · 10 = 1800

Let's denote the unknown number as x. According to the problem description:

2x + 5 = 25

To solve for x, we first isolate the term containing x by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 5 - 5 = 25 - 5

This simplifies to:

2x = 20

The problem starts by stating that we have a box containing 20 chamomile flowers, and we measured the weight of three of them, which were 335 grams, 320 grams, and 371 grams respectively. Our task is to find the total weight (in kilograms) of all 20 chamomile flowers based on their average or mean weight.

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the sum of weights of the three measured chamomile flowers.
Sum = 335 + 320 + 371 = 1026 grams

Step 2: Find the average or mean weight of one flower by dividing the total sum by the number of measurements taken.
Average weight of one flower = 1026 / 3 = 342 grams

Step 3: Multiply the average weight of one flower by the total number of flowers to find the total weight in grams.
Total weight of 20 chamomile flowers (in grams) = 342 * 20 = 6840 grams

Step 4: Since the task asks for the answer in kilograms, convert the total mass from grams to kilograms.
1 kilogram = 1000 grams   
Total weight of 20 flowers (in kilograms) = Total weight in grams / Grams per kilogram = 6840 / 1000 = 6.84

Sakir's attempt to arrange 450 pieces of yellow mustard seeds in a square pattern left him with 9 scattered seeds outside the square shape. I will calculate how many rows of mustard seeds Sakir had arranged, considering both full and partial rows.

2. Detailed step-by-step solution:
a. First, let's determine if it's possible to form a perfect square with the 441 mustard seeds (450 - 9).
b. If we find that Sakir could have arranged all of them in complete rows without any leftover, then we know there are 'n' full rows. So, \( n^2 = 441 \), which would indicate \( n = 21 \) rows on each side of the square. However, in this scenario, no remainder should exist as each row is an equal part of a whole number with no decimal places.
c. Since Sakir had 9 leftover seeds, he must've formed (n * m) full squares and then tried to fill out n rows in the remaining part, where 'm' would be the integer factor such that (n * m < 450). To establish what 'm' is we can solve:
\[ n * \text{integer} = 441 \]
d. We recognize from our preliminary calculation above that if \( n = 21 \), then \( m = 21 \) also holds true since \( 21^2 = 441 \). The problem states Sakir had extra seeds, and these must be the leftover in the final row formed. This would mean that 'm' equates to an additional row added outside of the proper square shape, implying a total of 22 rows if we include this partial row with less than complete seeds (9).
e. Now let's allocate exactly 9 extra seeds into this row. If the row length is consistent and based on our previous calculation, each side can only be composed of full segments if there is 1 seed leftover at any end. Therefore, we calculate \( 9 \div 2 = 4.5 \).

2. To find the sides of the rectangle in meters, we first need to convert the acres into square meters because 1 acre equals approximately 0.404685 square meters. So, the area in square meters is 10 * 0.404685 = 4.04685 m².
3. Since the length and breadth are in a 4:1 ratio, the length is four times of the breadth (L = 4x; B = x). So, L + B = 4x + x = 5x. The area formula = L * B = 404685 = 5x^2.

2. Solution:
First, let's find out how much money Altaf has left after spending on his monthly expenses.

Deducting the rent and family expenses from Altaf's monthly salary:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Monthly Salary} - \text{(Rent + Family Expenses)} \]
\[ = 9870 - (3800 + 5650) \]
\[ = 9870 - 9450 \]
\[ = 420 \]

So, Altaf manages to save ₹420 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total money saved by Altaf in a year:
\[ \text{Yearly Savings} = \text{Monthly Savings} \times 12 \]
\[ = 420 \times 12 \]
\[ = 5040 \]

Therefore, during the course of a year, Altaf saves ₹5040 in his bank account.

2. Let's denote the yearly percentage profit as 'P', and the initial capital investment as 'C'. The formula to represent the compounded annual growth can be represented as:
\[ C(1 + \frac{P}{100})^5 = 2C \]
Where \( C \) is the principal, which is in this case 130,000 USD. 
   
   We simplify this equation by dividing it by 'C' from both sides:
\[ (1 + \frac{P}{100})^5 = 2 \]
   
   Now take the fifth root on both sides to isolate \( P \):
\[ (1 + \frac{P}{100}) = 2^{\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)} \]
\[ 1 + \frac{P}{100} = \sqrt[5]{2} \]
   
   Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ \frac{P}{100} = \sqrt[5]{2} - 1 \]
   
   Now we isolate P by multiplying the whole equation with 100:
\[ P = (\sqrt[5]{2} - 1) * 100 \]
   
3. Calculate \( \sqrt[5]{2} \) which equals approximately 1.1487 (using a calculator for fifth root of 2). Now we substitute this back into the equation:

Debubabu has built a new house and plans to paint two equal-sized windows. Each window has two edges. If it takes 2 hours and 15 minutes to paint each edge, how much time in total will Debubabu spend painting both windows?

2. Providing the step-by-step solution:
We know that there are four edges (two for each window), so we calculate the time required as follows:
   2 (hours) + 15 (minutes) = 2 hours and 15 minutes per edge
   Time for one edge: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 15 minutes = 135 minutes
   Since there are four edges, the total painting time would be 4 * 135 = 540 minutes.
   To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 minutes: 540 / 60 = 9 hours.

Every year, he pays off £2000. After the second payment, how much loan will remain?

2. **Step-by-Step Solution**:
   - The principal amount borrowed is £5000 with a yearly growth rate of 8%, which implies that every year, the loan amount becomes (1 + 0.08) times its previous value.
   - To find out the amount after the first payment, we calculate (£5000 \* 1.08). This gives us £5400.

2. Solution:
   - Given that the sum of parts is \(5 + 4 + 2 = 11\), this implies that the total amount of money to be distributed is divided into 11 equal segments.
   - Siyam receives a share which consists of \(\frac{2}{11}\) of the total amount, and we know from the problem statement that his share is 180 Takas.
   - To find Labib's share which is \(\frac{5}{11}\) of the total amount, we first calculate the value of one segment:
     \[ \text{Value of one segment} = \frac{180}{\frac{2}{11}} = 180 \times \frac{11}{2} = 990 \, \text{Takas}\]
   - Therefore, Labib's share is:
     \[ \text{Labib's Share} = 990 \times \frac{5}{11} \]
   - Since \(990\) and \(11\) are both divisible by \(11\), we can simplify this to:

Salman Beguni's shirt is 7.70 meters long, and Madina Akashi's shirt is 3.26 meters long. Salman wants to cut both shirts into several pieces, making each piece of shirt from both colors have the same length. We need to find out the length of each piece such that after cutting, the total length of each color is reduced by 0.02 meters.

1. Detailed Solution:

Step 1: Calculate the difference in lengths before and after cutting.
The original lengths are 7.70 m (Salman's shirt) and 3.26 m (Madina's shirt). After reducing each piece by 0.02 meters, we have:
New length for Salman's shirt = 7.70 - y (where y is the length cut off in one piece)
New length for Madina's shirt = 3.26 - y (where y is the length cut off in one piece)

Step 2: Calculate the value of 'y'.
Since both new lengths should be equal, we can set them up as an equation:
7.70 - y = 3.26 - y

Solving for y:
y = 7.70 - 3.26
y = 4.44 meters

Step 3: Determine the length of each piece after cutting (x).
Since we know that Salman's and Madina's shirts will both have their total lengths reduced by 0.02 meters, we can calculate the number of pieces (n) for each shirt as follows:
n = Original length / Length per piece

For Salman's shirt: n = 7.70 / x
For Madina's shirt: n = 3.26 / x

Step 4: Equate the number of pieces since both shirts should have the same number of pieces after being cut into pieces with equal length 'x'.

\begin{align*}
n & = \frac{7.70}{x} \\
& = \frac{3.26}{x}

""What number should replace * in 202* so that the resulting number is a perfect square?""

2. Detailed step-by-step solution with explanations:
To find a digit to replace * such that 202* is a perfect square, we need to first determine what numbers around 202 would make it a perfect square.

A. We can list the squares of integers around the square root of 202:
√202 ≈ 14.2. Therefore, we consider checking the squares of 14 and 15 as their squares will be closest to our target number.
- 14^2 = 196
- 15^2 = 225

B. Comparing these perfect squares with 202, we observe that 225 is the only one in close proximity and slightly greater. Therefore, it seems plausible to try replacing * with a number that would allow us to get close the middle value of something like 204x, where x might lead us back to a perfect square when added to 176 (since 202 + 3 = 205, approximately halfway between two squares 196 and 225).

C. Let's consider the number 'x' that fits between these two consecutive squares:
202 + x = y^2 - y^2 + x = 0.25 + x - 0.25 = (y - 0.5)^2
Where y^2 approximates our target value closer to a perfect square.

D. Simplifying this, we determine that:
(y - 0.5)^2 = (15 - 0.5)^2 = 196 + 3/4 + x = 225
Then substitute the missing value in place of * with '3' to yield a perfect square.

   ""The number of children (y) that satisfy this growth must be rounded upwards to maintain an integer population.""

2. Problem and Solution Explanation:
   The current population is found by applying the 12% growth rate to last year's population of 750.
   Starting population equation: $P_0 = 750$
   Growth rate equation: $Growth = \frac{12}{100}$

   The new equation becomes $P_1 = P_0 * (1 + Growth)$ or $P_1 = 750 * 1.12$. Let's calculate the number of new residents:

   $$ Increase\ in\ Population = 750 * 0.12 = 90 (rounded\ value)$$

   $$ New Population = P_0 + Increase = 750 + 90 = 840$$

   ""Gold is 19.3 times heavier than water. A rectangular gold bar has a length of 7.8 cm, width of 6.4 cm, and height of 2.5 cm. What is the weight of the gold bar in grams?""

2. Solution:
   First, we need to calculate the volume of the gold bar using its dimensions:
   Volume = Length x Width x Height
   Substituting the given values:
   Volume = 7.8 cm x 6.4 cm x 2.5 cm = 120.32 cm³

   Next, we convert the volume from cubic centimeters to cubic millimeters since gold is denser than water and their weights will be compared in grams:
   1 cm³ → 1000 mm³ (given)
   Therefore, Volume = 120.32 cm³ x 1000 mm³/cm³ = 120,320 mm³

   Now, we have to calculate the weight of the gold bar. We know that gold is 19.3 times heavier than water and that the density of water is 550 kg/m³ (or approximately 550 g/cm³ since 1 cm³ = 1g). Thus, the density of gold must be:
   Density of Gold = Density of Water x 19.3
   Substituting the given value:
   Density of Gold ≈ 550 g/cm³ x 19.3 ≈ 10665 g/cm³

   Applying the volume and density to find the weight:
   Weight = Volume x Denisty of Gold
   Substituting the values we have:
   Weight ≈ 120,320 mm³ x 10665g/cm³ (since mm³ is equivalent to cm³)
   ≈ 1,296,893 grams

In conclusion, the weight of the gold bar is approximately:

Also, the ratio of Salman to Ifsuf's income is 4:5. Sohail's income is 120 Takas, so what is Ifsuf's income?

2. **Solution:**
   We have two ratios here. The first ratio is between Salman and Sohail, which can be represented as:
      \[ \dfrac{Salman}{Sohail} = \dfrac{5}{7} \]
     Given that Sohail's income is 120 Takas, we can write Salman’s income (`x`) in terms of Sohail's known value:
      \[ x = 120 * \left(\frac{5}{7}\right) \]
   Next, the ratio between Salman and Ifsuf is:
      \[ \dfrac{Salman}{Ifsuf} = \dfrac{4}{5} \]
     We have now found Salman's income (`x`) from above equation as `120 * (5/7)`. So we can find Ifsuf’s income(`y`) with this ratio and the value of Salman’s income:
      \[ x = 120 * \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)\]
      \[ y = 120 * \left(\frac{5}{7}\right) * \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \]
    Simplifying this would be:
      \[ y = 60 * \left(\frac{5*4}{7*1}\right) \]
      \[ y = 240 / 7 \approx 34.29\]

   However, it seems my calculations might not be right as the multiplication isn't matching and I cannot conclude based on the given data above only. It appears that I lack the correct Salman to Ifsuf ratio that includes Salman's actual value in terms of Sohail's known income, which is derived first.

   **Revised Calculation:**
    Assuming we correct our approach:

""We have a bamboo stick of length 2 meters, and we painted a part of it red that is 75 decimeters (0.75 meters) long. The remaining part was left unpainted. What is the ratio of the total length of the stick to the length painted in red?""

2. Step-by-step solution:
   - Convert the total length of the bamboo stick from meters to decimeters (cm) to make calculations easier: 2 meters = 200 decimeters.
   - Calculate the remaining unpainted length by subtracting the painted red portion from the total length: 200 decimeters - 75 decimeters = 125 decimeters.
   - Now we have the red part (75 decimeters) and the unpainted white part (125 decimeters). Add them together to obtain the full length in decimeters: 75 decimeters + 125 decimeters = 200 decimeters.
   - To find the ratio of the total length to the red-painted length, divide both quantities by their common measure (75 decimeters) and compare the results:
     Ratio = (Total Length / Red Painted Length) = (200 / 75).
