2. Let's denote the numerator as N and the denominator as D. From the two pieces of information provided:

- N + D = 14 (Equation 1)
   - N - D = 8 (Equation 2)

3. To solve for N and D, first multiply Equation 1 by 2 to align it with the difference operation in Equation 2:

- 2(N + D) = 2 * 14   =>   2N + 2D = 28   (Equation 3)

4. Now subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:

- (2N + 2D) - (N - D) = 28 - 8   =>   2N + 2D - N + D = 20

5. Simplify the equation to find the value of N:

- N + 3D = 20   =>   N = 20 - 3D

6. In Equation 1, substitute this new expression for N back into it to solve for D:

- (20 - 3D) + D = 14   =>   20 - 2D = 14
   =>   2D = 6   =>   D = 3

7. Plug the value of D back into Equation 1 to find N:

- N + 3 = 14   =>   N = 11

8. The fraction we were looking for has a numerator of 11 and a denominator of 3. Write the final answer in the given format:

Translation of the Bengali problem into English: There are 1071 kaftans, 595 shirts, and 357 jama bags available. These items are equally distributed among some families. Each family will receive a certain number of each item, including jama bags.

2. To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of items that are being distributed, which is:

Total Items = Kaftans + Shirts + Jamas bag
= 1071 + 595 + 357
Total Items = 2023

Assuming that each family receives an equal share of these items and no item is left over, we can calculate the number of jama bags received by each family by dividing the total number of jama bags by the number of families, which is:

Number of Families = Total Items / (Kaftans + Shirts)
= 2023 / (1071 + 595)
Number of Families = 2023 / 1666
Number of Families = 1

Since the total number of items is exactly equal to the sum of kaftans and shirts, there is only one family receiving these items. Consequently, each family will receive all 357 jama bags available:

2. To solve this problem, we need to understand a few basics about work and time. The formula is: Work = Rate * Time. In this case, the work is constructing the embankment, and the rate is workers per day.

The rate can be found by dividing the number of workers (40) by the number of days (35), which gives 40/35 = 1.1429 workers per day approximately.

Then, we want to find out how many workers (W) are needed in 28 days to complete the same amount of work. We use the formula: 28 * W = 35 * 40, as the amount of work doesn't change. Solving for W gives W = (35 * 40) / 28 = 51.79 workers approximately.

Since we can't have a fraction of a worker, we round up to the nearest whole number because even if there's the slightest doubt, it's always better to add more. Therefore, approximately 52 workers would be required to complete that part of the embankment in 28 days.

2. To find the total cost for paving the path:
First, calculate the area covered by the path. As it surrounds a square garden, its shape can be described as a square ring (with additional overlap at the corners). The external dimensions of this ring are 84m x 64m, and the internal dimensions are 80m x 60m.

The problem states that a group of friends brought some lenses and biscuits to the garden, and each friend brought a certain number of lenses (let's denote it as L) and twice that number of biscuits (2L). The total number of lenses and biscuits they brought together is 147. How many friends were there in total?

The problem is looking for the total number of friends who brought the items based on the information provided.

2. To solve this, let's denote the number of friends as F. Each friend brought L lenses and 2L biscuits, so they each brought a total of L + 2L = 3L items. Therefore, we have:

F * 3L = 147

We need to find an integer value for F that satisfies this equation. Since the problem doesn't provide a specific number for L, we can assume different values for F and check if the multiples of 3 (since 3L must be a multiple of 3) result in 147.

Checking possible integer values:
   - If F = 1, then 3 * 1L = 3 != 147
   - If F = 2, then 3 * 2L = 6L = 147, which gives us L = 24.5. This is not an integer value for L, so it's not a valid solution.
   - If F = 3, then 3 * 3L = 9L != 147
   - Continue this process until the correct value of F is found such that 147/F results in an integer divisible by 3.

After checking the possible values:
   - If F = 49, then 3 * 49L = 147L = 147, which gives us L = 1. This fits all conditions of the problem.

2. To find the price of each pen, let's calculate systematically. Let 'n' be the cost of one notebook, and 'p' the cost of one pen. Then we set up these two equations based on the provided information:
   \[
   15n + 10p = 300 \tag{1}
   \]
   \[
   10n + 15p = 250 \tag{2}

3. To solve these equations, first, we can multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 3 to facilitate elimination of 'n':
   \[
   (15n + 10p) \cdot 2 = 300 \cdot 2 \Rightarrow 30n + 20p = 600 \tag{3}
   \]
   \[
   (10n + 15p) \cdot 3 = 250 \cdot 3 \Rightarrow 30n + 45p = 750 \tag{4}

4. Now, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):
   \[
   45p - 20p = 750 - 600 \Rightarrow 25p = 150 \Rightarrow p = 150 / 25 = 6

The area of one road can be calculated as its length multiplied by its width. So, for a single road, the area would be \(40 \times 1.5\) square meters.
However, since there are two such roads running across the field and they intersect at the middle so their areas will not overlap entirely. To find the total area of both roads, we simply add these areas together:

Area of one road = \(40 \times 1.5\) square meters
Area of another road = \(40 \times 1.5\) square meters

Total area for both roads = Area of first road + Area of second road
= \(40 \times 1.5 + 40 \times 1.5\)

""A car's front wheel has a circumference of 14 decimeters, and the rear wheel has a circumference of 35 decimeters. How far at least can one travel so that both wheels turn an exact number of times?""

2. To find out how far one must travel for both wheels to turn an exact number of times (i.e., having both wheels turning a whole number of revolutions), we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two circumferences, which are 14 decimeters and 35 decimeters respectively.

Considering the numbers 14 and 35:
- Divide 35 by 14, and the remainder is 7; hence 35 - 14 = 21.
- Divide 21 by 14; there is no remainder. Thus, the largest number that evenly divides both circumferences is 7 (the GCD).

Therefore, to account for this common divisor in our travels so as not to lose sync between wheels turning a whole number of times, we multiply the smaller circumference by some variable ""x"", keeping the result an integer:
14 * x = n * 35 (where 'n' is any integer) such that both sides are equal.

From our GCD calculation, x=7 and n=2 since:
- (14 * 14 (i.e., 196)) ÷ 35 = 5 remainder 21. This means we multiply 14 by itself to find n, and divide the result by 35 which leaves a whole number of revolutions for both wheels.
- (2 * 14) = 35 fits our equation, thus, n=2. Therefore, x should be at least (2 + 0.667) times the smaller circumference to cover at least a distance enough for both wheel to turn an exact number of circles.

Translation of the problem into English: A shopkeeper buys 50 kg of rice at a price of 1600 rupees per bag and sells it for 1500 rupees each after the price drop. How many rupees did he incur a loss?
2. The shopkeeper initially bought 50 kg of rice at a cost of 1600 rupees. Assuming that's the price per bag, we need to calculate how much it would cost him to sell this amount of rice for 1500 rupees each. Since he is selling in bags and assuming a linear relationship between price change, if the price per bag drops from 1600 rupees to 1500 rupees, then the loss per bag is calculated as follows:

   Loss per bag = Original price - New price
                = 1600 - 1500
                = 100 rupees

3. Now, we must calculate the total loss incurred by selling all 50 kg of rice at the new price.

   Total quantity = 50 kg
   Loss per kg (assuming one bag weighs one unit less than 50 kg and loss applies to one full bag's weight difference) = Loss per bag / Weight in kilograms per bag. Assuming one kg per bag, Loss per kg = 100 / 50.
   Thus, the total loss for selling a full bag of rice is equivalent to (since each kilogram lost means a smaller quantity sold) the same amount above calculated: 100 rupees as the loss has already been spread per kilogram of rice.

4. Consequently, we don't actually need to compute this further; it seems the total value has effectively dropped by one full price calculation made from selling the product at a discounted rate: Total loss = 1 (since only one unit, or bag) has experienced price variation and was computed above.

Translation of the problem into English: A shopkeeper buys 50 kg of rice at a price of 1600 rupees per bag and sells it for 1500 rupees each after the price drop. How many rupees did he incur a loss?\n2. The shopkeeper initially bought 50 kg of rice at a cost of 1600 rupees. Assuming that's the price per bag, we need to calculate how much it would cost him to sell this amount of rice for 1500 rupees each. Since he is selling in bags and assuming a linear relationship between price change, if the price per bag drops from 1600 rupees to 1500 rupees, then the loss per bag is calculated as follows:\n\n   Loss per bag = Original price - New price\n                = 1600 - 1500\n                = 100 rupees\n\n3.

    - For instance, let's try the smallest gap we can subtract: 1. The difference would be 5605-1 = 5604, which could indeed be a perfect square like 74^2 given that our guess would hold, however we would need to verify if there's another case of integer squares below this number and smaller than the intended minimum which we would have to check as follows:

Now let's check if this is indeed a perfect square by taking two consecutive integers around its square root: sqrt(5589) approximates to 74, and we calculate 73^2= 5329, while 74^2 = 5476, so clearly both of these do not fit our equation yet.

Now try if this is indeed a perfect square by taking two consecutive integers around its square root: sqrt(5524) approximates to 74, and here we find that actually these are right as our number should have been the perfect square which in our check above of smaller perfect squares didn't show up.

Let's check if this is a square: sqrt(5556) approximates to 74, and by calculating 73^2 =5329 & 75^2 =5606 neither fit our equation yet.\n    - Subtract 81 (as it's the square of 9): 5605-81=5524. Now try if this is indeed a perfect square by taking two consecutive integers around its square root: sqrt(5524) approximates to 74, and here we find that actually these are right as our number should have been the perfect square which in our check above of smaller perfect squares didn't show up.\n    - Therefore, subtracting 81 yields a perfect square.\n4.

2. Solve the problem in English:
   - Let's denote Gita's amount of money as G, Shihab's amount as S, and Shimul's amount as M.
   - From the problem, we know that M = 420 Rs (Shimul's money).
   - We also know that M = G + 350 (Gita has Rs.350 less than Shimul) and S = G + 210 (Shihab has Rs.210 more than Gita).

Now we have two equations:
M = G + 350
S = G + 210

Since M = 420, substitute M in the first equation to find G:
420 = G + 350 => G = 70 Rs (Gita's money).

Now use G's value to find S from the second equation:
S = 70 + 210 => S = 280 Rs.

""What is the amount of profit that would be made in 10 years with an interest rate of 5% on a principal amount of 10,000 Takas?""

2. Solving the problem:
To calculate this, we use the formula for simple interest, A = P(1 + rt), where:
A = the amount after time t
P = the principal amount (the initial sum)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal form)
t = time in years

In this case, P = 10,000 Takas, r = 5% = 0.05, and t = 10 years.

A = 10,000 * (1 + 0.05 * 10)
A = 10,000 * (1 + 0.5)
A = 10,000 * 1.5
A = 15,000 Takas

The amount after 10 years would be 15,000 Takas. To find the profit, we subtract the principal:

Profit = A - P

A tea trader buys 1 kg of tea leaves at a price of 80 Takas per kg and sells it all at a price of 75 Takas per kg, resulting in a loss of 500 Takas. How many kg of tea leaves did he buy?
2. Solve the mathematical problem:
Let's denote the cost price per kg as CP = 80 Takas and selling price per kg as SP = 75 Takas. Let the quantity of tea leaves bought be Q kg. So, the total buying amount would be: (Q * CP)
The selling amount can be represented by: (Q * SP). In this scenario, we are given that the trader incurs a loss of 500 Takas. We know that Loss = Total Buying Amount - Total Selling Amount, hence the equation becomes:
(Q * CP) - (Q * SP) = Loss
Substitute the given values into the equation:
(Q * 80) - (Q * 75) = 500
Now we simplify:
3Q = 500
Divide both sides by 3 to solve for Q:
Q = 500/3
Hence, the trader bought (166.67) kilograms of tea leaves.

    ""The net income increased from 8% to 10%. As a result, Tisha Marmar's earnings grew by 128 Takas in just 4 years. How much was her initial capital?""

2. Solution Process:
    Let \( P \) be Tisha Marmar’s initial capital (principal amount). She earns an interest of 8% initially, and her income increases after some time to a rate of 10%. The additional income received over the period is given as 128 Takas. We want to find out the principal \( P \) that she had.

Given:
- Annual interest increase = \( 10\% - 8\% = 2\% \)
- Increase of 2% per annum for 4 years equals an additional income of 128 Takas over those four years.

The total additional amount earned (128 Takas) can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Total Extra Income} = P \times r \times t \]

Where,
- \( r = 2\% \) per annum for 4 years gives an annual extra income rate of \(0.02\), 
- \( t = 4 \) years,
\[ P \times 0.02 \times 4 = 128 \]
\[ 0.08 \times P = 128 \]
\[ P = \frac{128}{0.08} \]
\[ P = 1600 \]

Translate the Bengali problem into English: A rectangular house has a perimeter that is equal to a square's side length. The length of the rectangular house is three times its width. It costs 75 rupees to dye one square meter of carpet for the house, and a total expenditure of 11025 rupees was spent on it. How many tiles of size 40 cm x 40 cm will be required to tile the house's square area?

2. Solve:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the length and width of the rectangular house:
   a) Let L represent the length and W represent the width. We know that L = 3W.
   b) The perimeter is given by P = 2(L + W). However, since it's equal to the square's side length (S), we can say P = S, which implies 2(L + W) = S.
   c) Substitute L = 3W into the equation obtained in step b: 2((3W) + W) = S or 8W = S.
   d) The number of square meters covered by the house can be found using the formula Area = Length * Width, or Area = (S^2)/9 since L = 3W and therefore S = 8W.
   e) Using this information, we calculate Area = (S^2)/9 = ((7W)^2)/9 = 49W^2/9. Since it costs 11025 rupees to cover the area, we can determine the cost per square meter (75 rupees) and set up an equation: 49 W^2/9 * 75 = 11025 => W^2 = 225 => W = 15.
   f) Now that we have W, we can find L again: L = 3W = 3*(15) = 45 meters. This means the house's side length is S = 8*15/3 = 60 meters (the length of the square).

   Monira Begum took loans at a rate of 6% and 4%, respectively, to meet her family's needs. She took a total loan amounting to 560,000 Taka, and ultimately earned a profit of 2840 Taka after repayments. If a 5% profit applies to the entire loan, what would be the annual profit?

2. To find the annual profit:
   Let's first determine the total principal amount borrowed by Monira Begum. We know that she earned profits of 2840 Taka after repaying a portion of the loan at different interest rates. If we assume she had the same outstanding balance for each year, we can calculate the effective annual rate from the provided information:
   
   Total loan= Principal P1 (6%)+Principal P2 (4%)
   Total loan= 560,000 Taka

   Given profit: Principal P1 (6%) + Principal P2 (4%) = 2840 Taka
   
   Now we need to calculate the effective interest rate and annual earnings using present value of money concepts.
   Let's assume that 'n' is the number of years she took the loan for. So, each year she paid (6+4/17%*P)*(n) of the initial 560,000 Taka plus interest.

   The present value of the payments can be represented as:
   PV = [6%/(1-(1-6%)^(3*1)) + 4/(1-(1-4%)^(2*2))]*P_initial
   2840 Taka= .56*(762,000 Taka)
   
   Solving for annual earnings:
   
   5% of (560,000 Taka)*(1-(1+p)^(n))= 1000-2840/2

   Adhunath Bidhyamandir School's class sixth students were given seedlings by the principal to plant in the school garden. It was calculated that if these seedlings are planted in 20, 24 or 30 rows, then each row will have an equal number of seedlings. The principal sent at least how many seedlings?

2. Solve the problem:
   To find out the minimum number of seedlings the principal could have sent, we need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20, 24, and 30 as this will give us the maximum number of rows that can be evenly filled without any remainder.

The prime factors of the numbers are:
   - 20 = 2^2 * 5
   - 24 = 2^3 * 3
   - 30 = 2 * 3 * 5

The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of common prime factors. So, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20, 24, and 30 is: 2 (as it's the only common factor and its minimum power in all three numbers).

But if the principal sent just 2 seedlings per row, that would amount to less than one set for each student. So we must consider the next highest number divisible by these numbers, which is given by their least common multiple (LCM).

The LCM of 20, 24, and 30 can be calculated by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
   - 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 360.

Hence, the principal sent at least 360 seedlings as it is divisible by each of the row counts (20, 24, and 30) without remainder, ensuring equal distribution among students in each scenario.

""There is a stick such that 1/2 of it is in the mud, 1/3 of it in water, and the remaining part above the water. The length of the part above the water is 3 meters. What is the length of the stick in the water?""

2. Solution steps:
Let's denote the total length of the stick as L meters. According to the problem, we have two main parts of the stick, one half submerged in mud and one third underwater. The remaining part is the portion above the water, which has a length of 3 meters. To find out how much of the stick is in the water, let's first figure out the fractions of the stick lengths:

Half of the stick = L/2
One-third of the stick above the water = (L-L/2)/2 = L/4

Since we know that the portion above water has a length of 3 meters, the equation will be:

(L/2) - H = 3, where H is the remaining part above water.

To find H, solve for H:
H = (L/4) - 3

Since H must be positive, we know that L has to be greater than three times the length of the portion above water:

L > 3*3
L > 9

Now we can determine the length of the stick in the water. It's one-third of the entire stick (since half is in mud and an additional one-sixth must be above):

Water length = L/6

We know that L > 9, so let's check if a stick with the minimal sufficient length still satisfies the given conditions:

If L=10m, then H=(L/4)-3 = (2.5-3)=-0.5 which is not possible as above water part cannot be negative. Thus, L must be at least 9 meters more. Let's assume a larger value for simplicity:

Water length = (L=12m) / 6 = 2m approximately meets the given conditions with half in mud, one-third in water and the remaining 3 meters above water.

2. The problem states that the product of two positive integers is 162 and their quotient (the result of dividing the larger number by the smaller) is 2. We need to find these two numbers.
3. Let x be the smaller number and y be the larger number. Therefore, we have two equations:
   xy = 162 (Equation 1)
   y/x = 2 (Equation 2)
4. Since we know that their quotient is 2, we can deduce that the larger number is twice the smaller number: y = 2x
5. Now substitute this into Equation 1: 
   2x * x = 162
   2x^2 = 162
   Divide both sides by 2: x^2 = 81
   Take the square root of both sides: x = 9
6. Now we know that x is 9, we can find y by substituting x (9) into the equation y = 2x: y = 2*9 = 18

The problem is about two groups, one with 8 members and another with 10 members, who want to form a theater group. The question asks for the minimum number of common members between these two groups so that both types of groups can be formed.

2. Solve the mathematical reasoning problem:
Let's denote the common members as ""x"". In order to form both types of groups (8-member and 10-member groups), we need at least two overlapping members between the groups, so that one person from each overlap can be part of both groups. However, we still need more people to create all possible combinations.

To satisfy both group formations minimally, we need an additional ""x"" common members plus 2 individual members (who are not part of any group yet) for the remaining positions in either 8-member or 10-member groups.

So the equation would be: x + 2 = Total Members Required

Therefore, if we take the lowest possible values to satisfy the conditions mentioned, let's assume x (common members) = 1 and 2 (individual members). This results in a total of 3 people that must exist within each group type.

Translate the Bengali problem into English: There are two empty pots in a quadrilateral pot. The first and second pots can fill the empty quadrilateral pot completely in 12 hours and 18 hours respectively. If both pots are opened together, how many hours does it take to fill the empty quadrilateral pot?

2. To find the rate at which each pot fills the common container, we can calculate the rate as follows:
   - The first pot has a filling time of 12 hours, so its rate is 1/12 pots per hour.
   - The second pot has a filling time of 18 hours, so its rate is 1/18 pots per hour.
   Combined, the two pots together fill at a rate of (1/12 + 1/18) pots per hour.

3. Finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators:
   - The LCM of 12 and 18 is 72.
   
4. Combining the rates by adding the fractions with a common denominator:
   - (6/72 + 4/72) = 10/72 pots per hour, which simplifies to 5/36 pots per hour.

5. Calculating how long it takes both pots working together to fill one pot:
   - Time taken = 1 / (combined rate)
   - Time taken = 1 / (5/36) hours

The first and second pots can fill the empty quadrilateral pot completely in 12 hours and 18 hours respectively. If both pots are opened together, how many hours does it take to fill the empty quadrilateral pot?\n\n2. To find the rate at which each pot fills the common container, we can calculate the rate as follows:\n   - The first pot has a filling time of 12 hours, so its rate is 1/12 pots per hour.\n   - The second pot has a filling time of 18 hours, so its rate is 1/18 pots per hour.\n   Combined, the two pots together fill at a rate of (1/12 + 1/18) pots per hour.\n\n3.

Rajib, Debangana, Masum and Tajmira together can count 150 items in 6 days. If each one counts equally every day, how many days will Rajib and Tajmira need to count 250 items?

2. Solve the problem:
The total count of 150 items divided by 4 people (Rajib, Debangana, Masum, and Tajmira) means each person counts 37.5 items per day collectively.
Now, if we think of the process in reverse, Rajib and Tajmira alone would need to count twice as much because there are only two of them (250 items divided by 2). So if they had counted at the same rate, they would have taken:
`37.5 * 2 = 75`
75 times per day but since it's an integer number of complete days needed, we can conclude that each one needs to adjust their individual counting count by half a unit to make this divisible and feasible in whole days. Therefore, Rajib and Tajmima will take `(2 * 75) / 38 = 3.97...` or approximately `4` full days.

However, if the number of items each person counts per day is not changed, we can calculate based on the original rate:
Calculate the total amount Rajib and Tajmira together can count in one day, which would be 20 because they are two people out of four. Then divide this by 3 (because 250 divided by the initial number, 150/6 is 3). This gives `16.67` days approximately around `17` days with a proper integer rounding.

The problem is about understanding and calculating the rate at which tractors can plough land (in bighas per day) and then using that rate to determine how many tractors are required for a different task.

To find the rate of one tractor, we need to calculate the number of bighas it can plough in one day: 360 acres / (4 tractors * 20 days) = 45 bighas per day.

Now that we know each tractor can plough 45 bighas in a day, we need to find out how many tractors it would take for one hundred more bighas in only half the time (10 instead of 20 days).

We set up the equation: 1800 acres / (Number of Tractors * 10 days) = 45 bighas per day and solve for the number of tractors (#T):

Three small tanks contain respectively 35 liters, 56 liters and 84 liters of oil. We need to calculate the maximum capacity that can be obtained by filling the three tanks a whole number of times with the largest container size each time until no more full containers of that size can be poured in.
2. To determine this, we'll start by considering each tank separately and see how many times we can fill them completely with the largest oil volume available (i.e., 84 liters). Afterwards, this will help us choose an appropriate measuring cup.
3. Calculating for Tank 1: 35/84 = 0.419 (approximately) -> we can't fully fill it with 84-liter containers. Therefore, Tank 1 does not give us any information about the optimal size of the measuring cup yet.
4. Calculating for Tank 2: 56/84 = 0.667 (approximately) -> we can't fully fill it with 84-liter containers either, so still no help for finding the oil container volume.
5. However, when adding up the volumes of all tanks together: 35 + 56 + 84 = 175 liters, we already know that the largest container must be at least as big as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 35, 56, and possibly 84 to perfectly fill the tanks.
6. Applying Euclidean Algorithm for GCD:
- First two numbers are 35 and 56; their difference is 21.
- 56 modulo 21 = 0, so we use 21 instead of 35 from now on.
- Then find the GCD(21, 84) by subtracting the smaller number (which is 21) repeatedly from the larger one (in steps of 21) until they are equal: 84 - 4 x 21 = 0.
7. Thus, the greatest common divisor (gcd) is 21 liters. Hence, 21-liters is a suitable container size to pour oil into each tank completely multiple times and will never leave behind any fractions of the containers.

   ""If the annual rate of interest is X% per annum, then how much money will be invested annually to make a profit of 13000 units in 5 years?""

2. To simplify this problem, let's denote the annual rate of interest as 'r'. We are given that 13000 is a lump sum amount for an investment with an X% annual interest rate over 5 years, resulting in twice the initial investment (doubling). Thus, we can use the doubling time formula to solve for r:
   
   A = P(1 + r)^n
   2P = P(1 + r)^5
   2 = (1 + r)^5
   2^(1/5) = 1 + r
   2^(1/5) - 1 ≈ 0.1487 ≈ 14.87%
   
   Converting it to an annual percentage:
   6 * 14.87% = 89.22%, which is the required interest rate for the investment.

3. Now, we know that if Rs. 1 lakh was invested yearly at 89.22% annually over five years, it would double. Thus, to find out how much money will be invested annually, it should still be a multiple of Rs. 1 lakh as per the problem statement.
   
   To make Rs. 5 million after investing annually for a 5-year period at an interest rate calculated earlier (89.22%), multiplying to achieve that is as simple as doubling 130,000 units 4 times. So, Rs. 5 million can be invested annually to make the profit of Rs. 5 million in 5 years with a 14.87% annual interest rate.

Translation: A person borrows 50,000 Taka from a lending institution with an annual interest rate of 8%. Each year, he pays off 2,000 Taka. After two payments, how much loan will remain?

2. Let's denote the remaining debt after two years as D.

The principal amount P is 50,000 Taka, and the interest rate r is 8%. The person pays off a portion of P each year, which we denote as C (2,000 Taka). We need to find the value of D after two payments.

We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate the remaining debt:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where A is the final amount (debt), P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), n is the number of times that interest applied per year (which we'll assume is 1 for simplicity), and t is the time the money is invested for.

First, let's calculate the debt after the first payment:

A1 = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
A1 = (50,000)(1 + 0.08/1)^(1*1)
A1 ≈ 54,000 Taka (remaining debt after the first payment)

The person pays off 2,000 Taka:
Debt after first payment = A1 - C = 54,000 - 2000 ≈ 52,000 Taka.

Now let's calculate the debt after the second payment:

A2 = D(1 + r/n)^(nt)
A2 = (52,000)(1 + 0.08/1)^(1*1)
A2 ≈ 57,760 Taka (remaining debt after the second payment)

2. Conduct calculations: First, let's find the possible lengths S could obtain by cutting the Beguni rope into equal pieces with a total length difference of 0.02 meters. Let x be the length of one piece. Then the sum of the two longest pieces would be X + (X - 0.02) = 2X - 0.02. We are given that this sum is equal to the length of the shortest possible piece, which is the Beguni rope's original length minus one piece's length:

7.70 = 2X - X + 0.02 => X = 3.68

Therefore, there are two pieces with a length of 3.68m and eight pieces (total length difference/piece length) with a length of approximately 3.68 + (3.68 * 7.62) / 8 = 3.68m + 0.01542m ≈ 3.69542m (approx).

To determine what digit replaces the '*' in the number 202* to make it a perfect square, we need to consider the options for the last digit of a perfect square. The last digits of perfect squares are either 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Since 202 ends in 2 and we're looking to make the entire number a perfect square, the digit replacing '*' should be one that, when placed at the end of 202, would result in the number having one of those last digits.

We quickly try a few options:
- If 2026 is a possible option, but it is not, since 2026 is divisible by both 2 and 43 (not prime itself).

The gold bar is 19.3 times heavier than water. The dimensions of a square gold bar are length = 7.8 cm, width = 6.4 cm, and height = 2.5 cm. What is the weight of this gold bar in grams?

2. To find the weight of the gold bar, we need to calculate its volume first and then multiply it by the density ratio (gold to water).
   - Gold is approximately 19.3 times heavier than water, so we assume its relative density to be 19.3 when compared to water.
   - The formula for the volume of a cubic shape is: V = length × width × height
     V = 7.8 cm × 6.4 cm × 2.5 cm
     V = 122.56 cubic centimeters

3. Now, we need to multiply this volume by the relative density (gold to water):
Weight of gold bar (in grams) can be found out using the formula:
   Weight in Grams = Volume × Relative Density × 1 gram/mL for comparison purpose.
   In this case, since we're comparing it to water, assume that 1 mL of water has a weight of 1 gram and so,
     Weight in Grams = Volume × Relative Density
     Weight in Grams = 122.56 cm² × 19.3 g/cm³

Salman and Ifsof's earnings are in the ratio of 4:5. If Solaiman earns 120 Takas, what is Ifsof's earnings?

2. Solution: Let's denote Solaiman's earnings as ""S"" and Salman's earnings as ""Sa"". We know that S = 120 Takas and the ratio of S to Sa is 5:7. So, we can write this relation as:
   S/Sa = 5/7

   We want to find Ifsof's earnings (denoted as ""I""). The problem gives us another ratio for Salman and Ifsof:
   Sa/I = 4/5

   Now, we can manipulate these two equations together to get the relation of S to I. Divide equation 1 by equation 2:
   (S/Sa) / (Sa/I) = (5/7) / (4/5)

   Solve for S in terms of I:
   S = (5/7)*(4/5)*I
   S = (4/7)*I

   Substitute the given value of S as 120 Takas:
   120 = (4/7)*I

   Finally, solve for I (Ifsof's earnings):
   I = 120 * (7/4) = 210 Takas.
