Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine. Hmm, I remember that fluorine is a diatomic molecule, which means it exists as F₂. So, the molecular weight of F₂ is about 38 g/mol because each fluorine atom has an atomic weight of 19 g/mol, right? So when we're dealing with 1 mole of F₂, it's 38 grams. But the question is about 19 moles, so I should multiply 38 grams by 19 to get the total molecular weight. Wait, let me double-check the atomic weight of fluorine to make sure it's 19 g/mol. Yes, that's correct. So, 38 multiplied by 19 should give the answer. Let me do that calculation: 38 * 19 is 722. So, the molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine as F₂ is 722 grams. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took.
</think>

The problem asks for the molecular weight of 19 moles of fluorine. 

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The chemical symbol for fluorine is F.
   - Fluorine is a diatomic element, meaning it naturally exists as F₂ molecules.
   - The atomic weight of fluorine (F) is approximately 19 g/mol.

2. **Calculating Molecular Weight:**
   - Since fluorine forms diatomic molecules (F₂), the molecular weight of one mole of F₂ is:
     \[
     2 \times 19 \, \text{g/mol} = 38 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
   - For 19 moles of fluorine (F₂):
     \[
     19 \, \text{moles} \times 38 \, \text{g/mol} = 722 \, \text{grams}
     \]

First, I need to translate the problem from Bengali to English to ensure I understand the given values. The problem states that a circle has a diameter of 2 cm and a chord length of 8 cm. I need to find the central angle in radians corresponding to this chord.

Next, I'll use the formula that relates chord length (c), the radius (r), and the central angle in radians (θ): c = 2r * sin(θ/2). 

Since the diameter is 2 cm, the radius (r) will be half of that, which is 1 cm.

Now, substituting the known values into the formula: 8 = 2 * 1 * sin(θ/2).

Simplifying the equation: sin(θ/2) = 4. 

However, the maximum value of sin(θ/2) is 1, so this equation has no real solution. This implies that a chord of 8 cm in a circle with a diameter of 2 cm is not possible because the chord length cannot exceed the diameter of the circle.

Therefore, there is no valid central angle that satisfies the given conditions.

**Translation of the problem:**
A circle with a diameter of 2 cm has an 8 cm long chord at the center. What radian angle does this chord hold at the center?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Diameter (D)** of the circle = 2 cm
   - **Chord Length (c)** = 8 cm
   - We need to find the **central angle (θ)** in **radians**.

2. **Calculate the Radius:**
   The radius (r) of the circle is half of the diameter:
   \[
   r = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Use the Chord Length Formula:**
   The formula relating chord length (c), radius (r), and central angle (θ) in radians is:
   \[
   c = 2r \cdot \sin\left(\frac{θ}{2}\right)
   \]

Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, I need to translate the Bengali problem into English:

**""A circle has a diameter of 5 cm. Find the measure of the central angle in radians for a 15 cm long arc in the circle.""**

Now, let's determine the central angle corresponding to the 15 cm arc.

1. **Calculate the Circumference (C) of the Circle:**
   - Diameter (d) = 5 cm
   - Circumference (C) = π × d = π × 5 cm = 5π cm

2. **Determine the Fraction of the Circle Represented by the Arc Length:**
   - Arc length (s) = 15 cm
   - Fraction of circumference = s / C = 15 cm / 5π cm = 3 / π

3. **Convert the Fraction to Radians:**
   - Since the entire circle is 2π radians, multiply the fraction by 2π:
   - Central angle (θ) = (3 / π) × 2π = 6 radians

Thus, the central angle is 6 radians.

**Problem Translated into English:**
A circle has a diameter of 5 cm. Find the measure of the central angle in radians for a 15 cm long arc in the circle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Find the Radius of the Circle:**

   - Radius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 5 cm / 2 = 2.5 cm

2. **Calculate the Circumference of the Circle:**
   - Circumference (C) = 2 × π × r
   - C = 2 × π × 2.5 cm = 5π cm

Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand it first.

Alright, the problem says: A train starts from rest and accelerates uniformly. It needs to cover a distance of 250 meters to pass a post. I need to find the speed at which the train passes the post, and the acceleration is given as 20 m/s². Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I approach it correctly.

I remember from physics that when dealing with uniformly accelerated motion, we can use the equations of motion. Since the train starts from rest, the initial velocity u is 0. The acceleration a is 20 m/s², and the distance s is 250 meters. I need to find the final velocity v when it has traveled that distance.

The equation I think I should use here is: v² = u² + 2a*s. Yeah, that sounds right because it relates velocity, acceleration, and distance without needing time.

Plugging in the known values: u is 0, a is 20, and s is 250. So, v² = 0 + 2*20*250. Let me calculate that. 2 times 20 is 40, and 40 times 250 is... 40*250 = 10,000. So, v² equals 10,000.

To find v, I take the square root of 10,000, which is 100. So, the velocity when the train passes the post should be 100 m/s.

Wait a second, that seems really fast. 100 meters per second is about 360 km/h, which is much faster than most trains go. Did I do something wrong? Maybe I should double-check the equation. Yes, the equation v² = u² + 2a*s is correct for constant acceleration. Let me recalculate: 20 m/s² times 250 m is 5000, times 2 is 10,000. Square root of 10,000 is definitely 100. Okay, so the calculation seems right, even though the speed is high.

I guess the problem just assumes such a high acceleration. In reality, trains can't accelerate that quickly, but for the sake of the problem, I'll go with it.

So, I think the speed at which the train passes the post is 100 m/s.

First, I recognize that the object is in free fall, meaning its motion is influenced by gravity.

I recall that the distance covered by an object in free fall can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]
where \( S \) is the distance, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( t \) is the time in seconds.

Given that the object covers 72 meters in 6 seconds, I can set up the equation:
\[ 72 = \frac{1}{2} g (6)^2 \]

Solving for \( g \):
\[ 72 = \frac{1}{2} g \times 36 \]
\[ 72 = 18g \]
\[ g = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]

However, I note that the standard acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). The discrepancy suggests I might have made an error in calculation. Rechecking the steps, I realize that plugging in \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) should give the correct distance.

Using the correct value of \( g \):
\[ S = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times (3)^2 \]
\[ S = 4.9 \times 9 \]
\[ S = 44.1 \, \text{meters} \]

Therefore, the distance the object will cover in 3 seconds is approximately 44.1 meters.

**Translation of the Problem:**
An object falls freely. It covers a distance of 72 meters in 6 seconds. How far will it fall in 3 seconds?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Motion:**
   - The object is in free fall, meaning it is under the influence of gravity.
   - The acceleration due to gravity (\( g \)) is constant and approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) near the Earth's surface.
   - The formula for distance covered under constant acceleration is:

     S = \frac{1}{2} g t^2

First, I identify the total number of days in February 2000. February typically has 28 days, but since 2000 is a leap year, it has 29 days.

Next, there are 5 rainy days in total during February 2000.

Assuming that the distribution of rainy days is uniform throughout the month, the probability of rain on any specific day, such as February 12th, can be calculated by dividing the number of rainy days by the total number of days in February.

Therefore, the probability is 5 out of 29 days, which simplifies to approximately 0.1724 or 17.24%.

**Translated Problem:**
In the year 2000, February had 5 rainy days. What is the probability that it rained on February 12th?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Total Number of Days in February 2000:**
   - February normally has 28 days.
   - However, the year 2000 is a leap year. Leap years have 29 days in February because 2000 is divisible by 400 (2000 ÷ 400 = 5, which is an integer).
   - Therefore, February 2000 has **29 days**.

2. **Total Rainy Days:**
   - It is given that there were **5 rainy days** in February 2000.

3. **Assumption:**
   - Assuming that the rainy days are uniformly distributed throughout the month, the probability of rain on any specific day can be considered equal.

4. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability of rain on February 12th is the ratio of rainy days to the total number of days in February.
   - Probability \( P = \frac{\text{Number of Rainy Days}}{\text{Total Number of Days in February}} \)
   - \( P = \frac{5}{29} \)

First, I need to understand the relationship between velocity and distance for an object under uniform acceleration. Since the object is released from rest without any resistance, the acceleration is constant.

I'll use the equation of motion:
v² = u² + 2a s
Given u = 0, this simplifies to:
v² = 2a s

If the distance is quadrupled, the new velocity squared becomes:
(v')² = 2a (4s)

Substituting the original v² into this equation:
(v')² = 4 * 2a s = 4v²

Taking the square root of both sides gives:
v' = 2v

Therefore, the velocity increases by a factor of 2 when the distance is quadrupled.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution in English:**

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Translation:**
When an object is released from rest without any resistance, by how many times will its velocity increase if the distance is quadrupled?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Scenario:**
   - The object starts from rest, so the initial velocity \( u = 0 \).
   - There is no resistance, implying that acceleration \( a \) is constant.
   - We need to relate the final velocity \( v \) to the distance \( s \).

2. **Use the Equation of Motion:**
   The appropriate equation is:
   \[
   v^2 = u^2 + 2a s
   \]
   Since \( u = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   v^2 = 2a s \quad (1)
   \]

3. **Consider the Quadrupled Distance:**
   Let the new distance be \( s' = 4s \).  
   The new velocity will be \( v' \). Applying the same equation:
   \[
   (v')^2 = 2a s' = 2a (4s) = 4 \times 2a s = 4v^2 \quad (2)
   \]
   From equation (1), \( 2a s = v^2 \).

4. **Relate the New Velocity to the Original Velocity:**
   From equation (2):
   \[
   (v')^2 = 4v^2
   \]
   Taking the square root of both sides:

Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage of oxygen in glucose, which is C6H12O6. Hmm, I remember that to find the percentage composition by mass, I should break down each element's contribution. Let's start by finding the molar mass of glucose. 

Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of about 12.01 g/mol, and there are 6 of them in glucose. So 6 times 12.01 is... let's see, 6*12 is 72, and 6*0.01 is 0.06, so together that's 72.06 g/mol for carbon.

Next, hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.008 g/mol. There are 12 hydrogens, so 12*1.008. Let me calculate that: 12*1 is 12, and 12*0.008 is 0.096, so adding those gives me 12.096 g/mol for hydrogen.

Now, oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of about 16.00 g/mol, and there are 6 oxygen atoms in glucose. So 6*16 is 96.00 g/mol for oxygen.

To find the total molar mass of glucose, I add up the masses of all the atoms: 72.06 (carbon) + 12.096 (hydrogen) + 96.00 (oxygen). Let's add those up step by step. 72.06 + 12.096 is 84.156, and then adding 96 gives me 180.156 g/mol total.

Now, since I'm looking for the percentage of oxygen, I take the oxygen's mass (96.00 g/mol) and divide it by the total molar mass of glucose (180.156 g/mol). So that's 96 divided by 180.156. 

Let me do the division: 96 ÷ 180.156. Hmm, that's approximately 0.5329, or 53.29%. Wait, that seems high. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my calculations. Yes, I think the division is correct. So the percentage of oxygen in glucose is about 53.29%.

Next, at 6 rotations per second, the distance traveled per second is 6 × 2.5133 ≈ 15.08 meters per second.

To convert this speed to kilometers per hour, I multiply by 3.6 (since 1 m/s is equivalent to 3.6 km/h):
15.08 × 3.6 ≈ 54.288 km/h.

Rounding this to a reasonable precision, the car's speed is approximately 54.29 km/h.

### Translation of the Problem:
A car wheel has a diameter of **0.8 meters** and rotates **6 times every second**. What is the speed of the car in kilometers per hour?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Circumference of the Wheel**  
   The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:  
   \[
   C = \pi \times \text{diameter}
   \]  
   Here, the diameter is \( 0.8 \) meters.  
   \[
   C = 3.1416 \times 0.8 = 2.5133 \ \text{meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the Distance Traveled in One Second**  
   The wheel rotates \( 6 \) times per second. Therefore, the distance covered in one second is:  
   \[
   \text{Distance per second} = 6 \times C = 6 \times 2.5133 = 15.08 \ \text{meters/second}
   \]

3. **Convert the Speed to Kilometers per Hour**  
   To convert meters per second to kilometers per hour, multiply by \( 3.6 \):  
   \[
   \text{Speed in km/h} = 15.08 \times 3.6 = 54.288 \ \text{kilometers/hour}
   \]  
   Rounding to two decimal places:

Problem:
A metal solid sphere with a radius of 6 cm is melted to form a cylinder of 32 cm height. What is the radius of the resulting cylinder?

Solution:
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a sphere with a radius of 6 cm being melted to form a cylinder.
   - The height of the cylinder is given as 32 cm.
   - We need to find the radius of the cylinder.

2. **Key Concept:**
   - When a solid is melted and recast into another shape, the volume remains constant. Therefore, the volume of the sphere will be equal to the volume of the cylinder.

3. **Volume of the Sphere:**
   - The formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r_{sphere}^3 \).
   - Given: \( r_{sphere} = 6 \) cm.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times 216 = 288\pi \text{ cm}^3
     \]

4. **Volume of the Cylinder:**
   - The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \( V_{cylinder} = \pi r_{cylinder}^2 h \).
   - Given: \( h = 32 \) cm.
   - Since \( V_{sphere} = V_{cylinder} \):
     \[
     288\pi = \pi r_{cylinder}^2 \times 32
     \]

5. **Solve for \( r_{cylinder} \):**
   - Divide both sides by \( \pi \):
     \[
     288 = 32 r_{cylinder}^2
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 32:
     \[
     r_{cylinder}^2 = \frac{288}{32} = 9
     \]
   - Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     r_{cylinder} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \text{ cm}

Okay, so I have this problem here about melting a metal sphere and turning it into a cylinder. The sphere has a radius of 6 cm, and the cylinder is 32 cm tall. I need to find the curved surface area of the cylinder. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First off, when you melt a solid and recast it into a different shape, the volume remains the same, right? So the volume of the sphere will be equal to the volume of the cylinder. That seems important. I'll need the formulas for both volumes.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. The radius of the sphere is 6 cm, so plugging that in, I get (4/3)π*(6)^3. Let me calculate that: 6 cubed is 216, so 4/3 of 216 is 288. So the volume of the sphere is 288π cm³.

Now, the cylinder's volume is πr²h. The problem gives the height (h) as 32 cm, but it doesn't provide the radius. Let me call the cylinder's radius 'R' to keep track. So the cylinder's volume is πR²*32, which I can write as 32πR².

Since the volumes are equal, I can set them equal to each other: 288π = 32πR². Wait, both sides have π, so I can divide both sides by π to simplify. That leaves me with 288 = 32R². Now, to solve for R², I can divide both sides by 32. So 288 divided by 32 is... let me see, 32 goes into 288 nine times because 32*9=288. So R² = 9. Taking the square root of both sides, R = 3 cm. So the radius of the cylinder is 3 cm.

Now, I need the curved surface area of the cylinder. The formula for that is 2πRh. I have R as 3 cm and h as 32 cm. Plugging those in, it's 2π*3*32. Let me compute that: 3 times 32 is 96, so 2*96 is 192. So the curved surface area is 192π square centimeters.

Wait, should I leave it in terms of π or compute a numerical value? The question asks"

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about Vernier calipers and their scales. I remember that Vernier calipers have two scales: the main scale and the Vernier scale. The main scale is like the regular ruler measurements, and the Vernier scale provides more precise measurements by having smaller increments.

The problem says that 10 divisions on the Vernier scale are equal to 9 divisions on the main scale. I think this relates to the concept of least count or the smallest measurement that can be made using the Vernier calipers. The least count is usually the difference between one main division and one Vernier division.

So, if 10 Vernier divisions equal 9 main divisions, then each Vernier division is slightly smaller than each main division. Let me set up an equation to find the value of one Vernier division.

Let's assume each main division is 1 cm because that's standard, but wait, sometimes it's in mm, so I need to clarify. Oh, in this context, since the question asks for the answer in centimeters, it's probably in cm. So, 1 main division is 1 cm or 10 mm. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused here. Usually, the main scale is in cm, and each cm is divided into 10 mm, so each main division is 1 cm.

If 10 Vernier divisions = 9 main divisions, and each main division is 1 cm, then 10 Vernier divisions equal 9 cm. So, one Vernier division would be 9 cm divided by 10, which is 0.9 cm. But that seems too big because usually, the Vernier scale offers finer measurements, like in mm increments. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps each main division is 1 mm instead of 1 cm. That makes more sense because then the Vernier scale would allow measurements in tenths of a mm. So, if each main division is 1 mm, then 9 main divisions equal 9 mm. Therefore, 10 Vernier divisions equal 9 mm. So, one Vernier division is 9 mm divided by 10, which is 0.9 mm, or 0.9 cm when converted to cm. But that's inconsistent because 0.9 cm is 9 mm, not 0.9 mm. I think I'm mixing up the units here.

I need to determine the percentage composition of sulfur (S) in sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

First, I'll find the atomic mass of each element involved:
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.008.
- Sulfur (S) has an atomic mass of about 32.065.
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00.

Next, I'll calculate the molar mass of sulfuric acid:
- There are two hydrogen atoms, so 2 * 1.008 = 2.016.
- There is one sulfur atom, so 32.065.
- There are four oxygen atoms, so 4 * 16.00 = 64.00.

Adding these together gives a molar mass of 2.016 + 32.065 + 64.00 = 98.081 g/mol.

Now, to find the percentage composition of sulfur:
I'll take the mass of sulfur in the compound, which is 32.065 g/mol, and divide it by the molar mass of sulfuric acid (98.081 g/mol).

Finally, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
(32.065 / 98.081) * 100 ≈ 32.065%.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
What is the percentage composition of sulfur in sulfuric acid?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Formula:**
   - Sulfuric acid is represented by the chemical formula **H₂SO₄**.
   - This means one molecule of sulfuric acid contains:
     - **2 hydrogen atoms (H)**
     - **1 sulfur atom (S)**
     - **4 oxygen atoms (O)**

2. **Determining Atomic Masses:**
   - **Hydrogen (H):** 1.008 g/mol (1 atom = 1.008 g)
   - **Sulfur (S):** 32.065 g/mol
   - **Oxygen (O):** 16.00 g/mol (1 atom = 16.00 g)

3. **Calculating Molar Mass of H₂SO₄:**
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of } H_2SO_4 = (2 \times 1.008) + 32.065 + (4 \times 16.00) = 2.016 + 32.065 +"

Hmm, okay, so I have this problem here: a wheel with a diameter of 0.20 meters makes one full rotation. I need to figure out how much distance it covers. Alright, let me think. 

First, I remember that when a wheel rolls without slipping, the distance it covers in one full rotation is equal to its circumference. So, that makes sense because as it makes one complete turn, each point on the wheel touches the ground once, and the total arc length that touches the ground should be the circumference.

Wait, but what exactly is the circumference? Oh, right, it's the perimeter of the circular wheel. The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is either 2 times pi times the radius (C = 2πr) or pi times the diameter (C = πd), since the diameter is twice the radius (d = 2r). 

Okay, so in this problem, the diameter is given as 0.20 meters. That's d = 0.20 m. So, I can use the formula C = πd to find the circumference. That should give me the distance covered in one rotation.

Let me plug in the numbers. The diameter is 0.20 meters, so C = π * 0.20. I know that π is approximately 3.1416, but I could also leave it in terms of π if needed. But since the question is asking for the distance in meters, probably a numerical value is expected.

Calculating that, 0.20 multiplied by π would be 0.20 * 3.1416. Let me do that multiplication. 0.2 times 3 is 0.6, 0.2 times 0.1416 is about 0.02832, so adding them together gives approximately 0.62832 meters.

Wait, does that seem right? Let me double-check. Yes, because the circumference is directly related to the diameter, so using the formula directly should be correct. Just to be sure, another way to think about it is if the diameter is 0.20m, then the radius is half of that, which is 0.10m. Using C = 2πr, that would be 2 * π * 0.10. Which is 0.20 * π, which is the same as before. So that checks out.

Therefore, when the wheel makes one full rotation, it covers a distance"

Alright, I need to solve this problem where the difference in the circumferences of two circles is 120 cm, and I have to find the difference in their radii. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. So, if there are two circles, let's say the first one has a radius r1 and the second one has a radius r2.

The problem states that the difference in their circumferences is 120 cm. So, mathematically, that's C1 - C2 = 120 cm. Substituting the formula for circumference, that becomes 2πr1 - 2πr2 = 120 cm.

I can factor out the 2π from both terms, which gives 2π(r1 - r2) = 120 cm. Now, I need to solve for (r1 - r2), which is the difference in radii. To isolate that, I should divide both sides of the equation by 2π.

So, (r1 - r2) = 120 cm / (2π). Simplifying the right side, 120 divided by 2 is 60, so it's (r1 - r2) = 60 / π cm.

Now, numerically, π is approximately 3.1416. Dividing 60 by π gives me roughly 19.098 cm. Rounding that to a reasonable decimal place, say two, it would be about 19.10 cm. But since the original problem uses whole numbers and doesn't specify decimal places, I can round it to about 19.10 cm or, more neatly, 19.1 cm.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. I started with the circumference formula, subtracted the two, factored out 2π, and then divided by 2π. That seems correct. Maybe I should consider if there's any catch or if I interpreted the problem right. The problem mentions the difference in radii, so as long as I correctly applied the formulas, this should be right.

Just to be thorough, let me plug the numbers back in. If the difference in radii is about 19.1 cm, then the difference in circumferences would be 2π*(19.1) cm. Calculating that, 2 times π is about 6.283"

First, I need to understand that when limestone (calcium carbonate) is heated in an open container, it undergoes thermal decomposition to produce calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas.

Next, I'll calculate the molar mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The molar masses are approximately: Calcium (Ca) = 40 g/mol, Carbon (C) = 12 g/mol, and Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol. So, the molar mass of CaCO3 is 40 + 12 + (16 * 3) = 100 g/mol.

Then, I'll determine the molar mass of calcium oxide (CaO), which is 40 + 16 = 56 g/mol.

Since the reaction is:
CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
100 g of CaCO3 produces 56 g of CaO.

To find out how much CaO is produced from 200 g of CaCO3, I'll set up the proportion:
(56 g CaO / 100 g CaCO3) = x / 200 g CaCO3

Solving for x gives:
x = (56/100) * 200 = 112 g

Therefore, heating 200 grams of limestone will yield 112 grams of calcium oxide.

**Translation of the Problem:**
Heating 200 grams of limestone in an open vessel, what amount of calcium oxide will be obtained?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Chemical Reaction:**

   - The carbon dioxide gas escapes into the atmosphere since the container is open.

Problem:
The diameter of a circle is 9 cm. Find the central angle corresponding to a 15 cm long arc.

Solution:
Step 1: Recall the formula for the length of an arc, which is given by:
Arc Length = (θ/360) × 2πr
where θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius.

Step 2: Determine the radius of the circle using the diameter:
Radius r = Diameter / 2 = 9 cm / 2 = 4.5 cm

Step 3: Plug the known values into the arc length formula:
15 cm = (θ/360) × 2 × π × 4.5 cm

Step 4: Simplify the equation to solve for θ:
15 = (θ/360) × 9π

Step 5: Multiply both sides by 360 to isolate θ:
15 × 360 = θ × 9π
5400 = 9πθ

Step 6: Solve for θ by dividing both sides by 9π:
θ = 5400 / (9π) = 600 / π degrees

Therefore, the central angle is 600/π degrees.
</think>

# Solution:

To find the central angle corresponding to a 15 cm long arc in a circle with a diameter of 9 cm, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the radius of the circle:**
   
   The radius \( r \) is half of the diameter.
   \[
   r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{9\ \text{cm}}{2} = 4.5\ \text{cm}
   \]

2. **Recall the formula for the length of an arc:**
   
   The length of an arc \( L \) can be calculated using the central angle \( \theta \) (in degrees) and the radius \( r \):
   \[
   L = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r
   \]

3. **Plug the known values into the formula:**
   
   Given \( L = 15 \) cm and \( r = 4.5 \) cm, substitute these values:
   \[
   15 = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi \times 4.5

Alright, so I've got this problem here in Bengali about a coin being tossed 750 times and getting heads 300 times. I need to find the relative frequency of heads. Hmm, okay, first I should translate it to make sure I understand. 

Okay, relative frequency, I think that's like how often something happens compared to the total number of trials. So in this case, the total number of tosses is 750, and heads came up 300 times. So I guess I need to calculate 300 divided by 750 to get the relative frequency. 

Wait, let me think about what relative frequency actually means. It's the number of times an event occurs divided by the total number of trials, right? That makes sense. It gives a proportion or a probability estimate. So yeah, 300 out of 750 times. 

Now, to calculate that, I can write it as a fraction: 300/750. I can simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 150. Let's see, 300 divided by 150 is 2, and 750 divided by 150 is 5. So it's 2/5. 

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 150 times 2 is 300, and 150 times 5 is 750. Yeah, that's correct. So 300/750 simplifies to 2/5. 

But maybe I should also convert it to a decimal or a percentage for better understanding. So 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, which is 40%. That means heads came up 40% of the time. 

Let me verify my steps: Count of heads is 300, total tosses 750. 300/750 simplifies to 2/5, which is 0.4 or 40%. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. It's a straightforward calculation.
</think>

To determine the relative frequency of heads when a coin is tossed 750 times and lands heads 300 times, we use the formula for relative frequency, which is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of trials.

1. Count of heads (favorable outcomes) = 300
2. Total number of tosses (trials) = 750
3. Relative frequency = 300 / 750 = 0.4

First, I understand that the problem involves a hydraulic press with two pistons of different sizes. The small piston has an area of 5 cm², and the large piston has an area of 25 cm². A force of 100 N is applied to the small piston, and I need to determine the resulting force on the large piston.

I recall that in a hydraulic system, the pressure applied to both pistons is the same because the fluid transmits the pressure equally in all directions. Pressure is calculated by dividing the applied force by the area of the piston.

So, I'll calculate the pressure on the small piston first. By applying the formula Pressure = Force / Area, I find that the pressure is 100 N divided by 5 cm², which equals 20 N/cm².

Since the pressure remains the same for the large piston, I'll use this pressure value to find the force exerted on the large piston. This time, I rearrange the formula to solve for force: Force = Pressure * Area. Multiplying the pressure (20 N/cm²) by the large piston's area (25 cm²) gives a force of 500 N.

Therefore, the force on the large piston is 500 Newtons.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Problem Translation:**
   A hydraulic press has a small piston with an area of 5 cm² and a large piston with an area of 25 cm². When a force of 100 N is applied to the small piston, what force is exerted on the large piston?

2. **Understand the Principle:**
   In a hydraulic system, pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. The relationship between force and area in pistons is given by Pascal's principle, which states that the pressure (force per unit area) is the same on both pistons.

3. **Calculate the Pressure on the Small Piston:**
   \[
   \text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{100 \, \text{N}}{5 \, \text{cm}²} = 20 \, \frac{\text{N}}{\text{cm}²}

First, understand that the car wheel completes one full rotation (circumference) of its circle in one spin.

The total distance traveled is 250 meters, and the wheel spins 35 times. Therefore, the circumference of the wheel multiplied by the number of spins equals the total distance.

So, the circumference (C) can be calculated as total distance divided by the number of spins: C = 250 / 35.

Using the formula for the circumference of a circle, C = 2πr, we can solve for the radius (r). Rearranging the formula gives r = C / (2π).

Substituting the value of C into the formula: r = (250 / 35) / (2π).

This calculation will give the radius of the car wheel.
</think>

### Translation of the Problem:
""A car wheel follows a circular path 250 meters long and spins 35 times. What is the radius of the wheel in meters?""

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Relationship Between Distance and Circumference:**
   - When a wheel completes one full spin, it covers a distance equal to its **circumference**.
   - The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
     \[
     C = 2\pi r
     \]
     where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

2. **Calculate the Circumference:**
   - The wheel spins **35 times** to cover **250 meters**.
   - Therefore, one full spin (the circumference) is:
     \[
     C = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Number of Spins}} = \frac{250}{35} \, \text{meters}
     \]
     \[
     C = 7.142857 \, \text{meters}
     \]

3. **Solve for the Radius:**
   - Using the circumference formula \( C = 2\pi r \), solve for \( r \):
     \[
     r = \frac{C}{2\pi}
     \]
     Substitute \( C = 7.142857 \, \text{m} \):
     \[
     r = \frac{7.142857}{2 \times 3.1416} = \frac{7.142857}{6.2832} \approx 1.137 \, \text{meters}

First, I need to calculate the force exerted by the woman's foot on the ground. Since her mass is 40 kg and the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s², the force is calculated as:

F = m * g = 40 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 392 N

Next, I need to determine the area over which this force is applied. The problem states that the area of the shoe sole is 200 cm². To convert this to square meters, I divide by 10,000:

A = 200 cm² / 10,000 = 0.02 m²

Finally, I can calculate the pressure using the formula P = F / A:

P = 392 N / 0.02 m² = 19,600 Pa

Therefore, the pressure exerted when the woman stands on one foot is 19,600 pascals.

First, I need to determine the atomic mass of nitrogen (N), which is approximately 14 atomic mass units (amu) per atom.

Next, since there are 6 moles of nitrogen, each mole containing Avogadro's number (approximately 6.022 × 10²³) of atoms, the calculation involves multiplying the atomic mass by the number of moles.

Therefore, the molecular weight of 6 moles of nitrogen is 14 amu multiplied by 6, resulting in 84 atomic mass units.

First, I will calculate the moles of hydrogen and chlorine gas using their molar masses. The molar mass of hydrogen is 2 g/mol, so 5 g ÷ 2 g/mol = 2.5 mol of H₂. Similarly, the molar mass of chlorine is approximately 71 g/mol, so 75 g ÷ 71 g/mol ≈ 1.056 mol of Cl₂.

Next, I'll identify the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio from the balanced equation H₂ + Cl₂ → HCl. Since the reaction requires a 1:1 molar ratio of H₂ to Cl₂, I can determine which reactant is limiting. With 2.5 mol of H₂ and 1.056 mol of Cl₂, chlorine is the limiting reactant because there isn't enough to fully react with all the hydrogen.

All of the chlorine (1.056 mol) will react, producing 1.056 mol of HCl and consuming 1.056 mol of H₂. Therefore, the amount of unreacted hydrogen is 2.5 mol - 1.056 mol = 1.444 mol.
</think>

**Solution:**

We are given:

- Mass of Hydrogen Gas (H₂) = 5 grams  
- Mass of Chlorine Gas (Cl₂) = 75 grams  

**Step 1: Calculate the Moles of Each Reactant**

First, we convert the masses of H₂ and Cl₂ into moles using their respective molar masses.

- Molar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol  
- Molar mass of Cl₂ ≈ 71 g/mol  

Moles of H₂ = \( \frac{5 \text{ g}}{2 \text{ g/mol}} = 2.5 \text{ mol} \)  

Moles of Cl₂ = \( \frac{75 \text{ g}}{71 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 1.056 \text{ mol} \)  

**Step 2: Write the Balanced Chemical Equation**

The reaction between hydrogen and chlorine is:  
\[ \text{H}_2 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HCl} \]  

From the equation, 1 mole of H₂ reacts with 1 mole of Cl₂.  

**Step 3: Determine the Limiting Reactant**

Compare the mole ratio of the reactants to the balanced equation.

Okay, so I've got this problem here: ""The gravitational acceleration at the peak of a hill is 9.77 m/s². What is the height of the hill in meters?"" Hmm. Wait, gravitational acceleration at the peak is given as 9.77 m/s², and I need to find the height of the hill. But wait, isn't gravitational acceleration typically around 9.8 m/s² on the Earth's surface? When you go up, it actually decreases slightly because you're farther from the Earth's center. But in this problem, it's given as 9.77, which is a bit less than 9.8, so maybe the hill is not too high. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is simply asking for the height of the hill given that the gravitational acceleration at the peak is 9.77 m/s². But I'm a bit confused because gravitational acceleration isn't typically something that determines height directly. Usually, height would relate to other factors like potential energy or maybe using the difference in g due to altitude, but that's more about how g changes with height. 

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the hill is on another planet or something where g is 9.77 m/s², and they just want the height in meters, but that doesn't make sense because it's just asking for height, not acceleration. Or perhaps it's a trick question where they just want the numerical value, like if g is 9.77 m/s², then the height is 9.77 meters, but that seems too straightforward and probably incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. In physics, gravitational acceleration g is calculated as g = GM/R², where M is the mass of the Earth, R is the radius. But if you're at a height h above the Earth's surface, then the acceleration becomes g' = g/(1 + h/R)². Maybe this formula could help find h if g' is less than g. But wait, in this problem, the acceleration at the peak is given as 9.77 m/s², which is actually less than 9.8 m/s². So, plugging into that formula, 9.77 = 9.8 / (1 + h/R)². Solving for h would give the height. But R, the Earth's radius, is about 6,371 km or 6,371,000"

First, I need to understand the problem fully. The car is traveling at 54 km/h, which I should convert to meters per second because the distance given is in meters. I'll use the conversion factor 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h to find the initial velocity.

Next, the car has to stop 1 meter short of the pedestrian who is 46 meters away, meaning the stopping distance is actually 45 meters from the car's initial position to the point where it stops.

With the initial velocity and stopping distance known, I can use the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \) to find the acceleration. Here, the final velocity \( v \) is 0 m/s since the car comes to a complete stop.

Plugging in the values, I'll solve for \( a \), the acceleration. This will give the rate at which the car is decelerating to stop safely before the pedestrian.

   Where:
   - \( v = 0 \, \text{m/s} \) (final velocity),
   - \( u = 15 \, \text{m/s} \) (initial velocity),
   - \( s = 45 \, \text{m} \) (distance),
   - \( a = ? \) (acceleration).

Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a square has a diagonal of length 5√2 centimeters, and I have to find its area. Let me start by recalling my geometry. I remember that in a square, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the sides of the square. 

So, if I imagine the square, and draw both its diagonals, they intersect each other at 90 degrees. Each side of the square is the same length, let's call that 's'. The diagonal, then, would be the hypotenuse of this right-angled triangle formed by two sides of the square.

Now, I remember the Pythagorean theorem, which says that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, applying that here, the length of the diagonal squared should be equal to the side squared plus the other side squared.

But wait, since both sides are equal in a square, that means the diagonal squared is equal to two times the side squared. So, the formula I can use is:

\( \text{Diagonal}^2 = 2 \times \text{Side}^2 \)

I can rearrange this formula to solve for the side. Let me write that down.

Given that the diagonal is 5√2 cm, plugging that into the equation:

\( (5\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \times s^2 \)

Now, let me compute the left side. First, square 5, which is 25, and then square √2, which is 2. So, 25 times 2 is 50.

\( 50 = 2 \times s^2 \)

To solve for s squared, I can divide both sides by 2.

\( s^2 = 50 / 2 \)

\( s^2 = 25 \)

Wait a minute, but s squared is the area of the square, isn't it? Because area of a square is side squared. So, I'm trying to find the area, and according to this calculation, it's 25 square centimeters.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the diagonal being 5√2, applying the formula diagonal squared equals 2 times side squared, squaring 5√2 gives 25 times 2 equals 50, then dividing by 2 gives s squared as"

First, I need to translate the problem into English to understand it clearly. The problem states that a spherical ball with a radius of 6 centimeters fits perfectly inside a cube-shaped box. I need to find the volume of the box in cubic centimeters.

Since the ball fits perfectly inside the cube, the diameter of the ball will be equal to the edge length of the cube. The radius of the ball is 6 cm, so the diameter is twice the radius, which is 12 cm. This means each edge of the cube is 12 cm long.

To find the volume of the cube, I use the formula for the volume of a cube, which is edge length raised to the power of three. Calculating 12 cm multiplied by itself three times gives the volume in cubic centimeters.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a spherical ball with a radius of 6 centimeters.
   - This ball fits perfectly inside a cube-shaped box.
   - We need to find the volume of the cube.

2. **Determine the Edge of the Cube:**
   - Since the ball fits perfectly inside the cube, the diameter of the ball is equal to the edge length of the cube.
   - **Diameter** of the ball = 2 × **Radius** = 2 × 6 cm = 12 cm.
   - Therefore, the edge length of the cube (a) is 12 cm.

3. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**
   - The formula for the volume of a cube is:
     \[
     V = a^3

     V = 12 \, \text{cm} \times 12 \, \text{cm} \times 12 \, \text{cm} = 1728 \, \text{cm}^3

Okay, let's see, I need to solve this chemistry problem where 64 grams of oxygen are reacted with 46 grams of sodium to produce sodium oxide. I have to find out how much oxygen is left over. 

First, I think I should start by recalling the chemical reaction between sodium and oxygen. Sodium (Na) reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form sodium oxide (Na₂O). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

4Na + O₂ → 2Na₂O

So, from the equation, 4 moles of sodium react with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 2 moles of sodium oxide.

Next, I need to calculate the number of moles of each reactant. To do that, I should remember the molar masses. 

- The molar mass of sodium (Na) is approximately 23 g/mol.
- The molar mass of oxygen (O₂) is about 32 g/mol (since each oxygen atom is 16 g/mol, and there are two atoms in a molecule).

So, the moles of sodium (n_Na) are 46 grams divided by 23 g/mol, which is 2 moles.

Similarly, the moles of oxygen (n_O2) are 64 grams divided by 32 g/mol, which equals 2 moles.

Now, looking back at the balanced equation, the mole ratio of sodium to oxygen is 4:1. That means 4 moles of Na react with 1 mole of O₂.

I have 2 moles of Na and 2 moles of O₂. Let me see which one is the limiting reactant. The required oxygen for 2 moles of Na would be (2 moles Na) * (1 mole O₂ / 4 moles Na) = 0.5 moles O₂. Since I have 2 moles of O₂, which is more than 0.5, sodium is the limiting reactant here. That means all the sodium will be used up, and some oxygen will remain.

Now, I need to find out how much oxygen reacts. Since 4 moles Na react with 1 mole O₂, 2 moles Na will react with (1/4)*2 = 0.5 moles O₂.

So, the reacted oxygen is 0.5 moles. The initial amount was 2 moles, so the remaining oxygen is 2 - 0."

First, I identify the chemical formula of Ammonia, which is NH₃. This means one molecule of Ammonia consists of one Nitrogen atom and three Hydrogen atoms.

Next, I look up the atomic masses of Nitrogen and Hydrogen from the periodic table. The atomic mass of Nitrogen is approximately 14.01 grams per mole, and each Hydrogen atom has an atomic mass of about 1.008 grams per mole.

To find the molecular weight of Ammonia, I calculate the sum of the atomic masses. So, I add the atomic mass of Nitrogen to three times the atomic mass of Hydrogen: 14.01 + 3(1.008).

Performing the calculation, 3 times 1.008 equals 3.024. Adding this to 14.01 gives a total molecular weight of 17.039 grams per mole.

First, I need to understand the problem correctly. It states that an object tied with thread is lifted vertically once. The task is to calculate the amount of work done in joules.

Assuming the object has a mass of 1 kilogram, its weight is calculated using the formula: weight = mass × gravitational acceleration. Taking gravitational acceleration as 9.81 m/s², the weight becomes 9.81 joules.

If the object is lifted vertically once, the distance lifted is approximately the length of the thread, which can be considered as 1 meter for simplicity.

Using the formula for work done, which is work = force × distance, the calculation becomes: 9.81 joules × 1 meter = 9.81 joules.

Therefore, the amount of work done in lifting the object is 9.81 joules.
</think>

**Problem:**  
An object is tied with a thread and lifted vertically once. Calculate the work done in joules.

**Solution:**  
To find the work done in lifting the object, we use the work formula:

\[
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
\]

1. **Determine the Force:**  
   The force required to lift the object is equal to its weight. Assuming the object's mass \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \), use the formula:  

   \[
   \text{Force} = m \times g
   \]  

   Where \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity).  

   \[
   \text{Force} = 1 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 9.81 \, \text{N}
   \]  

2. **Determine the Distance:**  
   The object is lifted vertically once. Assume the distance \( d \) lifted is \( 1 \, \text{meter} \).

3. **Calculate the Work Done:**  

   \[
   \text{Work} = 9.81 \, \text{N} \times 1 \, \text{m} = 9.81 \, \text{J}
   \]

Okay, so I need to find the surface area of a cube where one of its edges is 2 centimeters long. Hmm, let me think. I remember that a cube has six faces, and each face is a square. So, if I can find the area of one face and multiply it by six, that should give me the total surface area.

First, I need to calculate the area of one square face. The edge of the cube is 2 cm, so each edge of the square is 2 cm. The area of a square is calculated by side length squared. That means I take 2 cm and multiply it by itself, which is 2 times 2. So, 2 cm times 2 cm equals 4 square centimeters. That's the area of one face.

Now, since the cube has six identical faces, I need to multiply the area of one face by six. So, I take 4 square centimeters and multiply it by 6. Let me do that multiplication: 4 times 6 is 24. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is 24 square centimeters.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The edge is 2 cm, so each face has an area of 2 squared, which is 4. Multiplying that by 6 faces gives me 24. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I'm confident the surface area is 24 square meters? Wait, no, wait! The question was in centimeters, not meters. Oh no, did I make a mistake with the units?

Wait, the problem says the edge is 2 cm, so the surface area should be in square centimeters, not square meters. So actually, the correct unit should be 24 cm². Oh, I see, I almost messed that up. So, the answer is definitely 24 square centimeters, not meters. I should be careful with units next time.

Alternatively, if I wanted to convert it to square meters, I would have to adjust the conversion factor. Since 1 meter is 100 centimeters, 1 square meter is 10,000 square centimeters. So, if I took 24 cm² and converted that to m², it would be 0.0024 m², but the problem doesn't ask for that. It just asks for the surface area in square meters, but wait,"

First, I identify the initial velocity \( u \) as 15 m/s and the final velocity \( v \) as 75 m/s. The time taken \( t \) is 10 seconds.

Using the formula \( v = u + at \), I substitute the known values to solve for acceleration \( a \).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( a \), I get \( a = \frac{v - u}{t} \).

Plugging in the numbers, \( a = \frac{75 - 15}{10} \).

This simplifies to \( a = \frac{60}{10} \), so \( a = 6 \) m/s².

### Translation:
The speed of a car increases uniformly from 15 m/s to 75 m/s in 10 seconds. What is the acceleration of the car in m/s²?

---

**Solution:**

We are given:
- Initial velocity (\( u \)) = 15 m/s
- Final velocity (\( v \)) = 75 m/s
- Time (\( t \)) = 10 seconds

To find the acceleration (\( a \)), we can use the formula:

\[
v = u + a \cdot t
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{v - u}{t}
\]

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[
a = \frac{75 \text{ m/s} - 15 \text{ m/s}}{10 \text{ s}} = \frac{60 \text{ m/s}}{10 \text{ s}} = 6 \text{ m/s}^2

First, I recognize that both the number of bananas (1,000,000) and the number of people (1,000) are given in decimal (base-10), but the problem specifies that these numbers are in binary (base-2).

To solve the problem, I need to convert these binary numbers to their decimal equivalents. 

Starting with 1,000,000 in binary:
- Each digit represents a power of 2, so 1,000,000 in binary is equal to 2⁶ = 64 in decimal.

Next, converting 1,000 in binary:
- Similarly, 1,000 in binary is equal to 2³ = 8 in decimal.

Now, I divide the total number of bananas by the number of people:
- 64 bananas ÷ 8 people = 8 bananas per person.

Therefore, each person will receive 8 bananas.

  - **Number of People:**  
    In binary, \(1000_2 = 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 8_{10}\)

- **Step 2:** Divide the total number of bananas by the number of people to find out how many bananas each person gets.

Alright, so I have this problem: When a coin is tossed three times, what's the probability of getting at least one head? Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with probabilities, especially with multiple trials, it's often helpful to consider both the event we're interested in and its complement.

First, the problem is about tossing a coin three times. Each toss is an independent event, meaning the outcome of one toss doesn't affect the others. Each toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T), each with a probability of 1/2.

Now, the question is asking for the probability of getting at least one head in those three tosses. At least one head means that in three tosses, we could have one head and two tails, two heads and one tail, or all three heads. Calculating the probability for each of these scenarios and adding them up might seem the straightforward approach, but I recall there's a more efficient way by using the complement rule.

Instead of calculating the probability of getting at least one head directly, I can calculate the probability of the opposite event, which is getting no heads at all, i.e., all tails. Once I have that, I can subtract it from 1 to get the desired probability.

So, let's define:
- P(at least one head) = 1 - P(no heads)

To find P(no heads), we need the probability of getting tails on all three tosses. Since each toss is independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each individual outcome.

The probability of getting tails on a single toss is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of getting tails on three consecutive tosses is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.

Now, plug this into our initial equation:
P(at least one head) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.

Wait, let me double-check. If there are three tosses, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^3 = 8. The number of outcomes with all tails is just 1 (TTT). So, the number of outcomes with at least one head is 8 - 1 = 7. Therefore, the probability is indeed 7/8.

Yes, that makes sense. Using the complement method avoids having to calculate multiple individual probabilities and then adding them up,"

First, identify the given information: the mass of CO₂ is 88 grams and the problem is at standard temperature and pressure (STP). 

Next, determine the molar mass of carbon dioxide. The atomic mass of carbon (C) is 12 g/mol and oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol. Since there are two oxygen atoms in CO₂, the molar mass is 12 + (2 × 16) = 44 g/mol.

Then, calculate the number of moles of CO₂ by dividing the mass by the molar mass: moles = 88 g / 44 g/mol = 2 moles.

At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, multiply the number of moles by the volume per mole: volume = 2 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 44.8 liters.

Thus, the volume of 88 grams of carbon dioxide gas at STP is 44.8 liters.

First, identify the chemical formula of aluminum hydroxide, which is Al(OH)₃.

Next, calculate the molar mass of aluminum hydroxide by adding the atomic masses of its constituent elements:
- Aluminum (Al) has an atomic mass of 27 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of 16 g/mol, and there are three oxygen atoms in the compound.
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of 1 g/mol, and there are three hydrogen atoms in the compound.

So, the molar mass of Al(OH)₃ is 27 + (16 * 3) + (1 * 3) = 78 g/mol.

Then, determine the mass of aluminum in one mole of aluminum hydroxide, which is 27 g.

Finally, calculate the mass percent of aluminum in aluminum hydroxide by dividing the mass of aluminum by the molar mass of the compound and multiplying by 100:
(27 / 78) * 100 ≈ 34.62%.

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the mass percentage of aluminum in aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I think it involves some basic chemistry concepts, like molar masses and maybe some stoichiometry. 

First, I should probably figure out the molar mass of aluminum hydroxide. I remember that the molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule. So, I need the atomic masses of aluminum (Al), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H). Let me see, I think aluminum has an atomic mass of around 27 g/mol. Oxygen is about 16 g/mol, and hydrogen is approximately 1 g/mol. 

Alright, the formula for aluminum hydroxide is Al(OH)₃, which means there's one aluminum atom, three oxygen atoms, and three hydrogen atoms in each molecule. So, I can calculate the molar mass of Al(OH)₃ by adding up the molar masses of each atom.

Let me do that:

- Aluminum (Al): 27 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 3 atoms × 16 g/mol = 48 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms × 1 g/mol = 3 g/mol

Adding those together: 27 + 48 + 3 = 78 g/mol. Okay, so"

First, I need to translate the problem from Bengali to English to understand it clearly. The problem states that 5 grams of coke and 5 grams of oxygen react to produce carbon dioxide. I need to determine how many grams of coke will remain after the reaction is complete.

Next, I'll write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The combustion of coke (carbon) with oxygen produces carbon dioxide. The balanced equation is:

C + O₂ → CO₂

Now, I'll calculate the molar masses of the reactants and products. The molar mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O₂) is 32 g/mol (since each oxygen atom is 16 g/mol and there are two atoms in O₂). The molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO₂) is 44 g/mol (12 g/mol for carbon and 16 g/mol for each of the two oxygen atoms).

Using the balanced equation, 1 mole of carbon reacts with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 1 mole of carbon dioxide. The available amounts are 5 grams of coke and 5 grams of oxygen. I'll convert these masses to moles:

Moles of C = 5 g / 12 g/mol ≈ 0.417 mol
Moles of O₂ = 5 g / 32 g/mol ≈ 0.156 mol

From the balanced equation, the molar ratio of C to O₂ is 1:1. Therefore, the limiting reactant in this reaction is oxygen since it has fewer moles (0.156 mol compared to 0.417 mol of carbon). This means that all 0.156 moles of oxygen will be consumed in the reaction, and only part of the carbon will react.

The amount of carbon that reacts is equal to the amount of oxygen available, which is 0.156 mol. To find the mass of reacted carbon:

Mass of reacted C = 0.156 mol × 12 g/mol ≈ 1.872 g

Since the total mass of carbon initially is 5 grams, the remaining mass of carbon after the reaction is:

Remaining mass of C = 5 g - 1.872 g ≈ 3.128 g

Therefore, after the reaction is complete, approximately 3.13 grams of coke will remain.

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. The question is asking about the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas under standard conditions. Hmm, I remember that standard conditions usually mean 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere of pressure. 

First, I need to find out how many moles of hydrogen are in 2 grams. I know that the molar mass of hydrogen is about 1 gram per mole. So, 2 grams divided by 1 gram per mole should give me 2 moles of hydrogen. That makes sense because hydrogen is a very light gas.

Next, I recall that at standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So if I have 2 moles, I should multiply 22.4 liters by 2. Let me do that: 22.4 liters/mole * 2 moles = 44.8 liters. 

Wait, does the molar volume change with the type of gas? Oh, right, at STP, all gases behave ideally, so each mole occupies 22.4 liters regardless of the gas type. So hydrogen, even though it's lighter, still follows this rule under these conditions.

I think that's it. So 2 grams of hydrogen gas at STP should occupy 44.8 liters.

# Problem Translation:
Prove the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas under standard conditions.

# Solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the volume of 2 grams of hydrogen gas (H₂) under standard conditions (temperature = 0°C or 273.15 K, pressure = 1 atmosphere).

**Step 2: Determine Moles of Hydrogen**
The molar mass of hydrogen (H₂) is approximately 2 g/mol (since each hydrogen atom is 1 g/mol, and there are 2 atoms in a molecule).

Number of moles (n) = mass (m) / molar mass (M)
n = 2 g / 2 g/mol = 1 mol

**Step 3: Apply Molar Volume at STP**
At standard temperature and pressure, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.

Volume (V) = n × molar volume
V = 1 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 22.4 L

Okay, so I have this problem here about a circle with a radius of 2 cm, and there's a sector with a central angle of 180 degrees. I need to find the length of the arc. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula 2πr. Since the radius is 2 cm, the circumference should be 2 * π * 2, which is 4π cm. That makes sense because the circumference is the total distance around the circle.

Now, the sector has a central angle of 180 degrees. A full circle is 360 degrees, so 180 degrees is exactly half of that. That means the arc length we're looking for should be half of the total circumference. 

Let me break it down step by step. The formula for the arc length (L) when you know the central angle (θ) in degrees is L = (θ/360) * 2πr. Plugging in the numbers, θ is 180 degrees, radius r is 2 cm. So L = (180/360) * 2 * π * 2.

Simplifying that, 180 divided by 360 is 0.5. Then 0.5 multiplied by 2πr, which is 0.5 * 4π. So 0.5 * 4π equals 2π cm. That should be the length of the arc.

Wait, let me double-check. If the central angle is 180 degrees, it's a semicircle, right? So the arc should indeed be half the circumference, which is 2π cm. That makes sense because π is approximately 3.1416, so 2π is about 6.2832 cm. But in the problem, they just ask for it in terms of π, so I don't need to calculate the numerical value unless they specify to approximate. It looks like they just want the exact value in terms of π, so 2π cm is the answer.

I think that's it. The arc length is half the circumference because the angle is half of a full circle.

To find the length of the arc (chord) in a circle with a radius of 2 cm and a central angle of 180 degrees, follow these steps:

Okay, so I have this problem here about temperature scales. The question is asking, if the difference in temperature is 1 degree Celsius, what would that difference be in Kelvin? Hmm, I've heard that Celsius and Kelvin are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, which means it starts at absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature. On the Celsius scale, water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C. In Kelvin, these points are 273.15 K and 373.15 K, respectively. So, the size of one degree in Celsius is the same as one Kelvin because the intervals between these points are the same.

Wait, that makes sense because when you convert from Celsius to Kelvin, you just add 273.15. So, if I take a temperature in Celsius and add 273.15, I get Kelvin. But that's for specific temperatures, not differences. The question is about the difference, not a specific point.

So, let's say the temperature increases by 1°C. That would mean you add 1 Kelvin as well because each degree change is the same in both scales. For example, if something is at 20°C and it increases to 21°C, that's a 1 Kelvin increase to 294.15 K from 293.15 K. The difference remains 1.

I guess that's why in scientific contexts where temperature differences are discussed, like in physics or chemistry, they often use Kelvin because it's more intuitive. Since it's an absolute scale, it doesn't have negative values like Celsius can sometimes have, which might make calculations easier.

Let me double-check this understanding. Suppose I have two temperatures, T1 and T2, in Celsius where T2 = T1 + 1°C. Converting both to Kelvin would give K1 = T1 + 273.15 and K2 = T2 + 273.15. The difference K2 - K1 would be (T2 + 273.15) - (T1 + 273.15) = T2 - T1 = 1 K. So yes, the difference is indeed 1 Kelvin.

I think I've got it. The key here is that while the Kelvin scale is offset from Celsius, the scale intervals are identical, so a change of 1 degree in Celsius translates directly to a 1 Kelvin change.

Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage of hydrogen in water. Hmm, I remember that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen, right? The chemical formula for water is H₂O, which means each molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

First, I should find out the atomic weights of hydrogen and oxygen. I think hydrogen is about 1 and oxygen is around 16, but wait, maybe I should double-check that. Yeah, on the periodic table, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, so its atomic weight is approximately 1.00794, and oxygen has an atomic number of 8, so its atomic weight is about 15.999. For simplicity, I can use 1 for hydrogen and 16 for oxygen to make the calculations easier.

So, each hydrogen atom contributes 1 atomic mass unit (amu), and there are two of them in a water molecule. That means the total mass from hydrogen is 2 * 1 = 2 amu. The oxygen contributes 16 amu. So, the total molar mass of water is 2 (from hydrogen) + 16 (from oxygen) = 18 amu.

Now, to find the percentage of hydrogen in water, I take the mass contributed by hydrogen and divide it by the total mass of the water molecule, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. That would be (2 / 18) * 100. Simplifying that, 2 divided by 18 is 1/9, which is approximately 0.1111. Multiplying by 100 gives about 11.11%.

Wait a second, maybe I should consider the exact atomic weights instead of approximating. Let me recalculate with the more precise values. Hydrogen is approximately 1.00794 and oxygen is about 15.999. So, the mass from hydrogen is 2 * 1.00794 = 2.01588 amu. The oxygen is 15.999 amu. The total molar mass is 2.01588 + 15.999 = 18.01488 amu.

Now, the percentage of hydrogen is (2.01588 / 18.01488) * 100. Calculating that gives roughly 0.1116, which is 11.16%. Hmm, so using exact values gives a slightly more precise result, but it's still around 11.11% when rounded to two decimal places.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 1000 milliliters of a potassium carbonate solution, and the concentration is 0.125 moles per liter. We need to find out how many grams of potassium carbonate are in that solution.

First, I remember that molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution. Since the volume given is 1000 milliliters, I should convert that to liters. I know that 1000 mL is equal to 1 liter, so that part is straightforward.

Next, I need to calculate the number of moles of potassium carbonate in the solution. Since molarity is moles per liter, I can just take the given molarity (0.125 moles/L) and multiply it by the volume in liters (which is 1 L). So, 0.125 moles/L * 1 L = 0.125 moles of K₂CO₃.

Now, to find the mass in grams, I need the molar mass of potassium carbonate. I recall the atomic weights from the periodic table: potassium (K) is about 39.1 g/mol, carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol. Since K₂CO₃ has two potassium atoms, one carbon, and three oxygen atoms, the calculation would be:

Molar mass of K₂CO₃ = (2 * 39.1) + 12.01 + (3 * 16.00)
Let me compute that: 2*39.1 is 78.2, plus 12.01 gives 90.21, and then 3*16 is 48. Adding those together, 90.21 + 48 equals 138.21 g/mol.

Finally, to find the mass in grams, I multiply the number of moles by the molar mass:
0.125 moles * 138.21 g/mol = 17.27625 grams. Rounding that to three decimal places, it should be approximately 17.276 g.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 2*39.1 is indeed 78.2, plus 12.01 is 90.21, and 3*16 is 48. Adding them up gives 138.21 g/mol. Then 0.125*138.21 is 17."

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The problem is about making a 200 ml 0.5 molar solution of sulfuric acid and then adding 10 grams of sodium hydroxide to it. I need to find out how much sodium hydroxide remains in the solution after this reaction. Hmm, I think I should start by understanding the chemical reaction involved here.

First, I recall that sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a diprotic acid, which means it can donate two protons (H+ ions) per molecule. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base, so when they react together, it's a neutralization reaction. The general reaction would be something like:

H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O

So, each molecule of sulfuric acid reacts with two molecules of sodium hydroxide to produce sodium sulfate and water. That makes sense because the sulfuric acid has two H+ ions to neutralize.

Now, I need to calculate the moles of each reactant to determine how much of each is consumed and what's left over. Let's start with the sulfuric acid. The problem says it's a 0.5 molar solution in 200 ml. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.5 mol/L. Since the volume is 0.2 liters (because 200 ml is 0.2 L), the moles of H2SO4 would be 0.5 mol/L * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles.

Next, the sodium hydroxide: we're adding 10 grams of NaOH. To find the moles, I need the molar mass of NaOH. Sodium (Na) is about 23 g/mol, Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol, so 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol. So, 10 grams is 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 moles of NaOH.

Now, back to the reaction. Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. So, with 0.1 moles of H2SO4, the required NaOH is 0.1 * 2"

First, I need to calculate the molar masses of carbon (C) and oxygen (O). Carbon has an atomic mass of approximately 12 g/mol, and oxygen has an atomic mass of 16 g/mol. 

Next, I'll determine the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since one molecule of CO₂ contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, the molar mass of CO₂ is 12 g/mol + 2 × 16 g/mol, which equals 44 g/mol.

Then, I'll calculate how many moles of oxygen are in 3 grams. To do this, I'll divide the given mass of oxygen by its molar mass: 3 g ÷ 16 g/mol = 0.1875 mol of O.

In one molecule of CO₂, there are two oxygen atoms, so the moles of CO₂ corresponding to the available oxygen can be found by dividing the moles of oxygen by 2: 0.1875 mol O ÷ 2 = 0.09375 mol of CO₂.

Finally, to find the mass of CO₂, I'll multiply the moles of CO₂ by its molar mass: 0.09375 mol × 44 g/mol = 4.125 grams.

Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding exactly what the problem is asking. 

The problem is about determining the circular scale reading that matches the linear scale reading during the measurement of a wire's cross-sectional area. From what I gather, there's a micrometer screw gauge involved here. Okay, I'm a bit rusty on micrometers, so let me refresh my memory.

First, the problem states the linear scale reading is 2 mm. That's the main scale, right? So the screw gauge has a main scale, and then a circular scale with a certain number of divisions. It also mentions that the circular scale has 100 divisions, and the pitch of the screw is 1 mm. When the screw makes one full rotation, the screw moves forward by the pitch, which is 1 mm in this case.

So, the total number of divisions on the circular scale is 100, which means each division represents 1/100th of a millimeter since the pitch is 1 mm. Let me calculate that: each division equals 0.01 mm, which is the same as 1 micrometer (since 1 mm = 1000 micrometers, so 0.01 mm = 10 micrometers? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 mm is 0.001 meters. Wait, no, 1 mm is 1e-3 meters, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So, yes, 0.01 mm is 10 micrometers. Hmm.)

Wait, no. Hold on. If the screw has a pitch of 1 mm, that means one full rotation advances the screw by 1 mm. The circular scale has 100 divisions, meaning each small division is 1/100 of a rotation. Since one rotation is 1 mm, each division represents 1 mm / 100 rotations. Wait, no, sorry, each division on the circular scale corresponds to how much linear movement? So, for each full rotation, the screw moves 1 mm. So, each division on the circular scale is 1 mm / 100, which is 0.01 mm, which is 10 micrometers. So each division is 10 micrometers.

Now, the reading on the circular scale is given as 0.40 mm. Wait, that can't be right. Because the circular scale"

First, I identify the mass and velocity of the two objects. The first object has a mass of 15 kg and a velocity of 3 m/s, while the second object has a mass of 10 kg and a velocity of 5 m/s.

Since the objects are moving in opposite directions, the velocity of the second object will be negative relative to the first object. Therefore, the velocity of the second object is -5 m/s.

Next, I calculate the kinetic energy of the second object using the formula for kinetic energy, which is (1/2) * mass * velocity squared. Plugging in the values, I get (1/2) * 10 kg * (-5 m/s)^2.

Performing the calculations, (-5 m/s) squared is 25, and multiplying by 10 kg gives 250. Then, multiplying by 1/2 results in 125 joules.

Thus, the kinetic energy of the second object before the collision is 125 joules.

**Translation of the Problem:**
Two objects of masses 15 kg and 10 kg are moving towards each other on the same road with velocities of 3 m/s and 5 m/s respectively. They collide head-on and stick together. What is the kinetic energy of the second object before the collision in joules?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Mass of the first object (\( m_1 \)) = 15 kg
   - Velocity of the first object (\( v_1 \)) = 3 m/s
   - Mass of the second object (\( m_2 \)) = 10 kg
   - Velocity of the second object (\( v_2 \)) = 5 m/s

   Since the objects are moving towards each other, the velocity of the second object (\( v_2 \)) will be considered negative in the same reference frame as the first object. Therefore, \( v_2 = -5 \) m/s.

2. **Calculate the kinetic energy of the second object:**
   
   The kinetic energy (\( KE \)) of an object is given by the formula:

To determine the density of the sodium hydroxide solution, I start by identifying the mass and volume of the solution. The problem states that there is 80 grams of NaOH in 2 liters of solution.

First, I recall that density is calculated by dividing the mass of the solution by its volume. However, I need to ensure that the units are consistent. Since the volume is given in liters, I should convert it to liters to match the units typically used for density in grams per milliliter or kilograms per liter.

With the consistent units, I now calculate the density by dividing the mass (80 grams) by the volume (2 liters). This gives me a density of 40 grams per liter.

Therefore, the density of the sodium hydroxide solution is 40 g/L.

Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand what it's asking. It's about an object moving along a straight path, going 10 meters forward and then coming back 4 meters. The question is about the difference between distance and displacement. Hmm, okay, I remember those terms from earlier.

Distance is the total path taken, right? So if the object goes 10 meters forward and then 4 meters back, the total distance it has traveled would be 10 + 4, which is 14 meters. That makes sense because it's the sum of all the segments it moved through.

But displacement is a bit different. Displacement is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the ending point. So if the object started at a point, moved 10 meters ahead, and then came back 4 meters, where is it now? It's 6 meters ahead from where it started. Because 10 minus 4 is 6.

Now, the question is asking for the difference between distance and displacement. So I have distance as 14 meters and displacement as 6 meters. To find the difference, I subtract the smaller one from the larger one. That would be 14 minus 6, which equals 8 meters.

Wait, let me double-check that. Did I calculate distance correctly? Yes, 10 meters forward plus 4 meters backward adds up to 14 meters total. And displacement is indeed the net change, which is 6 meters forward. So the difference between them is 8 meters. That seems right.

I don't think I made a mistake here. The key was remembering that distance is total path, while displacement is straight-line from start to finish. Once I figured that out, the rest was just plugging the numbers into the right formulas.

First, I identify the chemical reaction involved in the production of hydrochloric acid. The reaction between hydrogen (H₂) and chlorine (Cl₂) can be represented as:

H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl

From the balanced chemical equation, one mole of hydrogen reacts with one mole of chlorine to produce two moles of hydrochloric acid. This indicates a 1:1 molar ratio between hydrogen and chlorine.

Next, I calculate the moles of hydrogen and chlorine using their molar masses. The molar mass of hydrogen (H₂) is approximately 2 g/mol, and the molar mass of chlorine (Cl₂) is approximately 71 g/mol.

For hydrogen:
moles of H₂ = mass of H₂ / molar mass of H₂ = 1 g / 2 g/mol = 0.5 mol

For chlorine:
moles of Cl₂ = mass of Cl₂ / molar mass of Cl₂ = 70 g / 71 g/mol ≈ 0.9859 mol

With the 1:1 molar ratio, 0.5 moles of H₂ will require 0.5 moles of Cl₂ to completely react.

Calculating the mass of chlorine required for the reaction:
mass of Cl₂ = moles of Cl₂ * molar mass of Cl₂ = 0.5 mol * 71 g/mol = 35.5 g

Subtracting the mass of chlorine used from the initial mass provided:
mass of excess Cl₂ = initial Cl₂ mass - reacted Cl₂ mass = 70 g - 35.5 g = 34.5 g

Therefore, after the reaction, 34.5 grams of chlorine will remain unreacted.

Then, I express the ratio of the circumference to the radius by dividing the circumference by the radius, which is 10π cm / 5 cm. This simplifies to 2π.

Therefore, the ratio of the circumference to the radius is 2π.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Given the radius of a circle, \( r = 5 \) cm.
   - We need to find the ratio of the circumference (\( C \)) to the radius (\( r \)).

2. **Recall the Formula for Circumference:**
   - The formula for the circumference of a circle is:
     \[
     C = 2\pi r
     \]

   - Substitute \( r = 5 \) cm into the formula:
     \[
     C = 2\pi \times 5 = 10\pi \text{ cm}
     \]
   
4. **Determine the Ratio \( C : r \):**
   - The ratio of the circumference to the radius is:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{C}{r} = \frac{10\pi}{5} = 2\pi
     \]
   
5. **Final Answer:**

First, I identify that the problem involves a right-angled triangle, where the base is 12 units and the height is 5 units. Since it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse.

The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). So, I'll calculate:

c² = 12² + 5²
c² = 144 + 25
c² = 169

To find the value of c, I take the square root of both sides:

c = √169
c = 13

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 units.
</think>

**Solution:**

We are given a right-angled triangle with the following dimensions:
- Base (one leg) = 12 units
- Height (the other leg) = 5 units

We need to find the length of the hypotenuse.

**Step 1:** Recall the Pythagorean theorem for a right-angled triangle, which states:
\[ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]
where:
- \( c \) is the hypotenuse
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the other two sides (legs) of the triangle

**Step 2:** Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[ c = \sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} \]

**Step 3:** Calculate the squares:
\[ 12^2 = 144 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

**Step 4:** Add the results:
\[ 144 + 25 = 169 \]

**Step 5:** Take the square root of the sum to find the hypotenuse:
\[ c = \sqrt{169} \]
\[ c = 13 \]

**Final Answer:**
The length of the hypotenuse is **13 units**.

First, I understand that the problem is about determining the number of divisions on a circular scale of a screw gauge. The given screw pitch is 0.50 mm, and the least count of the screw gauge is 0.01 mm. The wire diameter measured is 7.28 mm.

To find the number of divisions on the circular scale, I need to relate the screw pitch to the least count. The least count of the screw gauge is the product of the pitch and the number of divisions on the circular scale. 

So, I'll set up the equation: least count = pitch × number of divisions.

Plugging in the given values: 0.01 mm = 0.50 mm × number of divisions.

To solve for the number of divisions, I'll divide both sides of the equation by the pitch: number of divisions = 0.01 mm / 0.50 mm.

Calculating this gives me 0.02. However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because the number of divisions should be a whole number.

Realizing there might be a mistake, I decide to cross-check the formula. I recall that the least count is calculated as the pitch divided by the number of divisions. 

So, the correct equation should be: least count = pitch / number of divisions.

Using this formula: 0.01 mm = 0.50 mm / number of divisions.

Solving for the number of divisions: number of divisions = 0.50 mm / 0.01 mm = 50.

This makes sense because having 50 divisions on the circular scale would allow the screw gauge to measure with a least count of 0.01 mm, given the pitch of 0.50 mm.

Therefore, the number of divisions on the circular scale is 50.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
The pitch of a screw gauge is 0.50 mm, and the least count is 0.01 mm. The diameter of a wire measured using this screw gauge is found to be 7.28 mm. How many divisions are there on the circular scale?

First, I need to calculate the radius of the spherical object using its volume. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³. Given that the volume is 200 cubic meters, I'll set up the equation 200 = (4/3)πr³ and solve for r.

Next, I'll determine the height of the spherical object that is submerged in water. Since the sphere is floating exactly half-submerged, the submerged volume is half of the total volume, which is 100 cubic meters. Using the formula for the volume of a spherical cap, V_cap = (πh²(3r - h))/3, I'll set 100 = (πh²(3r - h))/3 and solve for h using the radius found in the previous step.

After finding the height h, I'll calculate the buoyant force, which is equal to the weight of the displaced water. The buoyant force F is given by F = ρ_water * g * V_submerged, where ρ_water is 1000 kg/m³, g is 9.8 m/s², and V_submerged is 100 m³. Plugging in the values, I'll compute F = 1000 * 9.8 * 100 = 980,000 N.

This buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced water, which is the required answer.

Alright, I need to figure out the potential energy of the object at its maximum height. Let me start by understanding the problem. We have an object with a mass of 1 kg that's been thrown straight up and it takes 10 seconds to come back down to the ground. So, it goes up, reaches a peak height, and then falls back, taking a total of 10 seconds for the entire motion.

First, I remember that when an object is thrown straight up, its time to reach the maximum height is half the total flight time if we neglect air resistance. Since the total time here is 10 seconds, the time taken to reach the peak should be half of that, which is 5 seconds. That makes sense because after reaching the top, it takes the same amount of time to fall back down as it did to go up.

Next, I need to find the initial velocity with which the object was thrown. I recall that the velocity at the top of the trajectory is zero. Using the equation of motion under constant acceleration (which is gravity here), I can use the formula: final velocity (v) equals initial velocity (u) plus acceleration (a) times time (t). At the peak, the final velocity is 0. So, 0 = u + (-g) * t. Here, g is the acceleration due to gravity, which I'll take as 9.8 m/s².

Substituting the known values: 0 = u - 9.8 m/s² * 5 s. Solving for u gives u = 49 m/s. So, the object was thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 49 m/s.

Now, to find the maximum height, I'll use another equation of motion: the change in displacement (s) equals initial velocity (u) times time (t) plus half acceleration (a) times time squared. Plugging the numbers in: s = 49 m/s * 5 s + 0.5 * (-9.8 m/s²) * (5 s)². That simplifies to 245 m minus 122.5 m, which equals 122.5 meters. So, the maximum height reached is 122.5 meters.

With the maximum height determined, I can now calculate the potential energy at that height. Potential energy (PE) is given by mass (m) times gravity (g) times height (h). So, PE = 1 kg * 9."

First, identify the given values from the problem.

The object's mass is 2 kg, and it is lifted to a height of 5 meters.

Calculate the potential energy gained by the object using the formula:

Potential Energy (PE) = mass (m) × gravitational acceleration (g) × height (h) = 2 kg × 9.81 m/s² × 5 m = 98.1 J.

Compare the potential energy gained to the total energy expended by the motor, which is 107 J.

Determine the energy loss by subtracting the potential energy from the total energy used:

Energy Loss = Total Energy - Potential Energy = 107 J - 98.1 J = 8.9 J.

Therefore, the motor loses 8.9 joules of energy.
</think>

**Problem Translation:**  
A motor lifts an object of 2 kg mass to a height of 5 meters by consuming a total of 107 joules of energy. How much energy is wasted by the motor?

---

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**  
   - **Mass of the object (m):** 2 kg  
   - **Height lifted (h):** 5 m  
   - **Total energy consumed (E_total):** 107 J  
   - **Gravitational acceleration (g):** 9.81 m/s²  

   The potential energy (PE) gained by the object being lifted is given by:  
   \[
   PE = m \times g \times h
   \]

2. **Calculate the Potential Energy:**  
   Substitute the known values into the formula:  
   \[
   PE = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 5 \, \text{m} = 98.1 \, \text{J}
   \]  

3. **Determine the Energy Loss:**  
   The total energy consumed by the motor is 107 J, out of which 98.1 J is used to increase the potential energy. Therefore, the remaining energy is considered as waste.  
   \[
   \text{Energy Loss} = E_{\text{total}} - PE = 107 \, \text{J} - 98.1 \, \text{J} = 8.9 \, \text{J}

First, I note that the coin was flipped 2000 times, resulting in 1030 heads. To determine the probability of getting tails in a single flip, I would divide the number of tails by the total number of flips. However, the number of tails isn't directly provided.

Since each flip can only result in either heads or tails, the number of tails is the total flips minus the number of heads: 2000 - 1030 = 970 tails.

Next, I calculate the probability of getting tails by dividing the number of tails by the total number of flips: 970 / 2000. Simplifying this fraction gives 0.485, or 48.5%.

Therefore, the probability of getting tails in a single flip of this coin is 0.485.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Total Number of Flips:**  
   The coin was flipped a total of **2000** times.

2. **Number of Heads Obtained:**  
   Out of 2000 flips, **1030** times the result was **Heads**.

3. **Calculating the Probability of Getting Heads (H):**  
   The probability of getting Heads in a single flip is calculated by dividing the number of times Heads occurred by the total number of flips.  
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Heads}}{\text{Total Number of Flips}} = \frac{1030}{2000} = 0.515
   \]

4. **Understanding the Relationship Between Heads and Tails:**  
   Since each flip can only result in either Heads (H) or Tails (T), the sum of their probabilities must equal 1.  
   \[
   P(H) + P(T) = 1
   \]

5. **Calculating the Probability of Getting Tails (T):**  
   Using the relationship from Step 4, we can find the probability of getting Tails.  
   \[
   P(T) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.515 = 0.485
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**  
   The probability of getting Tails in a single flip of the coin is **0.485** or **48.5\%**.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter. The formula for the circumference (C) in terms of the diameter (d) is C = π * d, where π is approximately 3.14.

Given that the difference in the circumferences of the two wheels is 70 centimeters, I can set up the equation ΔC = C1 - C2 = 70 cm.

Substituting the circumference formula into the equation, I get π*(d1 - d2) = 70 cm.

To find the difference in diameters (Δd = d1 - d2), I can rearrange the equation to solve for Δd, which gives Δd = 70 cm / π.

Using the approximate value of π (3.14), I can calculate the difference in diameters: Δd ≈ 70 / 3.14 ≈ 22.29 centimeters.

Finally, rounding the result to a reasonable decimal place gives the difference in diameters as approximately 22.29 centimeters.

First, I need to determine the balanced chemical equation for the formation of calcium oxide. Calcium has a +2 oxidation state, and oxygen has a -2 oxidation state, so the formula for calcium oxide is CaO.

Next, I'll write the balanced reaction for the decomposition of calcium oxide into calcium and oxygen. The unbalanced reaction is CaO → Ca + O. To balance it, I split the equation into oxidation and reduction half-reactions.

Oxidation half-reaction: O²⁻ → O₂
Reduction half-reaction: Ca²+ → Ca

I balance the oxygen atoms by multiplying the oxidation half-reaction by 2:
2 O²⁻ → O₂

Then, I balance the charges by adding electrons:
2 O²⁻ → O₂ + 4e⁻

Finally, I combine the two half-reactions and simplify to get the balanced equation:
2 CaO → 2 Ca + O₂

From the balanced equation, I see that 2 moles of calcium oxide produce 1 mole of oxygen gas. Using molar masses, 2 moles of CaO weigh 84 g, and 1 mole of O₂ weighs 32 g. To find out how much oxygen is needed to produce 56 g of CaO, I set up a proportion.

Calculating the moles of CaO in 56 g, I find that 56 g is 2/3 of a mole. According to the stoichiometric ratio, the same fraction applies to the oxygen, resulting in 32/3 g of oxygen needed.

Therefore, 56 grams of calcium oxide require approximately 10.67 grams of oxygen.

Let's carefully analyze and solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
A freely falling object travels 25 meters in 5 seconds. We need to find out how much additional distance the object will cover in the 6th second.

**Step 2: Recall the Formula**
The distance traveled under constant acceleration due to gravity (assuming no air resistance) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]
Where:
- \( S \) is the distance traveled,
- \( u \) is the initial velocity (0 for free fall),
- \( a \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

**Step 3: Calculate Distance Traveled in 5 Seconds**
Plugging in the values:
\[ 25 = 0 \times 5 + \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 25 = 0 + 4.9 \times 25 \]
\[ 25 = 122.5 \, \text{m} \]
Wait, this doesn't make sense. There's a contradiction here.

**Step 4: Analyze the Discrepancy**
The calculated distance for 5 seconds is 122.5 meters, but the problem states it's only 25 meters. This implies that the object isn't in free fall or that the given information is inconsistent.

**Step 5: Re-express the Formula**
Assuming the object is in free fall and ignoring the discrepancy:
\[ S_5 = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]
\[ S_6 = \frac{1}{2} g (6)^2 \]
The additional distance covered in the 6th second is:
\[ S_6 - S_5 = \frac{1}{2} g (36) - \frac{1}{2} g (25) \]
\[ S_6 - S_5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 11 \]
\[ S_6 - S_5 = 5.4 \times 11 \]

To determine the number of moles of oxygen required to produce 56 grams of calcium oxide, we'll follow these steps:

1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the formation of calcium oxide:
   2 Ca (s) + O₂ (g) → 2 CaO (s)

   From the balanced equation, 1 mole of O₂ reacts with 2 moles of Ca to produce 2 moles of CaO.

2. Determine the molar mass of CaO:
   - Calcium (Ca) has a molar mass of 40.078 g/mol
   - Oxygen (O) has a molar mass of 16.00 g/mol
   - Molar mass of CaO = 40.078 + 16.00 = 56.078 g/mol

   However, since the given mass of CaO is 56 grams, and the molar mass is approximately 56.078 g/mol, this implies that the number of moles of CaO produced is approximately 1 mole.

3. Use the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation to find the moles of O₂ needed:
   According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of O₂ produces 2 moles of CaO. Since we have 1 mole of CaO, the moles of O₂ required are:
   Moles of O₂ = (1 mole CaO) / (2 moles CaO per 1 mole O₂) = 0.5 moles

First, I identify that the problem involves finding the central angle corresponding to an arc length in a circle.

I know the formula relating arc length, radius, and central angle in radians is \( L = r \theta \), where \( L \) is the arc length, \( r \) is the radius, and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

Given the diameter is 5 cm, the radius \( r \) is half of that, which is 2.5 cm.

The arc length \( L \) provided is 13 cm.

Plugging the known values into the formula, I get \( 13 = 2.5 \times \theta \).

To solve for \( \theta \), I divide both sides by 2.5, resulting in \( \theta = 13 / 2.5 \).

First off, I know that distance, speed, and time are related by the formula: distance = speed × time. That part is straightforward. But I need to make sure all the units are consistent, so I should convert the time from minutes to seconds because the speed is given in meters per second.

Okay, so 10 minutes. I remember that 1 minute is 60 seconds. So, if I multiply 10 by 60, that should give me the time in seconds. Let me do that calculation: 10 × 60 = 600 seconds. Got it.

Now, with the speed being 20 meters per second and the time now converted to 600 seconds, I can use the distance formula. Multiplying the speed by the time gives me the distance. So, 20 × 600. Let me compute that. 20 times 600 is 12,000.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's double-check the unit conversions. 10 minutes to seconds is definitely 600 seconds. Speed is 20 m/s, so 20 times 600 is indeed 12,000 meters. That seems right.

Hmm, 12,000 meters is quite a distance, but considering 20 m/s is a pretty fast speed, it makes sense. To put it into perspective, 20 m/s is equivalent to about 72 kilometers per hour, which is really quick, especially for a 10-minute run. 

So, just summarizing: speed is 20 m/s, time is 10 minutes which is 600 seconds, so distance is 20 × 600 = 12,000 meters. Yep, that checks out.

I think I've covered all the steps. The key was converting the time into the same unit as the speed to make the multiplication straightforward. No need to worry about more complicated formulas here because it's a simple application of the basic distance formula.

First, I identify the data provided in the problem. The main scale reading is 14 mm, and the vernier constant is 0.1 mm. The vernier scale reading is 3.

Next, I calculate the measurement using the formula:
Measurement = Main Scale Reading + (Vernier Scale Reading × Vernier Constant)

Substituting the values:
Measurement = 14 mm + (3 × 0.1 mm) = 14.3 mm

Therefore, the total reading is 14.3 mm.
</think>

# Solution:

**Step 1: Translate the Problem to English**
The main scale reading is 14 mm. The vernier constant is 0.1 mm. The vernier scale reading is 3. Find the total reading in mm.

**Step 2: Understanding the Components**
- **Main Scale Reading:** This is the measurement obtained from the main scale, which is 14 mm.
- **Vernier Constant (Least Count):** It represents the smallest measurement that can be made using the vernier calipers. Here, it is 0.1 mm.
- **Vernier Scale Reading:** This is the value obtained from the vernier scale, which is 3.

**Step 3: Calculating the Total Measurement**
The total measurement using a vernier caliper is calculated by adding the main scale reading to the product of the vernier scale reading and the vernier constant.

\[
\text{Total Reading} = \text{Main Scale Reading} + (\text{Vernier Scale Reading} \times \text{Vernier Constant})
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Total Reading} = 14\,\text{mm} + (3 \times 0.1\,\text{mm}) = 14\,\text{mm} + 0.3\,\text{mm} = 14.3\,\text{mm}

First, I need to determine the maximum height the object reaches when projected straight upward with an initial velocity of 9.8 m/s.

I recall the kinematic equation for vertical motion under constant acceleration due to gravity, which is:

v² = u² + 2as

At the highest point, the final velocity (v) becomes zero. The acceleration (a) is -g, which is -9.8 m/s², since it acts downward.

Substituting the known values into the equation:

0 = (9.8)² + 2*(-9.8)*s

Simplifying:

0 = 96.04 - 19.6s

Solving for s:

19.6s = 96.04
s = 96.04 / 19.6
s ≈ 4.9 meters

Therefore, the object reaches a maximum height of approximately 4.9 meters.
</think>

# Solution:

**Step 1: Translate the Problem**

The problem is:  
""A object is thrown straight upwards with a velocity of 9.8 m/s. How high will it go?""

**Step 2: Identify the Known and Unknown Quantities**

- Initial velocity (u) = 9.8 m/s
- Final velocity at maximum height (v) = 0 m/s
- Acceleration (a) = -g = -9.8 m/s² (negative because it acts downward)
- Maximum height (s) = ?

**Step 3: Use the Kinematic Equation**

The suitable kinematic equation to find the maximum height is:

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]

**Step 4: Substitute the Known Values into the Equation**

\[
0 = (9.8)^2 + 2(-9.8)s
\]

Simplify:

\[
0 = 96.04 - 19.6s
\]

**Step 5: Solve for s**

\[
19.6s = 96.04
\]
\[
s = \frac{96.04}{19.6} = 4.9 \text{ meters}
\]

**Conclusion:**

The object will reach a maximum height of **4.9 meters**.

First, I recognize that this is a physics problem involving an object being dropped from a certain height, and we need to determine the velocity upon impact with the ground.

Since the object is being dropped and not thrown, the initial velocity (u) at the point of release is 0 m/s. The height (s) from which the object is dropped is 50 meters. The acceleration due to gravity (a) is 9.8 m/s², which is acting on the object as it falls.

To find the final velocity (v) upon impact, I'll use the kinematic equation that relates these variables: v² = u² + 2as. Plugging in the known values, the equation becomes v² = 0 + 2 * 9.8 * 50.

Calculating 2 times 9.8 gives 19.6, and multiplying by 50 results in 980. Taking the square root of 980 yields the final velocity.

Therefore, the velocity of the object when it hits the ground is √980 m/s, which simplifies to approximately 31.30 m/s.
</think>

**Problem Translation:**  
""When an object is dropped from the roof of a 50-meter-high building, at what velocity will it hit the ground?""

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Height (s):** 50 meters (m)
   - **Initial Velocity (u):** 0 m/s (since the object is dropped, not thrown)
   - **Acceleration (a):** Acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s²
   - **Final Velocity (v):** To be determined

2. **Applying the Kinematic Equation:**
   - The formula to find the final velocity when an object is dropped is:
     \[
     v^2 = u^2 + 2as
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     v^2 = 0 + 2 \times 9.8 \times 50
     \]
     \[
     v^2 = 980
     \]
   - Taking the square root of both sides to solve for \( v \):

     v = \sqrt{980} \approx 31.30 \, \text{m/s}

First, I recognize that the problem involves converting measurements between Vernier and meter scales. The Vernier scale allows for more precise measurements by dividing the meter scale into smaller increments.

The given information states that 10 divisions on the Vernier scale equal 9 millimeters. To find the smallest measurable length, I need to determine the value of one Vernier scale division.

By dividing 9 mm by 10, I calculate that one division on the Vernier scale is 0.9 mm. This means that the Vernier scale can measure lengths down to 0.9 mm accurately.

Therefore, the smallest measurable length using the Vernier scale in conjunction with the meter scale is 0.9 mm.

**Translated Problem:**  
A Vernier scale is used with a meter scale where 10 divisions equal 9 mm. Using this, what is the smallest length that can be measured in mm?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Vernier Scale Principle**  
   The Vernier scale is a precision measuring instrument that allows for measurements smaller than the smallest division on the main scale. The smallest measurement possible is called the **least count** or **smallest division** of the Vernier scale.

2. **Calculate the Smallest Division**  
   Given that 10 Vernier scale divisions = 9 mm, we can find the value of one Vernier division.

   \[
   \text{Value of 1 Vernier Division} = \frac{\text{Main Scale Measurement}}{\text{Number of Vernier Divisions}} = \frac{9 \text{ mm}}{10} = 0.9 \text{ mm}

Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it clearly and figure it out step by step. Let's see, the problem is in Bengali, but I can translate it to English to help myself understand better. 

Okay, the problem says: ""Bipasha's class has 13 (octal) students. Each has 56 (hexadecimal) pens. According to the decimal number system, how many pens do they have in total?""

Hmm, so first, I need to make sense of the numbers given because they are in different number systems. The number of students is 13 in octal, and the number of pens each student has is 56 in hexadecimal. But the question asks for the total in decimal, so I need to convert both numbers from their respective bases to decimal first.

Let me start with the students. 13 octal. So, octal means base 8. In decimal system, each digit represents a power of 8. The rightmost digit is 8^0, then 8^1, and so on. So, 13 in octal would be 1 times 8^1 plus 3 times 8^0. That would be 1*8 + 3*1, which is 8 + 3 = 11. So, there are 11 students in the class in decimal.

Next, the number of pens each student has is 56 in hexadecimal. Hexadecimal is base 16, and the digits go from 0 to 9 and then A to F representing 10 to 15. So, 56 in hex. Let's break this down. The rightmost digit is the units place (16^0), and the next is 16^1. So, 5 is in the 16^1 place and 6 is in 16^0. 

Therefore, 56 in hex is equal to 5 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0. Calculating that: 5*16 is 80 and 6*1 is 6, so 80 + 6 equals 86. So, each student has 86 pens in decimal.

Now, I need to find the total number of pens. That would be the number of students multiplied by the number of pens each has. So, 11 students times 86 pens each.

Let me calculate this multiplication. 11 times 80 is "

First, I recognize that this problem involves the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum before and after a collision or explosion remains unchanged.

I identify the given values: the mass of the bullet is 5 grams, which is 0.005 kg, and the mass of the gun is 1 kg. The gun experiences a recoil velocity of 2 m/s.

Next, I set up the momentum equation. The initial momentum is zero because both the gun and the bullet are at rest. After firing, the total momentum is the sum of the gun's momentum and the bullet's momentum.

I let \( v \) be the final velocity of the bullet. According to the law of conservation of momentum:

\( m_{\text{gun}} \times v_{\text{gun}} + m_{\text{bullet}} \times v = 0 \)

Substituting the known values:

\( 1 \times (-2) + 0.005 \times v = 0 \)

Solving for \( v \), I find that the bullet's velocity is 400 m/s directed in the opposite direction of the gun's recoil.

First, I need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The reaction produces sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and water (H₂O).

Next, I will calculate the molar masses of NaOH and CO₂. Sodium hydroxide has a molar mass of 40 g/mol, and carbon dioxide has a molar mass of 44 g/mol. Using these, I can determine the moles of each reactant present. The moles of NaOH are 0.25 mol, and the moles of CO₂ are approximately 0.1136 mol.

By analyzing the balanced equation, I see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO₂. This means that the mole ratio of NaOH to CO₂ is 2:1. To find the limiting reactant, I compare the available moles to this ratio. Since there are more moles of NaOH than required, CO₂ is the limiting reactant in this reaction.

Once CO₂ is consumed, 0.1136 mol of CO₂ will react with 0.2273 mol of NaOH. Subtracting this from the initial moles of NaOH gives the remaining moles of NaOH after the reaction. Finally, I will convert the remaining moles back to grams to find the mass of NaOH left.

First, I note that the problem involves finding the length of an arc in a circle. The circle has a radius of 5 cm, and the central angle corresponding to the arc is 60 degrees.

I recall the formula for calculating the length of an arc when the central angle is given. It is \( \text{Arc Length} = 2\pi r \times \frac{\theta}{360} \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees.

Substituting the given values into the formula, where \( r = 5 \) cm and \( \theta = 60 \) degrees, I calculate:

\[ \text{Arc Length} = 2 \times \pi \times 5 \times \frac{60}{360} \]

Simplifying the fraction \( \frac{60}{360} \) reduces to \( \frac{1}{6} \), so the equation becomes:

\[ \text{Arc Length} = \frac{10\pi}{6} \]

This simplifies further to approximately \( 5.236 \) centimeters when using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \).

Therefore, the length of the arc is approximately 5.24 cm.

Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a square, and the diagonal is √2 centimeters long. We need to find the area of the square in square centimeters.

Hmm, I remember that in a square, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are equal too. I also recall there's a relationship between the side length and the diagonal. I think it has something to do with the Pythagorean theorem because in a square, the diagonal splits it into two right-angled triangles.

Okay, let's visualize the square. Let's say each side of the square is 's' centimeters. When we draw a diagonal, it divides the square into two congruent right-angled triangles. In each triangle, the two legs are both 's' and the hypotenuse is the diagonal, which is √2 cm.

So, according to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, (leg1)^2 + (leg2)^2 = (hypotenuse)^2. Plugging in our values, that would be s^2 + s^2 = (√2)^2.

Simplifying that, we get 2s^2 = 2, since (√2)^2 is 2. So, dividing both sides by 2 gives us s^2 = 1. That means s is the square root of 1, so s = 1 cm.

Wait, but the area of the square is side length squared, right? Since the side is 1 cm, then the area is 1^2, which is 1 square centimeter. That makes sense because ∫√2 is approximately 1.414 cm, which is a reasonable length for the diagonal of a unit square.

Alternatively, I remember there's a formula that relates the diagonal of a square directly to the area. The formula is area = (diagonal^2)/2. Let me try that to double-check.

Given that the diagonal is √2 cm, plugging it into the formula: area = (√2)^2 / 2 = 2/2 = 1 cm². Yep, that matches what I got earlier.

So, whether I use the Pythagorean theorem step by step or the direct formula, I end up with the same answer: the area is 1 square centimeter. That must be the correct solution.

First, I need to calculate the circumference of the circular path using the formula \( C = 2\pi r \), where \( r = 10 \) meters. This gives me \( C = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 10 = 62.832 \) meters.

Next, I find one-fourth of the circumference by dividing the total circumference by 4, which results in \( \frac{62.832}{4} = 15.708 \) meters.

Since the displacement in a circular path is equal to the distance traveled when moving along a chord, the displacement for traveling one-fourth of the circumference is the length of the chord. However, in a circular path, the displacement when covering a quarter of the circumference is equal to the square root of \( 2r^2 - 2r^2\cos\theta \), where \( \theta = 90^\circ \) for a quarter circle.

Using the values, the displacement is \( \sqrt{2 \times 10^2 - 2 \times 10^2 \times \cos(90^\circ)} \). Since \( \cos(90^\circ) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \) meters, which is approximately 14.142 meters.

However, considering the problem's context, the displacement can also be interpreted as the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. For a quarter-circle, this distance is equal to the radius multiplied by \( \sqrt{2} \), resulting in \( 10\sqrt{2} \) meters or approximately 14.142 meters.

**Translation:**
On a circular path with a radius of 10 meters, what is the displacement in meters when one-fourth of the circumference is traversed?

First, I need to understand the problem. The wheel travels 4 kilometers, which is 4000 meters, and it makes 70 full rotations.

To find the distance covered in one rotation, I divide the total distance by the number of rotations. So, 4000 meters divided by 70 rotations gives approximately 57.14 meters per rotation.

The circumference of the wheel is the distance it covers in one full rotation. Since I have the circumference, I can find the diameter using the formula circumference = π times diameter. By dividing the circumference by π, I obtain the diameter of the wheel.

Finally, the diameter of the wheel is approximately 57.14 meters divided by 3.1416, which equals around 18.186 meters.

**Translation of the Problem:**
A wheel makes 70 rotations while covering a path of 4 kilometers. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Relationship Between Distance and Rotations:**
   - The wheel covers 4 kilometers in 70 rotations.
   - Convert kilometers to meters: 
     \[
     4 \text{ km} = 4 \times 1000 = 4000 \text{ meters}
     \]
   
2. **Calculate the Circumference of the Wheel:**
   - The distance covered in one rotation is the circumference (C) of the wheel.
   - Using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Number of Rotations} \times \text{Circumference}
     \]
   - Rearranging for circumference:
     \[
     C = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Number of Rotations}} = \frac{4000 \text{ m}}{70} \approx 57.14 \text{ meters}

3. **Determine the Diameter from the Circumference:**
   - The relationship between circumference (C) and diameter (d) is:
     \[
     C = \pi \times d

   - Solving for diameter:
     \[
     d = \frac{C}{\pi} = \frac{57.14}{\pi} \approx \frac{57.14}{3.1416} \approx 18.186 \text{ meters}

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a caliper with a main scale and a Vernier scale. The main scale reading is 5 mm, and the Vernier scale coincidence is at 16. The smallest division on the main scale is 0.5 mm, and it's given that 19 main scale divisions equal 20 Vernier scale divisions. We need to find the Vernier constant.

First, I remember that the Vernier constant is the value of one division on the Vernier scale, which can be calculated by understanding the relationship between the main scale and the Vernier scale.

Given that 19 main scale divisions equal 20 Vernier scale divisions, that gives a ratio. Since each main scale division is 0.5 mm, 19 divisions would be 19 multiplied by 0.5 mm. Let me calculate that: 19 * 0.5 = 9.5 mm.

Now, these 20 Vernier scale divisions are equal to 9.5 mm. To find the value of one Vernier division, I need to divide the total mm by the number of Vernier divisions. So, 9.5 mm divided by 20 equals 0.475 mm. 

But wait, I've heard that sometimes the Vernier constant is expressed in a standardized form, like 0.25 mm, but here the calculation gives 0.475 mm. That seems a bit unusual because typically, Vernier scales have constants like 0.1 mm or 0.2 mm. Did I do something wrong?

Let me double-check. The main scale has divisions of 0.5 mm, which is correct. The problem states that 19 main scale divisions equal 20 Vernier divisions. So, 19 * 0.5 mm = 9.5 mm for the main, which equals 20 Vernier divisions. So, each Vernier division is 9.5 / 20 = 0.475 mm. 

Hmm, maybe this is correct. I think different Vernier scales can have different constants based on their design. Normally, for a 20 division Vernier scale, each division would be 0.05 mm if the main scale is 0.5 mm, but here, since 19 main divisions equal 20 Vernier, that changes the constant. 

Wait, let's think about the formula. Usually, Vernier constant = least count of main scale / number of Vernier"

Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a cow tied with a rope in such a way that it can graze in a circular field with an area of 25 square meters. The question is asking for the diameter of the field. 

Alright, first, I need to understand the problem clearly. The cow can graze in a circular area, meaning the rope allows the cow to move in a perfect circle. The area of that circle is given as 25 m², and I need to find the diameter.

I remember that the area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. Since I have the area, I can solve for the radius first and then double it to get the diameter.

Let me write down the formula again: A = πr². I know A is 25, so plugging that in, I get 25 = πr². I need to solve for r. To isolate r, I can divide both sides by π, which gives me r² = 25/π. Then, to find r, I take the square root of both sides. So, r = √(25/π). 

Simplifying that, 25 is a perfect square, so the square root of 25 is 5. Therefore, r = 5/√π. But wait, I usually don't like having square roots in the denominator, so I can rationalize it by multiplying the numerator and denominator by √π. That gives r = (5√π)/π, but it's probably simpler to leave it as 5/√π unless specified otherwise.

Now that I have the radius, I need to find the diameter. The diameter is just twice the radius, so diameter d = 2r. Plugging in the value of r, d = 2*(5/√π) which is 10/√π. Again, rationalizing might be preferred, so 10√π/π.

But wait, let me check the calculation again because sometimes π is approximated as 3.14159, but since the problem doesn't specify to approximate, I should leave it in terms of π.

Wait, hold on. Let me go back. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me compute it step by step again.

好，我现在来解决这个数学问题。题目说有若干名学生，其中60人喜欢板球，40人喜欢足球，还有25人喜欢这两种运动。问题是至少喜欢其中一种运动的学生人数最少是多少。

首先，我需要理解题目中的数据。总共有喜欢板球的同学，有喜欢足球的，还有同时喜欢两种的。我需要找出至少喜欢一种的人数，这可能涉及到集合的概念，特别是容斥原理。

容斥原理的公式是：|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|。这里，A是喜欢板球的学生集合，B是喜欢足球的学生集合，A∩B是同时喜欢两种的人数，即25人。

代入数值的话，喜欢至少一种的人数就是60 + 40 - 25，也就是75人。那么，按照这个计算，至少有75名学生至少喜欢其中一种运动。

不过，我有点困惑的是，为什么这样计算可以得到至少喜欢一种的最小人数。实际上，容斥原理正是用来计算并集的大小的，所以这里得到的75确实是至少喜欢一种的人数，最小值应该是75，因为如果没有交集的话，人数会更多，而有交集的话，人数会减少。因此，这里的计算已经考虑了交集，所以75是正确的。

First, I need to calculate the total height the boy climbs. There are 20 steps, each 16 cm high, so the total height is 20 multiplied by 0.16 meters, which equals 3.2 meters.

Next, I should determine the time it takes for the boy to climb the stairs, which is given as 15 seconds.

Then, I can calculate the power using the formula Power = Work / Time. The work done is the boy's weight multiplied by the height climbed. The boy's weight is 40 kg, so the force due to gravity is 40 kg multiplied by 9.8 m/s², which equals 392 N. The work done is 392 N multiplied by 3.2 meters, resulting in 1254.4 Joules.

Finally, dividing the work done by the time (15 seconds) gives the power. So, 1254.4 Joules divided by 15 seconds equals approximately 83.6 watts.

Given the radius is 5 cm, I'll calculate the circumference by plugging the value into the circumference formula: \( C = 2 \times \pi \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 10\pi \, \text{cm} \).

Next, I'll find the diameter using the same radius: \( d = 2 \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{cm} \).

What is the probability of a draw in a test cricket match?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To determine the probability of a draw in a test cricket match, we can analyze the possible outcomes and their relative likelihoods.

1. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - **Team A wins:** Team A defeats Team B within the allocated time.
   - **Team B wins:** Team B defeats Team A within the allocated time.
   - **Draw:** Neither team wins within the allocated time, resulting in a tie.

2. **Assumption:**
   For simplicity, let's assume that each outcome is equally likely. This means:
   - Probability of Team A winning = 1/3
   - Probability of Team B winning = 1/3
   - Probability of a draw = 1/3

3. **Calculation:**
   The probability of a draw is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

   \[
   \text{Probability of Draw} = \frac{\text{Number of Draw Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}} = \frac{1}{3}

Alright, let's tackle this problem. It's about a right-angled triangle where the base is 3 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units. We need to find the height, which is the other side of the triangle. 

First, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies. That theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if we call the two sides 'a' and 'b', and the hypotenuse 'c', the theorem is a² + b² = c².

In this problem, one of the sides (let's say 'a') is 3, and the hypotenuse ('c') is 5. We need to find the other side ('b'), which is the height. Plugging the known values into the theorem, we get 3² + b² = 5². That simplifies to 9 + b² = 25.

Next, to solve for b², we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. So, b² = 25 - 9, which gives us b² = 16. To find 'b', we take the square root of both sides. The square root of 16 is 4, so b = 4.

Therefore, the length of the height (the side we were looking for) is 4 units.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
In a right-angled triangle, the base and hypotenuse are 3 and 5 respectively. What is the height?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let's denote:
- Base (one leg of the triangle) as \( a = 3 \)
- Hypotenuse \( c = 5 \)
- Height (the other leg) as \( b \) (what we need to find)

Using the Pythagorean theorem for a right-angled triangle:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation:
\[
3^2 + b^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
9 + b^2 = 25
\]

Solving for \( b^2 \):
\[
b^2 = 25 - 9
\]
\[
b^2 = 16

First, I need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a standard die. A die has six faces, each labeled with a unique number from 1 to 6. Therefore, there are 6 possible outcomes.

Next, I need to identify which of these outcomes are divisible by 3. To do this, I'll check each number on the die:
- 1 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1, so it's not divisible by 3.
- 2 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so it's also not divisible by 3.
- 3 divided by 3 equals 1 with no remainder, so it is divisible by 3.
- 4 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1, so it's not divisible by 3.
- 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so it's not divisible by 3.
- 6 divided by 3 equals 2 with no remainder, so it is divisible by 3.

From this analysis, the numbers 3 and 6 are divisible by 3. This means there are 2 favorable outcomes.

Finally, to determine the probability, I'll consider that there are 2 favorable outcomes out of the total 6 possible outcomes. This means the probability is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.

First, I need to determine the molar mass of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). 

The atomic mass of sodium (Na) is 23 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. 

Adding these together: 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol.

Next, I use the given moles of NaOH, which is 0.1 mol, and multiply it by the molar mass to find the mass.

So, 0.1 mol multiplied by 40 g/mol equals 4 grams.

Therefore, the mass of 0.1 moles of sodium hydroxide is 4 grams.

First, I need to understand the problem. There's a spherical ball with a diameter of 2 cm, so its radius is half of that, which is 1 cm. The ball fits perfectly inside a cylindrical box. Since it fits perfectly, the height of the cylinder should be equal to the diameter of the ball, which is 2 cm. Also, the radius of the cylinder must be the same as the radius of the ball to ensure the ball fits snugly, so the cylinder's radius is also 1 cm.

Next, I'll calculate the volume of the ball using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)πr³. Plugging in the radius of 1 cm, the volume of the ball becomes (4/3)π(1)³ = 4/3 π cm³.

Then, I need to determine the volume of the cylindrical box. The volume of a cylinder is given by πr²h. Here, the radius r is 1 cm, and the height h is 2 cm. So, the volume of the cylinder is π(1)²(2) = 2π cm³.

To find the unoccupied volume of the cylinder, I'll subtract the volume of the ball from the volume of the cylinder. That means subtracting 4/3 π cm³ from 2π cm³. To do this subtraction, I'll convert 2π to thirds by noting that 2π = 6/3 π. Subtracting 4/3 π from 6/3 π gives me 2/3 π cm³.

So, the unoccupied volume of the cylinder is 2/3 π cm³.

Alright, so I have this problem here asking about the percentage of carbon in carbon monoxide by mass. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that carbon monoxide is a chemical compound made up of carbon and oxygen. Its formula is CO, which means each molecule has one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. To find the percentage composition by mass, I need to consider the atomic masses of these elements.

Wait, what's the atomic mass of carbon? I think it's around 12.01 atomic mass units (amu). And oxygen, if I'm not mistaken, is about 16.00 amu. So, in one molecule of CO, the total molar mass would be the sum of these two.

Let me add them up: 12.01 (carbon) + 16.00 (oxygen) = 28.01 g/mol. Okay, so the molar mass of carbon monoxide is 28.01 grams per mole.

Now, to find the percentage of carbon in CO, I need to take the mass of carbon relative to the total mass of the compound. That would be (mass of carbon) divided by (total molar mass of CO) multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.

So that's (12.01 / 28.01) * 100. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 28 is approximately 0.4286, and when I multiply that by 100, it gives me about 42.86%.

Wait, but I should be more precise. Using 12.01 and 16.00 exactly: 12.01 divided by 28.01. Let me calculate that more accurately. Let me see, 12.01 divided by 28.01 equals approximately 0.4286, which is 42.86% when converted to a percentage.

Is there any reason this might not be accurate? Maybe if the atomic masses are slightly different in the problem's context, but generally, these are the standard atomic masses used. So I think this should be correct.

I guess another way to think about it is for every mole of CO, there's a mole of carbon atoms and a mole of oxygen atoms. So by mass, carbon contributes 12.01 g out of every 28.01 g of CO. So yes, that percentage makes sense.

First, I need to determine the initial velocity \( v_0 \) required for an object to take 10 seconds to hit the ground when thrown straight up.

I'll use the kinematic equation for vertical motion under gravity:
\[ y = v_0 t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]

Since the object starts and ends at the same vertical position, \( y = 0 \). Setting \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \) and solving for \( v_0 \):
\[ 0 = v_0 (10) - \frac{1}{2} (9.8) (10)^2 \]
\[ v_0 = \frac{4.9 \times 100}{10} = 49 \, \text{m/s} \]

Therefore, the initial velocity required is 49 meters per second.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
At what velocity must an object be thrown straight upwards so that it strikes the ground after 10 seconds?

**Solution:**

To determine the initial velocity \( v_0 \) required for the object to take 10 seconds to hit the ground, we can use the kinematic equation for vertical motion under constant acceleration (in this case, gravity).

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

- **Time of Flight (\( t \))**: 10 seconds
- **Acceleration (\( a \))**: Acceleration due to gravity, acting downward, \( a = -g = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- **Final Velocity (\( v \))**: At the moment the object hits the ground, the final velocity is equal in magnitude to the initial velocity but opposite in direction (since it was thrown upwards), so \( v = -v_0 \)

**Step 2: Applying the Kinematic Equation**

We use the kinematic equation that relates initial velocity (\( v_0 \)), final velocity (\( v \)), acceleration (\( a \)), and time (\( t \)):

\[
v = v_0 + a t
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
- v_0 = v_0 + (-9.8) \times 10
\]

Simplify:

\[
- v_0 = v_0 - 98

Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage composition of oxygen in water. Hmm, I remember that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to look at the chemical formula of water, which is H₂O. That tells me that each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Now, to find out the percentage of oxygen, I probably need to calculate the mass of oxygen relative to the total mass of a water molecule.

Wait, I should find out the atomic weights of hydrogen and oxygen. Oh right, hydrogen has an atomic weight of about 1 atomic mass unit (amu), and oxygen is around 16 amu. So each hydrogen atom is 1 amu, and the oxygen is 16 amu.

Since there are two hydrogen atoms in a water molecule, their combined mass is 2 * 1 amu = 2 amu. Adding the oxygen, the total molecular mass is 2 amu (hydrogen) + 16 amu (oxygen) = 18 amu.

Now, to find the percentage of oxygen, I take the oxygen's mass (16 amu) divided by the total mass (18 amu) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So that's (16/18)*100. Let me calculate that... 16 divided by 18 is approximately 0.8888, and multiplying by 100 gives about 88.89%.

Wait a second, is this right? So oxygen makes up almost 88.89% of water by mass. That makes sense because oxygen has a much higher atomic weight compared to hydrogen. I think I've got it. So in water, oxygen is the major component by mass percentage.
</think>

To determine the percentage composition of oxygen in water (H₂O), follow these steps:

1. **Chemical Formula**: Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H₂O).
2. **Atomic Weights**: 
   - Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu each.
   - Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu.
3. **Total Mass Calculation**:
   - Mass of hydrogen in H₂O: 2 * 1 amu = 2 amu.
   - Mass of oxygen in H₂O: 16 amu.

First, I need to convert the given moles of sulfuric acid to grams using its molar mass.

The molar mass of sulfuric acid, H₂SO₄, is calculated by adding the atomic masses of its constituent elements. Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of 1.008 g/mol, and sulfur (S) has an atomic mass of 32.065 g/mol. Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of 16.00 g/mol. Since there are two hydrogen atoms, one sulfur atom, and four oxygen atoms in sulfuric acid:

Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = (2 × 1.008) + 32.065 + (4 × 16.00) = 98.079 g/mol

Next, I'll use the relationship between moles and mass to find the mass corresponding to 0.1 moles of H₂SO₄. The formula used is:

mass (g) = moles (mol) × molar mass (g/mol)

Plugging in the values:

mass = 0.1 mol × 98.079 g/mol = 9.8079 g

Rounding to three decimal places for accuracy, the mass of sulfuric acid is approximately 9.808 grams.

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of subsets of the set A. The set A is given as A = {-1235, -290, 1347, 1567, 8922, 20334}. 

First, I remember that the number of subsets of a set is related to the number of elements it has. I think the formula is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements, so if the set has 'n' elements, the number of subsets is 2^n. Let me check that. Yeah, that makes sense because for each element, there are two choices: either it's included in a subset or not. So, for each element, the possibilities multiply by 2. 

Now, looking at set A, I count the elements. Let's see, there are six numbers there: -1235, -290, 1347, 1567, 8922, 20334. So that's 6 elements in total. 

Applying the formula, the number of subsets should be 2^6. Wait, what's 2^6? 2 multiplied by itself six times: 2 × 2 = 4, ×2 = 8, ×2=16, ×2=32, ×2=64. So 2^6 is 64. 

But wait, does this include all possible subsets, like the empty set and the set itself? Yes, I think it does. The empty set is a subset with zero elements, and the set itself is a subset with all six elements. So, they are both counted in the total of 64. 

Let me make sure there's nothing else I'm missing. The problem didn't specify any restrictions on the subsets, like non-empty or proper subsets. So I think the answer is indeed 64.

I think that's it. Just applying the basic formula for the number of subsets. It seems straightforward. No need to worry about duplicates or anything because all elements here are unique. Each is a distinct number. So yeah, 64 subsets in total.

The problem is asking for the number of subsets of the set \( A = \{-1235, -290, 1347, 1567, 8922, 20334\} \).

First, I need to calculate the molarity of the sodium sulfate solution. I have the mass of sodium sulfate as 17.75 grams and the volume of the solution as 250 milliliters.

To find the molarity, I'll use the formula:

Molarity (M) = (Mass of solute (g) / Molar mass (g/mol)) / Volume of solution (L)

The molar mass of sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) is calculated by adding the atomic masses of sodium (Na), sulfur (S), and oxygen (O):
Na: 22.99 g/mol × 2 = 45.98 g/mol
S: 32.07 g/mol
O: 16.00 g/mol × 4 = 64.00 g/mol
Total molar mass = 45.98 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 142.05 g/mol

Next, I'll convert the volume from milliliters to liters:
250 mL = 0.250 L

Now, plug the values into the molarity formula:
M = (17.75 g / 142.05 g/mol) / 0.250 L

Perform the division:
17.75 g / 142.05 g/mol ≈ 0.1249 mol
0.1249 mol / 0.250 L ≈ 0.500 M

Therefore, the molarity of the solution is 0.500 M.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
What is the molarity of the solution when 17.75 grams of sodium sulfate is dissolved in 250 milliliters of solution?

**Solution:**

To determine the molarity (\( M \)) of a solution, we use the formula:

\[
M = \frac{\text{Mass of solute (g)}}{\text{Molar mass of solute (g/mol)} \times \text{Volume of solution (L)}}
\]

1. **Calculate the Molar Mass of Sodium Sulfate (Na₂SO₄):**

\[
\text{Molar mass of Na₂SO₄} = (2 \times 22.99) + 32.07 + (4 \times 16.00) = 142.04 \, \text{g/mol}

First, I recognize that this is a simple interest problem where I need to calculate the interest earned over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ I = P \times R \times T \]

Here, the principal amount \( P \) is 10,000, the rate of interest \( R \) is 5%, and the time \( T \) is 10 years. 

I will convert the percentage rate to a decimal by dividing 5 by 100, which gives 0.05. Then, I'll multiply the principal by the rate to get the annual interest, which is 500. 

Since the time period is 10 years, I'll multiply the annual interest by 10 to find the total interest earned over the decade. This calculation shows that the total interest is 5,000.

Therefore, the total amount after 10 years will be the sum of the principal and the interest, which equals 15,000. 

This means that the profit earned is 5,000.

**Translation of the Problem:**
At a 5% interest rate, how much profit will be made from 10,000 Tk in 10 years?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

This problem involves calculating the interest earned over a period of time using the formula for simple interest:

\[
\text{Interest} (I) = \text{Principal} (P) \times \text{Rate} (R) \times \text{Time} (T)
\]

Where:
- \( P = 10,000 \) Tk (Principal amount)
- \( R = 5\% \) (Interest rate)
- \( T = 10 \) years

**Step 1:** Convert the percentage rate to a decimal.
\[
R = 5\% = \frac{5}{100} = 0.05
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute the known values into the interest formula.
\[
I = 10,000 \times 0.05 \times 10
\]

**Step 3:** Calculate the interest.
\[
I = 10,000 \times 0.5 = 5,000 \text{ Tk}

To determine the probability of getting at least one head when flipping two coins, I'll start by identifying all possible outcomes. Each coin has two possible results: Heads (H) or Tails (T). Since there are two coins, the total number of possible outcomes is calculated by multiplying the number of outcomes for each coin, which is 2 × 2 = 4. Listing out the possible outcomes: TT, HT, TH, and HH.

Next, I'll identify the favorable outcomes where there's at least one head. From the list, HT, TH, and HH all contain at least one head. This gives us 3 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes in total.

To find the probability, I'll divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability is 3 divided by 4, which equals 0.75 or 75%.

Therefore, the probability of getting at least one head when flipping two coins is 75%.
</think>

# Step-by-Step Solution:

**Problem:** In the case of flipping two coins, what is the probability of getting at least one head?

1. **Understanding the Possible Outcomes:**
   - When flipping two coins, each coin has two possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).
   - The total number of possible outcomes for two coins is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).
   - The possible outcomes are:
     - \( TT \)
     - \( HT \)
     - \( TH \)
     - \( HH \)

2. **Identifying Favorable Outcomes:**
   - ""At least one head"" includes outcomes where there is one head or two heads.
   - Favorable outcomes:
     - \( HT \)
     - \( TH \)
     - \( HH \)
   - Number of favorable outcomes = 3.

3. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - Probability (\( P \)) = \( \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \)
   - \( P = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \)

**Conclusion:**  
The probability of getting at least one head when flipping two coins is **75%**.

Okay, so I've got this problem about an object moving with uniform acceleration. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The question says that an object's velocity increases from 4 m/s to 8 m/s in 2 seconds, and we need to find its velocity after 4 seconds. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that uniform acceleration means the acceleration is constant. So, the object's velocity changes by the same amount each second. I think the formula for velocity under constant acceleration is v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.

But wait, I don't know the acceleration yet. I do know the change in velocity over 2 seconds, so maybe I can find the acceleration first. The change in velocity (Δv) is final velocity minus initial velocity, which is 8 m/s - 4 m/s = 4 m/s. This change happens over 2 seconds. So, acceleration a = Δv / Δt = 4 m/s / 2 s = 2 m/s². That makes sense because a higher acceleration would make the object speed up more quickly.

Now that I have the acceleration, I can find the velocity after 4 seconds. But I'm a bit confused about which initial velocity to use. Wait, the problem gives the initial velocity as 4 m/s at time t=0, right? So, using that, I plug into the equation: v = 4 + 2*4. Let's calculate that: 4 + 8 equals 12 m/s. So, after 4 seconds, the object should be moving at 12 m/s.

Wait, another thought. The problem gave a velocity increase over 2 seconds, so maybe I should check if the acceleration applies the same way beyond those 2 seconds. But since it's uniform acceleration, it's constant, so it should continue to apply. So, over the next 2 seconds (from 2s to 4s), the velocity would increase by another 4 m/s, taking it from 8 m/s to 12 m/s. Yeah, that checks out. So, I think 12 m/s is the correct answer.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Given Data:**
   - Initial velocity (\( u \)) = 4 m/s
   - Final velocity after 2 seconds (\("

Okay, so I need to find the percentage composition of chlorine in hydrochloric acid, which is HCl. Alright, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from chemistry that percentage composition by mass is calculated by taking the mass of the element divided by the molar mass of the compound, then multiplying by 100. 

First, I should figure out the molar masses of hydrogen and chlorine. Hydrogen is pretty light, I think it's around 1 g/mol. Chlorine is heavier, maybe about 35 g/mol. So, the molar mass of HCl would be the sum of those two, which is roughly 36 g/mol. 

Now, the mass of chlorine in HCl is 35 g because that's the atomic weight of chlorine. So, to find the percentage, I take 35 divided by 36, and then multiply by 100. Let me do the division: 35 ÷ 36 is approximately 0.9722. Multiply that by 100, and I get about 97.22%. 

Wait, let me double-check the molar masses to be sure. Yes, hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol and chlorine is 35.45 g/mol. So actually, the molar mass of HCl should be 36.458 g/mol. Recalculating with that, 35.45 divided by 36.458 gives me around 0.972, which still leads to roughly 97.22%. 

I think that's correct. So, chlorine makes up approximately 97.22% of the mass in hydrochloric acid.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Chemical Formula:** Hydrochloric acid is HCl, consisting of one hydrogen (H) atom and one chlorine (Cl) atom.

2. **Molar Mass Calculation:**
   - Molar mass of H: 1.008 g/mol
   - Molar mass of Cl: 35.45 g/mol
   - Molar mass of HCl: 1.008 + 35.45 = 36.458 g/mol

3. **Mass Percentage of Cl:**
   - Use the formula: (Mass of Cl / Molar mass of HCl) × 100
   - Calculation: (35.45 / 36.458) × 100 ≈ 97.22%

First, identify the given values from the problem. The area of the pond is 0.30 square meters and the height (depth) is 0.20 meters. The mass of the glycerin required to fill the pond is 75.6 kilograms.

Next, calculate the volume of the pond. Since the pond is rectangular, the volume can be found by multiplying the area by the height:
Volume = Area × Height = 0.30 m² × 0.20 m = 0.06 cubic meters.

Convert the mass of glycerin from kilograms to grams to match the desired units for density. There are 1000 grams in a kilogram:
Mass = 75.6 kg × 1000 g/kg = 75600 grams.

Now, calculate the density of the glycerin using the formula:
Density = Mass / Volume = 75600 g / 0.06 m³.

Perform the division:
75600 g ÷ 0.06 m³ = 1,260,000 g/m³.

Convert the density to grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc), knowing that 1 cubic meter equals 1,000,000 cubic centimeters:
Density = 1,260,000 g/m³ / 1,000,000 cm³/m³ = 1.26 g/cc.

Therefore, the density of the glycerin is 1.26 grams per cubic centimeter.

I will calculate the square of each leg: 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. Adding these together, 9 plus 16 equals 25. Taking the square root of 25 gives 5, which is the length of the hypotenuse.

Therefore, the hypotenuse of the triangle is 5 units long.

**Translation of the Problem:**
In a right-angled triangle, if the legs (height and base) are 3 and 4 respectively, what is the hypotenuse?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a right-angled triangle.
   - The two legs (the sides that form the right angle) are given:
     - Height (one leg) = 3 units
     - Base (the other leg) = 4 units
   - We need to find the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

2. **Recall the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - The Pythagorean theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle and is expressed as:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = c^2
     \]
     Where:
     - \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two legs.
     - \( c \) is the length of the hypotenuse.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     3^2 + 4^2 = c^2
     \]
     \[
     9 + 16 = c^2
     \]
     \[
     25 = c^2
     \]

4. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - To find \( c \), take the square root of both sides of the equation:

Let me try to figure this out. So, there's a 2 kg object being dropped from a height of 60 meters. We need to compare its kinetic energy when it's 10 meters above the ground to its potential energy at that point.

Okay, first, potential energy (PE) is calculated using the formula PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. The kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². But since the object is just being dropped, I can probably use energy conservation here. So, at the highest point (60m), all energy is potential, and as it falls, some of that potential energy converts to kinetic.

Wait, but the question isn't asking for the kinetic energy at 10m; it's asking for how many times greater the kinetic energy is compared to the potential energy at that point. So, I need to find KE at 10m and PE at 10m, then take the ratio.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total mechanical energy should stay the same, right? So at the top, total energy is PE_initial = mgh_initial. As it falls to 10m, some PE is lost and becomes KE. So at 10m, PE = mgh_final, and KE = PE_initial - PE_final.

Wait, so KE at 10m is PE_initial - PE_final. Then, to find KE / PE at 10m, it's (PE_initial - PE_final) / PE_final. Let me plug in the numbers.

m is 2 kg, g is 9.8 m/s². PE_initial is 2 * 9.8 * 60. PE_final is 2 * 9.8 * 10. So KE at 10m is (2*9.8*60) - (2*9.8*10) = 2*9.8*(60 - 10) = 2*9.8*50 = 980 J. PE at 10m is 2*9.8*10 = 196 J. So KE / PE is 980 / 196 = 5.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I could think about velocity at 10m using v² = u² + 2gh. Since u=0 (dropped), v²=2g(60-10) = 2"

Aitespace. So I've got this problem here: the set A is {1, 4, 6, 8}. I need to find out how many ordered pairs there are in A cross A, which is written as A x A. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I remember that when we talk about the Cartesian product of a set with itself, like A x A, we're essentially pairing each element of A with every element in A, including itself. So that includes all possible combinations where the first element is from A and the second element is also from A.

Now, the set A has four elements: 1, 4, 6, and 8. So, if I think about it, for each element in A, I can pair it with each of the four elements. That means for the first element, say 1, I can pair it with 1, 4, 6, and 8. That's four ordered pairs right there: (1,1), (1,4), (1,6), and (1,8).

Wait, but since the set has four elements, and each element pairs with four others, does that mean the total number of ordered pairs is 4 times 4? So that's 16. Let me make sure I'm not missing something here.

Let me try listing them out to be sure. Starting with 1 as the first element:
- (1,1)
- (1,4)
- (1,6)
- (1,8)

That's four pairs. Now, moving on to 4 as the first element:
- (4,1)
- (4,4)
- (4,6)
- (4,8)

Another four, making it eight so far. Next, 6 as the first element:
- (6,1)
- (6,4)
- (6,6)
- (6,8)

That's twelve now. Finally, 8 as the first element:
- (8,1)
- (8,4)
- (8,6)
- (8,8)

That adds the last four, bringing the total to sixteen ordered pairs. Okay, that seems consistent.

I think the key here is understanding that in a Cartesian product, the order matters and repetition is allowed. So, each element pairs with every element, including itself, and the order in which they appear matters, making (a,b)"

不过，等等，我是不是哪里理解错了？题目中说“lastic হলুদ”，也就是“yellow”对吗？确实是的。那袋子里只有白色、黑色和红色球，没有黄色球。这意味着黄色球的数量是零。

接下来，我计算总球数。15白+10黑+20红=45个球。所以总共有45个球，但没有一个是黄色的，因此黄色球的数量是0。

那么，抽到黄色球的概率就是黄色球的数量除以总球数，即0/45=0。所以概率是零。

   The problem states that the difference in the circumferences of two wheels is 120 centimeters, and we need to find the difference in their diameters in centimeters.

2. **Understand the relationship between circumference and diameter:**

   The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by \( C = \pi \times d \), where \( C \) is the circumference and \( d \) is the diameter.

3. **Express the circumferences of the two wheels:**

   Let’s denote:
   - \( C_1 \) as the circumference of the first wheel with diameter \( d_1 \).
   - \( C_2 \) as the circumference of the second wheel with diameter \( d_2 \).

   Then,
   \[
   C_1 = \pi \times d_1
   \]
   \[
   C_2 = \pi \times d_2
   \]

4. **Set up the equation for the difference in circumferences:**

   According to the problem, the difference in circumferences is 120 cm:
   \[
   C_1 - C_2 = 120 \, \text{cm}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \):
   \[
   \pi \times d_1 - \pi \times d_2 = 120 \, \text{cm}
   \]

5. **Factor out \( \pi \) from the equation:**

   \[
   \pi (d_1 - d_2) = 120 \, \text{cm}
   \]

6. **Solve for the difference in diameters:**

   To find \( d_1 - d_2 \), divide both sides of the equation by \( \pi \):
   \[
   d_1 - d_2 = \frac{120 \, \text{cm}}{\pi}

First, I need to determine the formula and molar mass of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃). The molar mass is calculated by adding the atomic masses of sodium (Na), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). Each sodium atom has a molar mass of approximately 22.99 g/mol, carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, and each oxygen atom is 16.00 g/mol. So, the molar mass of Na₂CO₃ is 2*(22.99) + 12.01 + 3*(16.00) = 105.99 g/mol.

Next, the problem states that the solution needs to be semimolar, which means a concentration of 0.5 moles per liter (M). The total volume of the solution is 2 liters. Using the formula for concentration, which is moles = concentration (M) * volume (L), the required moles of Na₂CO₃ are 0.5 M * 2 L = 1 mole.

Finally, to find the mass of sodium carbonate needed, I multiply the number of moles by the molar mass. So, 1 mole * 105.99 g/mol = 105.99 grams. This is the amount of Na₂CO₃ that should be added to the 2-liter solution to make it semimolar.

Next, I use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is \(\pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The radius of the cylinder is provided as 3 cm. Since the volume remains the same when melting and recasting, I set the volume of the sphere equal to the volume of the cylinder.

Today, I came across a math problem that I need to solve. It’s about probability, specifically dealing with dice. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says: ""If a die is rolled, how many favorable outcomes are there for getting an even number?"" Okay, so first, I need to understand what a die looks like. A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. Each number represents a possible outcome when the die is rolled.

Now, the question is asking about even numbers. I remember that even numbers are those that are divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. So, let me list out the numbers on a die and identify which are even.

The die has numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Checking each:
- 1: Odd because 1 divided by 2 is 0.5, which isn't a whole number.
- 2: Even because 2 divided by 2 is 1, a whole number.
- 3: Odd for the same reason as 1.
- 4: Even, since 4/2 is 2.
- 5: Odd.
- 6: Even, because 6/2 is 3.

So, the even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. That means there are three favorable outcomes when rolling the die that result in an even number.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The die only has six sides, and I've identified three even numbers. That seems right because half of the numbers from 1 to 6 are even. So, 3 out of 6 possible outcomes are favorable.

I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The problem is straightforward. So, the answer should be 3 favorable outcomes.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Die:** A standard die has six faces numbered from 1 to 6.
2. **Identify Even Numbers:** Even numbers between 1 and 6 are 2, 4, and 6.
3. **Count Favorable Outcomes:** There are three even numbers on a die.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are dealing with two independent events: rolling a die and flipping a coin.
   - The die has numbers 1 through 6.
   - The coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).

2. **Calculating Favorable Outcomes:**
   - **Die:** For the outcome to be divisible by 3, the possible numbers are 3 and 6.
     - So, there are 2 favorable outcomes for the die.
   - **Coin:** We are considering any side (H or T) which means both outcomes are favorable.
     - So, there are 2 favorable outcomes for the coin.

3. **Determining Total Possible Outcomes:**
   - The die has 6 possible outcomes.
   - The coin has 2 possible outcomes.
   - Total possible outcomes when both are considered are 6 * 2 = 12.

4. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - Multiply the number of favorable outcomes for each event and divide by the total possible outcomes.
   - Probability = (2/6) * (2/2) = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The probability of rolling a number divisible by 3 on a die and getting any side on a coin is 1/3.
</think>

### Translation:
When a die and a coin are tossed together, what is the probability of getting a number divisible by 3 on the die and any side on the coin?

### Solution:

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each event:**
   - **Die:** A standard die has 6 faces numbered from 1 to 6. 
   - **Coin:** A standard coin has 2 possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).

2. **Determine the favorable outcomes:**
   - **Die:** Numbers divisible by 3 are 3 and 6. So, there are 2 favorable outcomes.
   - **Coin:** Since ""any side"" is acceptable, both Heads and Tails are favorable. So, there are 2 favorable outcomes.

3. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - For two independent events, the total number of outcomes is the product of the individual outcomes: \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

First, I need to understand the relationship between the areas of the pistons and the forces applied in a hydraulic press. 

I recall that in a hydraulic system, the pressure exerted on both pistons is the same, and pressure is defined as force divided by area. Since the pressure is the same for both pistons, the force applied on the smaller piston times its area should equal the force on the larger piston times its area. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as F1 × A1 = F2 × A2. 

Given that the area of the small piston (A1) is 10 cm² and the force applied on it (F1) is 100 N, and the area of the large piston (A2) is 350 cm², I can plug these values into the equation to find F2. 

By rearranging the equation to solve for F2, I get F2 = (F1 × A1) / A2. 

Substituting the given values: F2 = (100 N × 10 cm²) / 350 cm² = 1000 N²/cm² ÷ 350 cm². 

Performing the division gives F2 ≈ 2.857 N. 

Therefore, the force exerted on the larger piston is approximately 2.857 Newtons.

**Problem Translation:**

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the Earth's radius is given as 6,440 km. Dinajpur and Rangpur create a 6-degree angle at the Earth's center. I need to find the distance between these two locations on the Earth's surface.

First, I remember that the Earth is considered a sphere for such calculations. The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the surface. So, both Dinajpur and Rangpur are points on this sphere.

The angle between them at the center is 6 degrees. I think this is the central angle. Now, I recall that the arc length between two points on a sphere can be found using the formula: arc length = radius × angle in radians.

Wait, the angle is given in degrees, so I need to convert it to radians first. To convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180. So, 6 degrees × (π/180) radians per degree. Let me calculate that.

6 × π = 6π radians. Then, divide by 180 to get radians. 6π/180 simplifies to π/30 radians. So, the central angle in radians is π/30.

Now, using the arc length formula: distance = radius × angle in radians. The radius is 6,440 km, so multiplying that by π/30 should give me the distance.

Let me compute this. 6,440 × π ≈ 6,440 × 3.1416 ≈ 20,216.784 km. But wait, I need to divide this by 30 because it's (6,440 × π)/30.

So, 20,216.784 divided by 30 is approximately 674.226 km. To make it precise, maybe I can round it off to the nearest whole number, so about 674 km.

But wait, is this the correct approach? Alternatively, sometimes people use the Earth's circumference to find distances. The Earth's circumference is 2 × π × radius, which is about 40,074 km. Since the circumference corresponds to 360 degrees, each degree is 40,074 / 360 ≈ 111.32 km per degree.

So, for 6 degrees, 6 × 111.32 ≈ 667.92 km, which is about 668 km. Hmm, that's a bit different from the previous calculation. Wait, why is there a discrepancy?

First, I recognize that this is a neutralization reaction problem involving potassium hydroxide (KOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).

The initial solution contains 56 grams of KOH dissolved in 0.5 liters of solution. The molar mass of KOH is 56.11 g/mol, so the molarity of the KOH solution is 56 g / 0.5 L / 56.11 g/mol, which is approximately 2 M.

Next, 18.25 grams of HCl is added to the solution. The molar mass of HCl is 36.46 g/mol, so the moles of HCl added are 18.25 g / 36.46 g/mol, which is 0.5 moles.

Since the reaction between KOH and HCl is a 1:1 molar ratio, 0.5 moles of HCl will neutralize 0.5 moles of KOH.

The initial moles of KOH are calculated by multiplying the molarity by the volume in liters: 2 M * 0.5 L = 1 mole. After neutralization, the remaining moles of KOH are 1 mole - 0.5 moles = 0.5 moles.

Finally, to find the mass of the remaining KOH, I multiply the remaining moles by the molar mass: 0.5 mole * 56.11 g/mol = 28.055 grams.

First, I need to write the chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) to form sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and water (H₂O). The balanced equation is:
2 NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O

Next, I'll calculate the molar masses of the reactants:
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) has a molar mass of 40 g/mol.
- Carbon dioxide (CO₂) has a molar mass of 44 g/mol.

Using the given masses:
- Moles of NaOH = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol
- Moles of CO₂ = 5 g / 44 g/mol ≈ 0.1136 mol

From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of NaOH to CO₂ is 2:1. This means that 0.25 mol of NaOH requires 0.125 mol of CO₂ for the reaction. Since only 0.1136 mol of CO₂ is available, it is the limiting reactant.

Using the mole ratio, the moles of Na₂CO₃ produced will be equal to the moles of CO₂ available, which is 0.1136 mol.

Finally, I'll calculate the mass of sodium carbonate produced:
Mass = moles × molar mass
Molar mass of Na₂CO₃ is 106 g/mol.
Mass = 0.1136 mol × 106 g/mol ≈ 12.04 g

Okay, so I need to find out how many moles of potassium carbonate are in a 750 mL solution that's 0.125 molar. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution. So the formula for molarity is M = moles/L. In this problem, the molarity is given as 0.125 M, which is 0.125 moles per liter. The volume is 750 mL, but I need to convert that to liters because the formula uses liters. 

To convert 750 mL to liters, I divide by 1000 since there are 1000 mL in a liter. That gives me 0.75 liters. Now that I have both the molarity and the volume in the correct units, I can use the molarity formula to find the moles of potassium carbonate. 

Rearranging the formula to solve for moles, I get moles = M * L. Plugging in the numbers, that's 0.125 moles/liter multiplied by 0.75 liters. Let me calculate that: 0.125 times 0.75. 

0.125 is the same as 1/8, and 0.75 is 3/4. Multiplying 1/8 by 3/4 gives 3/32, which is 0.09375 in decimal form. So that should be the number of moles of potassium carbonate in the solution. 

I think that's it. I can't think of any other steps or conversions needed here. The answer should just be 0.09375 moles.

Okay, so I've got this problem here in Bengali: ""প্রমাণ তাপমাত্রা ও চাপে ১ গ্রাম নাইট্রোজেনের আয়তন কত?"" which translates to ""What is the volume of 1 gram of nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure?"" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that standard temperature and pressure (STP) are defined as 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere of pressure. Okay, so we're dealing with those conditions. Now, nitrogen gas is what we're looking at here, specifically 1 gram of it.

I think gases behave according to Avogadro's Law, which relates volume to the number of moles. To use that, I'll need to know the number of moles in 1 gram of nitrogen. Let me recall the molar mass of nitrogen. Since the atomic weight of nitrogen is about 14.007 g/mol, and nitrogen gas is diatomic (N₂), the molar mass would be 28.014 g/mol. So, the molar mass of N₂ is approximately 28 g/mol.

Wait, but I have 1 gram of N₂, right? So to find moles, I divide grams by molar mass. Calculating that, moles of N₂ = 1 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 0.0357 mol.

Next step, use the molar volume at STP. From what I remember, one mole of any gas at STP occupies about 22.4 liters. That's a handy number to remember. So if I have 0.0357 moles, the volume should be 0.0357 mol * 22.4 L/mol.

Let me do that math: 0.0357 times 22.4. Hmm, 0.035 times 22 is 0.77, and 0.0007 times 22 is about 0.0154. So adding those together gives approximately 0.7854 liters. Rounded to two decimal places, that would be about 0.79 liters.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's recalculate: 22.4 * 0.0357"

Alright, I'm trying to solve this problem where an object is thrown straight up at 196 m/s, and I need to find its velocity after 10 seconds. Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that when objects are thrown upwards, they're subject to gravity, which pulls them back down. Gravity causes acceleration, but since it's acting against the direction of the initial velocity, it's a deceleration.

So, the initial velocity is 196 m/s upwards. I think the acceleration due to gravity is about 9.8 m/s² downward. Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, I can use the formula:

v = u + at

Where:
- v is the final velocity
- u is the initial velocity
- a is the acceleration (which will be negative because it's acting against the initial velocity)
- t is the time

Plugging in the numbers, u is 196 m/s, a is -9.8 m/s², and t is 10 seconds. So,

v = 196 + (-9.8)*10

Let me calculate that: -9.8 times 10 is -98. Adding that to 196 gives me 98 m/s. 

Wait, but does this make sense? After 10 seconds, the object is still moving upwards because the velocity is positive. Let me think—how high would it go? The time to reach the peak is when velocity becomes zero.

Using v = u + at, where v is 0:

0 = 196 - 9.8t

So, t = 196 / 9.8 = 20 seconds. Oh, so the peak is at 20 seconds. Therefore, at 10 seconds, it's halfway to the peak, so it's still moving upwards at 98 m/s. That makes sense.

I think that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculation to be sure. 9.8 times 10 is 98, subtracting that from 196 gives 98 m/s. Yep, that seems correct.
</think>

The problem involves an object being thrown straight upwards with an initial velocity, and we need to determine its velocity after a certain time. By applying the equation of motion under constant acceleration (gravity), we can calculate the final velocity.

1. **Understand the Problem:**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem where hydrogen and nitrogen gases react. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

We have 5 grams of hydrogen gas reacting with 30 grams of nitrogen gas. We need to find out how many moles of nitrogen will remain after the reaction.

First, I remember that when hydrogen and nitrogen react, they form ammonia (NH3). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. This means one mole of nitrogen reacts with three moles of hydrogen to produce two moles of ammonia.

Next, I think about the amounts we have. We're dealing with grams of each gas, so I need to convert these into moles to figure out the stoichiometry.

The molar mass of hydrogen (H2) is about 2 g/mol (since each mole of H2 has 2 grams). So, 5 grams of H2 divided by 2 g/mol gives us 2.5 moles of H2.

For nitrogen (N2), the molar mass is 28 g/mol (14 g/mol per nitrogen atom, times two). So, 30 grams of N2 divided by 28 g/mol equals approximately 1.07 moles of N2.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, the ratio of N2 to H2 is 1:3. This means that each mole of N2 reacts with 3 moles of H2. I want to see which reactant is the limiting factor. 

If I have 2.5 moles of H2, and each mole of N2 needs 3 moles of H2, then the amount of H2 that would react completely with N2 is 1.07 moles times 3, which equals 3.21 moles of H2 needed. But wait, I only have 2.5 moles of H2. That means H2 is the limiting reactant because there's not enough H2 to react with all the N2.

So, based on the amount of H2 available, how much N2 will"

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how much a steel beam will expand when the temperature increases from 60°C to 100°C. The beam is initially 20 meters long, and the linear expansion coefficient for steel is given as 11.6 x 10^-6 per Kelvin. 

First, I need to understand what linear expansion means. From what I remember, when materials are heated, they expand, and this expansion can be calculated using the coefficient of linear expansion. The formula for linear expansion is ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT, where ΔL is the change in length, α is the coefficient, L0 is the original length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

So, I should break this problem down into steps. The first step is to calculate the change in temperature. The beam is going from 60°C to 100°C, so ΔT would be 100 - 60, which is 40°C. But wait, since the coefficient is given per Kelvin, I need to make sure the temperature change is in Kelvin. I remember that a change in temperature in Celsius is the same as in Kelvin, so ΔT is 40 K in this case.

Next, I have the original length, L0, which is 20 meters. The coefficient α is 11.6 x 10^-6 per Kelvin. 

Putting it all into the formula, ΔL = 11.6e-6 * 20 m * 40 K. Let me calculate that. 

First, multiply 20 by 40, which gives 800. Then, multiply by 11.6e-6. So 11.6e-6 * 800 equals... let me do the math step by step. 

11.6 * 800 = 9,280. Then, 9,280e-6 meters is the same as 0.00928 meters. To express this in millimeters, since 1 meter is 1000 millimeters, 0.00928 meters is 9.28 millimeters. 

Wait, the question asks for the increase in meters, right? So actually, I don't need to convert it. It's 0.00928 meters. But maybe I should double-check my calculations to be sure. 

Let me recalculate: 11.6 x 10^-6 multiplied by 20 is 2.32 x 10^-4. Then, multiply that by 40"

Okay, so I have this problem: ""মিথেনে কার্বনের পরিমাণ কত শতাংশ?"" which translates to ""What is the percentage of carbon in methane?"" I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that methane is a chemical compound made up of carbon and hydrogen. Specifically, its chemical formula is CH4. That means each methane molecule has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. So, to find the percentage of carbon in methane by mass, I need to compare the mass of carbon to the total mass of the methane molecule.

I think I should start by finding the atomic masses of carbon and hydrogen. From what I recall, the atomic mass of carbon is about 12 atomic mass units (amu) and hydrogen is about 1 amu each. So, each hydrogen atom contributes 1 amu, and the carbon contributes 12 amu.

Next, the total mass of the methane molecule would be the sum of the mass of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. So that would be 12 amu (for C) plus 4 times 1 amu (for H), which adds up to 16 amu total.

Now, to find the percentage of carbon in methane, I should take the mass of carbon (12 amu) and divide it by the total mass of methane (16 amu), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So the calculation would be (12 / 16) * 100.

Let me do that division: 12 divided by 16. Hmm, 12 divided by 16 is 0.75. Multiplying that by 100 gives 75%. So, carbon makes up 75% of methane by mass.

Wait, let me double-check that. If methane is CH4, then yes, the total atomic mass is 12 + (4*1) = 16. Carbon's proportion is 12/16, which is indeed 0.75 or 75%. That makes sense because carbon is the heavier atom compared to hydrogen.

I think I've got it right. So the percentage of carbon in methane is 75%.

The problem asks for the percentage of carbon in methane (CH₄). Methane consists of one carbon atom (atomic mass ≈ 12 amu) and four hydrogen atoms (each ≈ 1 amu). The total molecular mass is"

To determine the diameter of the wheel, I first calculate the total distance traveled by the wheel, which is 3.225 kilometers or 3225 meters.

Next, I recognize that in one full rotation, the wheel covers a distance equal to its circumference. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = πd, where d is the diameter.

By dividing the total distance by the number of rotations (25), I can find the circumference of the wheel. This calculation gives me a circumference of 129 meters.

Using the circumference formula C = πd, I solve for the diameter by rearranging the formula to d = C / π. Substituting the circumference value of 129 meters into the formula yields a diameter of approximately 41 meters.
</think>

**Problem Translation:**
A wheel covers a path of 3.225 kilometers by rotating 25 times. What is the diameter of the wheel in meters?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Relationship Between Distance and Rotations:**
   - The distance covered by the wheel in one full rotation is equal to its circumference.
   - Let the diameter of the wheel be \( d \) meters.
   - The circumference \( C \) of the wheel is given by the formula:
     \[
     C = \pi \times d
     \]
     where \( \pi \) is approximately 3.1416.

2. **Calculate the Total Distance Covered:**
   - The total distance covered by the wheel is 3.225 kilometers.
   - Convert kilometers to meters:
     \[
     3.225 \text{ km} = 3.225 \times 1000 = 3225 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Relate Total Distance to Number of Rotations:**
   - The wheel rotates 25 times to cover 3225 meters.
   - Therefore, the distance covered in one rotation (the circumference) is:
     \[
     C = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Number of Rotations}} = \frac{3225}{25} = 129 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Solve for the Diameter:**
   - Using the circumference formula \( C = \pi \times d \):
     \[
     d = \frac{C}{\pi} = \frac{129}{3.1416} \approx 41 \text{ meters}

Okay, so I've got this problem here where a stone is dropped from a tower that's 2000 meters high, and I need to find out how long it will take to hit the ground. They also mention that the acceleration due to gravity, g, is 10 m/s². Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when an object is dropped, its initial velocity is zero because it's not moving at the moment it's released. So, the initial velocity, which is usually denoted as u, is 0 m/s. Acceleration is given as 10 m/s² downward, and the distance it needs to cover is 2000 meters. I think I need to use one of the kinematics equations for this.

I recall that the equation s = ut + (1/2)at² is useful here because it relates displacement (s), initial velocity (u), time (t), and acceleration (a). Plugging in the known values, u is 0, so the equation simplifies because the first term (ut) drops out. That leaves me with s = (1/2)at².

Substituting the known values, s is 2000 m and a is 10 m/s². So, 2000 = 0.5 * 10 * t². Simplifying the right side, 0.5 times 10 is 5, so the equation becomes 2000 = 5t². To solve for t², I divide both sides by 5, which gives t² = 400. Taking the square root of both sides, t should be 20 seconds. Wait, that seems a bit long for a fall from 2000 meters, but maybe it's correct because the square of the time increases as the height does.

Let me just double-check my steps. I used the right equation, s = ut + (1/2)at², and since u = 0, it's correct to simplify it. The numbers plug in correctly: 2000 = 0.5 * 10 * t² leads to t² = 400, so t is indeed 20 seconds. I think that's right, but maybe I should consider if there's another way to approach it, just to be thorough.

Alternatively, I could use the velocity-time equation, v = u + at. The final velocity when it hits the ground would be when s"

Alright, let me write down the formula: KE = ½ mv². I have KE as 1920 J, and mass m is 60 kg. I need to find v. So, I should rearrange the formula to solve for v.

If I multiply both sides by 2, I get 2KE = mv². Then, dividing both sides by m gives me v² = (2KE)/m. After that, taking the square root of both sides will give me v.

Plugging in the numbers, 2 times 1920 is 3840. Then, 3840 divided by 60 is 64. So, v is the square root of 64, which is 8 m/s. 

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from KE = (1/2)mv², yes, solving for v should involve those steps. Calculating 2*1920 gives 3840, and 3840/60 is indeed 64. Square root of 64 is 8. That seems right.

I think that's the correct approach. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so the runner's speed should be 8 meters per second.

First, I need to determine the molar mass of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This involves calculating the atomic masses of each element in the compound and summing them up.

Sulfur (S) has an atomic mass of approximately 32.07 g/mol. Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of about 1.008 g/mol, and oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of about 16.00 g/mol.

Since there are two hydrogen atoms, 32 hydrogen contributes 2 × 1.008 = 2.016 g/mol.

The sulfuric acid molecule has one sulfur atom, so that contributes 32.07 g/mol.

There are four oxygen atoms in the molecule, so oxygen contributes 4 × 16.00 = 64.00 g/mol.

Adding these together: 32.07 (sulfur) + 2.016 (hydrogen) + 64.00 (oxygen) = 98.086 g/mol.

This is the molar mass of sulfuric acid. Therefore, the molecular weight of 11 moles of sulfuric acid is 11 × 98.086 = 1078.946 g.

First, I need to understand the problem. The car is accelerating, and its speed increases over time. The initial speed is 36 km/h, then it increases by 18 km/h to 54 km/h after one minute, and finally increases by another 18 km/h to 108 km/h after the second minute.

Next, I should recall the formula for acceleration, which is the change in velocity divided by the change in time. Since the increases in speed are consistent at 18 km/h each minute, I can calculate the acceleration using this formula.

I'll convert the time from minutes to hours to match the units of speed in km/h. One minute is 1/60 of an hour.

Now, I'll plug the numbers into the acceleration formula: acceleration equals the change in speed divided by the change in time. Here, the change in speed is 18 km/h, and the time interval is 1/60 of an hour.

Finally, performing the calculation gives the acceleration as 10800 km/h², which is equivalent to 30 m/₂² when converted to standard units.

### Translation:
The car is traveling at 36 km/h and after 1 minute, its speed increases to 72 km/h. Then, after another minute, the speed further increases to 108 km/h. What is the acceleration of the car?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Given Data:**
   - Initial velocity (\(v_1\)) = 36 km/h
   - Velocity after 1 minute (\(v_2\)) = 72 km/h  
   - Velocity after 2 minutes (\(v_3\)) = 108 km/h
   - Time interval (\(\Delta t\)) = 1 minute = \( \frac{1}{60} \) hours

2. **Recall the Formula for Acceleration:**
   Acceleration (\(a\)) is defined as the change in velocity over the change in time:
   \[
   a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the Change in Velocity (\(\Delta v\)):**
   - From 36 km/h to 72 km/h:
     \[
     \Delta v = v_2 - v_1 = 72 \, \text{km/h} - 36 \, \text{km/h} = 36 \, \text{km/h}

First, identify the given information:
- Mass of the object (m) = 5 x 10^-2 kg
- Initial temperature (T₁) = 20°C
- Final temperature (T₂) = 100°C
- Heat added (Q) = 1520 J

Next, calculate the change in temperature:

Use the formula for specific heat capacity:
c = Q / (m × ΔT)

Plug in the values:
c = 1520 J / (0.05 kg × 80°C) = 1520 J / 4 J/°C = 380 J/(kg·°C)

I need to calculate the change in kinetic energy when the velocity of an object changes. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 * m * v². Given the mass m is 2 kg, initial velocity v_i is 3 m/s, and final velocity v_f is 5 m/s, I'll compute the initial and final kinetic energies separately and then find their difference.

First, calculating the initial kinetic energy:
KE_initial = 0.5 * 2 * (3)² = 0.5 * 2 * 9 = 9 J.

Next, calculating the final kinetic energy:
KE_final = 0.5 * 2 * (5)² = 0.5 * 2 * 25 = 25 J.

Finally, determining the change in kinetic energy by subtracting the initial from the final:
ΔKE = 25 J - 9 J = 16 J.

To determine the maximum height the object reaches when thrown vertically upwards at 19.6 m/s, I recognize that the vertical motion is influenced solely by gravity.

First, I identify the key variables: the initial velocity (u) is 19.6 m/s, and the acceleration (a) is -9.8 m/s² due to gravity acting downward.

Using the kinematic equation for vertical motion under constant acceleration, \( v^2 = u^2 + 2(a)(s) \), where \( v \) is the final velocity at the highest point, I set \( v \) to 0 since the object momentarily stops at the peak.

Solving for \( s \), the maximum height, the equation becomes:

**Problem Translation:**  
A object is thrown vertically upwards with a speed of 19.6 m/s. What is the maximum height the object will reach?

**Solution:**

To find the maximum height (\(s\)) of the object when thrown vertically upwards, we can use the equation of motion under constant acceleration:

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2(a)s

Where:
- \(v\) = final velocity (at the highest point, \(v = 0\))
- \(u\) = initial velocity (\(19.6 \, \text{m/s}\))
- \(a\) = acceleration (\(-9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)) (negative because acceleration due to gravity acts downward)
- \(s\) = maximum height

First, I note that the ball has a radius of 3 cm. Since the ball fits perfectly inside the cube-shaped box, the diameter of the ball will be equal to the edge length of the cube. 

To find the edge length of the cube, I calculate the diameter of the ball by doubling the radius: 3 cm * 2 = 6 cm.

Once I have the edge length of the cube, I can calculate the volume of the box using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is edge length raised to the power of three. 

Finally, plugging in the edge length, the volume of the box is 6 cm * 6 cm * 6 cm, which equals 216 cubic centimeters.

Alright, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. So, let's see what it says. There's a 10-gram object being dropped from a height of 60 meters above the ground. The question is asking at what height from the ground the object's potential energy will be five times its kinetic energy.

Hmm, okay. First, I remember that in physics, potential energy (PE) is the energy an object has because of its position, and kinetic energy (KE) is the energy it has because of its motion. The formulas I think are PE = mgh and KE = ½mv². Yeah, that sounds right.

So, the object is in free fall, right? That means its initial velocity is zero, and it's accelerating due to gravity. I should probably use the equations of motion for an object under constant acceleration. Oh wait, since it's dropped, the only force acting on it is gravity, so acceleration a is g, which is 9.8 m/s².

The problem says the object is dropped from 60 meters. Let me think about the variables involved. Mass m is 10 grams, which is 0.01 kg. Initial height H is 60 m. We need to find the height h where PE = 5 * KE.

Wait, but as the object falls, its potential energy decreases and kinetic energy increases. So, at some point above the ground, the PE will be five times the KE. After that point, KE will be more than PE.

So, let's set up the equation: PE = 5 * KE.

PE is mgh, where h is the height from the ground at that point. KE is ½mv², where v is the velocity at that height.

So, mgh = 5 * (½mv²). Let's write that down:

mgh = (5/2) mv²

Hmm, I can cancel out the mass m from both sides, which is good because it's non-zero. So, that simplifies to:

gh = (5/2) v²

Then, gh = (5/2)v². But I need to find h, which depends on v.

Wait, I need another equation to relate h and v. Oh right, from kinematics, the velocity v when the object is at height h can be found using the equation of motion. Since it's dropped from H, the velocity at height h is v = sqrt(2g(H -"

First, I need to translate the problem from Bengali to English to fully understand it. The problem states: ""If 24.5 grams of sulfuric acid is dissolved in 500 milliliters of solution, what is the concentration of the solution?""

Next, I'll identify the type of concentration being asked. Since the mass of solute and the volume of solution are provided, it's appropriate to calculate the weight/volume percentage.

I'll gather the necessary data: the mass of sulfuric acid (solute) is 24.5 g, and the volume of the solution is 500 mL.

The formula for weight/volume percentage is (Mass of Solute / Volume of Solution) × 100. Plugging in the values, I divide 24.5 g by 500 mL, which equals 0.049. Multiplying by 100 gives me 4.9%.

Therefore, the concentration of the sulfuric acid solution is 4.9%.

Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. So, the task is to find the probability that a randomly selected number from 10 to 21 is divisible by either 2 or 3. Hmm, okay. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the range of numbers we're dealing with. Numbers from 10 up to 21, inclusive. That means the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. To find out how many numbers there are, I'll subtract 10 from 21 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 21 - 10 = 11, and adding 1 gives us 12 numbers in total. So, the total possible outcomes are 12.

Next, I need to figure out how many of these numbers are divisible by 2 or 3. But wait, I shouldn't just add the numbers divisible by 2 and those divisible by 3 because some numbers might be divisible by both, and I'd be double-counting them. So, using the principle of inclusion and exclusion is probably the right approach here.

Let's find out how many numbers between 10 and 21 are divisible by 2. Divisible by 2 means even numbers. From 10 onwards, the numbers divisible by 2 are 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. That's 6 numbers.

Now, numbers divisible by 3 in this range. I can find this by dividing each number by 3 and seeing if it's an integer. Let's see: 12 ÷ 3 = 4, so 12 is divisible by 3. 15 ÷ 3 = 5, so 15 is divisible by 3. 18 ÷ 3 = 6, so 18 is divisible by 3. Then 21 ÷ 3 = 7, so 21 is also divisible by 3. So, we have 4 numbers: 12, 15, 18, 21.

But wait, some numbers are divisible by both 2 and 3. Those are the numbers divisible by 6. In our range, 12 and 18 are divisible by 6. So, 2 numbers are counted twice if I just add the two previous counts.

First, I need to identify the given information from the problem. The diameter of the metal sphere is 6 cm, so its radius is half of that, which is 3 cm. The cylinder created from melting the sphere has a height of 4 cm and an unknown radius.

I recall that when a sphere is melted to form a cylinder, their volumes remain equal. The volume of the sphere is calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, V_sphere = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Plugging in the value, V_sphere = (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cm³.

Next, I calculate the volume of the cylinder using the formula V_cylinder = πR²h, where R is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height. Since the volumes are equal, 36π = πR²(4). By simplifying this equation, I can solve for R², which gives R² = 9. Taking the square root of both sides, I find that R = 3 cm.

With the radius of the cylinder determined, I can now find the curved surface area of the cylinder. The formula for the curved surface area is 2πRh. Substituting the known values, the surface area becomes 2π(3)(4) = 24π cm².

Finally, evaluating 24π gives approximately 75.4 square centimeters.

   - Volume of a sphere formula: \( V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \)
   - Substituting \( r = 3 \) cm:
     \[
     V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (27) = 36\pi \, \text{cm}^3

Wait, 6.02 x 10²³ is Avogadro's number, which is the number of atoms in a mole. So, if I have one mole of oxygen, that's 6.02e23 atoms. And the molar mass is 16 g/mol, so one mole should weigh 16 grams.

But wait, the problem is asking for the mass of exactly those atoms, so that should be exactly one mole. Therefore, the mass is 16 grams. Yeah, that makes sense.

I think I've got it. So, the mass is 16 grams.

**Translation of the Problem:**
Calculate the mass of 6.02 × 10²³ oxygen atoms.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Given Data:**
   - Number of oxygen atoms (N) = 6.02 × 10²³ atoms.
   - Molar mass of oxygen (M) = 16 g/mol (grams per mole).
   - Avogadro's number (N_A) = 6.02 × 10²³ atoms/mol.

First, I need to determine the chemical formula of sodium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is composed of one sodium atom (Na), one oxygen atom (O), and one hydrogen atom (H), so its formula is NaOH.

Next, I will calculate the molar mass of sodium hydroxide by adding the atomic weights of sodium, oxygen, and hydrogen. The atomic weight of sodium (Na) is approximately 23 g/mol, the atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16 g/mol, and the atomic weight of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 g/mol. 

So, the molar mass of NaOH is 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol.

Now, to find the percentage composition of oxygen in sodium hydroxide, I will take the atomic weight of oxygen in the compound and divide it by the molar mass of NaOH, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The oxygen contribution is 16 g/mol out of the total 40 g/mol. 

Therefore, the percentage of oxygen is (16/40) * 100 = 40%.

Alright, so I've got this problem here: ""How much heat is required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of ice by 1 Kelvin?"" Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First off, I remember that when dealing with temperature changes in substances, the key formula is Q = mcΔT. That's heat equals mass times specific heat capacity times change in temperature. So I need to figure out the specific heat capacity of ice. I think ice is water in solid form, so I should look up the specific heat of ice. From what I recall, it's about 2100 Joules per kilogram per Kelvin, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check that. Yeah, 2100 J/(kg·K) sounds right.

Okay, now the mass here is 1 kg, which is straightforward. The temperature change, ΔT, is 1 Kelvin. So plugging those values into the formula: Q = 1 kg * 2100 J/(kg·K) * 1 K. Let me do that multiplication. 1 times 2100 is just 2100. So the heat required should be 2100 Joules.

Wait a minute, does ice have any phase changes here? Oh, right, the problem only mentions increasing the temperature, not melting the ice. So we're staying in the solid state, no latent heat involved here. That means my earlier calculation holds without any extra steps for phase transitions.

Wait, another thought: sometimes specific heat capacities can vary based on sources. Did I get the right value for ice? Let me confirm quickly. Yes, 2100 J/(kg·K) is the standard value for the specific heat of ice. Okay, so no issues there.

Let me recap: mass is 1 kg, specific heat is 2100 J/(kg·K), temp change is 1 K. So Q = 1 * 2100 * 1 = 2100 J. That seems correct.

I think I got this. No other factors to consider since it's a straightforward temperature increase without phase change. So the answer is 2100 Joules.

Alright, so I need to find the value of gravitational acceleration 500 km above the Earth's surface. Okay, let's start by recalling the formula for gravitational acceleration. I remember that the gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation: F = G*(M*m)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the object, and r is the distance between the centers of the two masses.

Since we're looking for the acceleration, which is F/m, the formula simplifies to a = G*M/r². That makes sense because acceleration is force per unit mass.

Now, I need to identify the variables given in the problem. The Earth's mass (M) is 5.98 x 10^24 kg, and the Earth's radius (let's call it R) is 6.37 x 10^6 meters. The problem asks for the acceleration at a height (h) of 500 km above the Earth's surface. Wait, 500 km is 500,000 meters, so h = 5.0 x 10^5 m.

The total distance from the center of the Earth to the point where we're calculating the acceleration is r = R + h. Plugging in the numbers, that's r = 6.37 x 10^6 m + 5.0 x 10^5 m. Let me compute that. 

6.37 x 10^6 is 6,370,000 meters, and 5.0 x 10^5 is 500,000 meters. Adding them together gives 6,870,000 meters, which is 6.87 x 10^6 meters. So r is 6.87 x 10^6 m.

Next, I need the value of the gravitational constant G. I remember it's 6.674 x 10^-11 N*(m²/kg²). 

Now, let's plug everything into the formula a = G*M/r². So that's a = (6.674 x 10^-11) * (5.98 x 10^24) / (6.87 x 10^6)^2. 

First, compute the numerator: 6.674e-11 * 5.98e24. Multiplying these together... Let me see, 6.674 * 5.98 is approximately 39.86"

First, identify the given values: atmospheric pressure \( P = 93296 \) Pa, density of kerosene \( \rho_k = 800 \) kg/m³, and density of benzene \( \rho_b = 980 \) kg/m³.

Next, since both liquids are connected, the pressure at the bottom of the mercury column will be the same due to Pascal's principle.

Using the formula for pressure in a fluid column, \( P = \rho g h \), where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \) m/s²), set up the equations for both liquids.

Assuming the pressure exerted by the two liquids must add up to the atmospheric pressure, we can write:
\[ \rho_k g h + \rho_b g h = P \]

Factor out \( g h \) to get:
\[ g h (\rho_k + \rho_b) = P \]

Solve for \( h \):
\[ h = \frac{P}{g (\rho_k + \rho_b)} \]

Substitute the given values into the equation and calculate the height \( h \).

# Step-by-Step Solution:

**Given:**
- Atmospheric pressure, \( P = 93296 \) Pa
- Density of kerosene, \( \rho_k = 800 \) kg/m³
- Density of benzene, \( \rho_b = 980 \) kg/m³

**To Find:**
The height of the mercury column, \( h \)

**Step 1: Understanding the Principle**

According to Pascal's principle, the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest is the same in all directions. In this case, the atmospheric pressure supports a column of mercury.

However, in this problem, we have two liquids (kerosene and benzene), which suggests a combination of pressures from both liquids. Since both liquids are likely connected and exposed to the same atmospheric pressure, we can sum their individual pressures to find the total pressure they exert.

**Step 2: Using the Formula for Pressure in a Fluid Column**

The pressure \( P \) at the bottom of a fluid column is given by:

\[
P = \rho \cdot g \cdot h
\]

Where:
- \( \rho \) is the density of the fluid (kg/m³)
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \) m/s²)

First, I'll assign variables to represent the two angles. Let's call the larger angle \( A \) and the smaller angle \( B \).

Given that the sum of the two angles is 60 degrees, I can write the equation:
\( A + B = 60^\circ \)

Also, the difference between the two angles is 30 degrees, so:
\( A - B = 30^\circ \)

To find the values of \( A \) and \( B \), I'll solve these equations simultaneously. By adding the two equations together, the \( B \) terms cancel out:
\( (A + B) + (A - B) = 60^\circ + 30^\circ \)
This simplifies to:
\( 2A = 90^\circ \)
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
\( A = 45^\circ \)

Now that I have the value of \( A \), I can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( B \):
\( 45^\circ + B = 60^\circ \)
Subtracting \( 45^\circ \) from both sides:
\( B = 15^\circ \)

# Solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We are given two angles with their sum and difference. We need to find the larger of the two angles.

- Let the larger angle be \( A \) degrees.
- Let the smaller angle be \( B \) degrees.

Given:
1. \( A + B = 60^\circ \)  (Sum of the angles)
2. \( A - B = 30^\circ \)  (Difference of the angles)

**Step 2: Set Up the Equations**

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. \( A + B = 60 \)
2. \( A - B = 30 \)

**Step 3: Solve the Equations**

Add the two equations:
\[
(A + B) + (A - B) = 60 + 30
\]
Simplify:
\[
2A = 90
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
A = 45

**Step 4: Determine \( B \)**

I will convert the given masses of sodium and chlorine gas into moles:
- Moles of Na = mass of Na / molar mass of Na = 40 g / 23 g/mol ≈ 1.739 mol
- Moles of Cl₂ = mass of Cl₂ / molar mass of Cl₂ = 35.5 g / 71 g/mol = 0.5 mol

Since the reaction requires 2 moles of sodium for every mole of chlorine gas, I will determine the mole ratio:
- Required moles of Na for 0.5 moles of Cl₂ = 2 * 0.5 moles = 1 mole

Comparing the available moles of sodium (1.739 moles) to the required moles (1 mole), sodium is in excess, and chlorine gas is the limiting reactant.

Finally, I will calculate the moles of sodium chloride produced based on the moles of the limiting reactant:
- Moles of NaCl produced = moles of Cl₂ = 0.5 moles

Using the molar mass of NaCl, the mass of sodium chloride formed is:
Mass of NaCl = moles of NaCl * molar mass of NaCl = 0.5 moles * 58.5 g/mol = 29.25 grams

Okay, so I have this problem: ""প্রমাণ অবস্থায় ৫ মোল ফসফিন গ্যাসের আয়তন কত?"" which I need to solve in English. Let me break down what's being asked here.

First, I know that the question is about finding the volume of phosphine gas under standard conditions. Standard conditions, or STP, typically mean a temperature of 0°C (273 K) and a pressure of 1 atm. At STP, one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. That's the molar volume I remember.

So, the problem gives me 5 moles of phosphine (PH3) gas. Since it's asking for volume, and it specifies standard conditions, I can use the molar volume here. 

Let me recall the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, but at STP, the product of pressure and molar volume equals RT. Since P and T are standard, the volume per mole (Vm) is 22.4 L/mol. 

So, the calculation should be straightforward: volume equals moles multiplied by molar volume.

That would be 5 moles multiplied by 22.4 L/mol, which should give me 112 liters. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Some sources might use 22.7 L/mol for STP, but I think 22.4 is the more commonly accepted value. Also, does phosphine gas behave like an ideal gas under STP? Well, most gases do, especially at low pressures, and STP is low pressure. So, I think it's safe to proceed with 22.4 L/mol.

Another point to consider is units. Molar volume is in liters per mole, so multiplying by moles gives liters, which is what the question is asking for. So no unit conversion issues here.

Putting it all together:
Volume = n × Vm = 5 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 112 L.

I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. Let me just check once again with the ideal gas law to confirm.

Using PV = nRT,
At STP, P = 1 atm, T = 273 K,

First, I identify that the problem involves finding the central angle corresponding to a 14 cm arc in a circle with a radius of 7 cm.

Using the formula for the length of a circular arc, which is \( L = r\theta \), where \( L \) is the arc length, \( r \) is the radius, and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians, I can substitute the given values into the equation:

\( 14 = 7 \times \theta \)

Solving for \( \theta \), I divide both sides by 7:

\( \theta = 2 \) radians

To convert radians to degrees, I use the conversion factor \( 1 \text{ radian} = \frac{180}{\pi} \text{ degrees} \):

\( 2 \text{ radians} = 2 \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 114.59 \text{ degrees} \)

Rounding to two decimal places, the central angle is approximately 114.59 degrees.

Alright, let's see. I need to find out how much water in grams is produced when 1 mole of ethanol reacts with 1 mole of oxygen. Hmm, okay, first I remember that chemical reactions involve balancing the equations. So ethanol is C2H5OH, right? And oxygen is O2. The reaction should produce CO2 and H2O.

Let me write down the combustion reaction of ethanol. The general formula is C2H5OH + O2 → CO2 + H2O. Now I need to balance this equation. Let's count the atoms on both sides.

On the left: 2 C from ethanol, 6 H (from C2H5OH) and O is 1 from ethanol plus 2 from O2, so total 3 O. On the right, CO2 has 1 C and 2 O, and H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Wait, that's not balanced yet.

Let me balance the carbons first. I see 2 on the left and 1 on the right, so I'll put 2 CO2. That gives 2 C on the right. Now the hydrogens: ethanol has 6 H, so I'll need 3 H2O to balance the 6 H, since each H2O has 2 H. Now the oxygens: left side has 1 (from ethanol) + 2*O2 molecules = let's see, maybe 3 O2 would work? Let me calculate.

Wait, let's do it step by step. The balanced equation should look like this: C2H5OH + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O. Let me check:

C: 2 on left, 2 on right.
H: 6 on left (from ethanol), 6 on right (3*2 H2O).
O: 1 (ethanol) + 3*2 (O2) =7 O on left. On the right: 2*2=4 (from CO2) + 3*1=3 (from H2O) → total 7 O. Perfect.

So the balanced equation is C2H5OH + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O. Now, the problem gives me 1 mole of ethanol and 1 mole of oxygen. Wait, but the reaction requires 1 mole ethanol and 3 mo"

Alright, so I need to find the mass of 11.2 liters of ammonia at standard temperature and pressure (STP). Okay, first thing's first, I remember that STP is defined as 0°C or 273.15 K and 1 atmosphere pressure. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct, so I'll just go with that for now.

Now, to find the mass, I think I'll need to use the ideal gas law, which is PV = nRT. Where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. My goal is to find the mass, so I'll probably need to find the number of moles first and then convert that to mass using the molar mass.

But wait, what exactly is the value of R? I recall it's 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K when pressure is in atm and volume is in liters. Yeah, that sounds right. So R is 0.0821.

I know the volume V is 11.2 liters. Pressure P is standard pressure, which I believe is 1 atm at STP. Temperature T is given as standard, so that's 0°C, which is 273.15 K.

Now, plugging these into the ideal gas equation: n equals PV divided by RT. So n = (P * V) / (R * T). Let's compute that.

So P is 1 atm, V is 11.2 L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, and T is 273.15 K.

Calculating the denominator first: R * T equals 0.0821 times 273.15. Let me do that multiplication. 0.0821 * 273.15 is approximately 22.44 (since 0.0821 * 273 is about 22.41, and a bit more for the 0.15). I'll use 22.44 for R*T.

So n equals (1 atm * 11.2 L) divided by 22.44. That gives me 11.2 / 22.44, which is approximately 0.5 moles. Hmm, that makes sense because at STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies about 22.4 liters, so half of that would be about 11.2 liters."

Since 1 mole of water is 18 grams and 1 drop weighs approximately 5 grams, I can determine the number of drops in 1 mole by dividing 18 by 5. 

This calculation gives me 3.6 drops of water in 1 mole. 

Therefore, a single drop of water weighs about 5 grams, which means that one mole of water in a drop weighs 5 grams.
</think>

**Problem Translation:**
What is the mass of water associated with a single drop?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Mole Concept:**
   - A mole is a unit of measurement in chemistry that represents \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) particles.
   - For water, 1 mole weighs approximately **18.01528 grams**. This is known as the molar mass of water.

2. **Determining the Mass of a Single Drop:**
   - A single drop of water typically weighs about **5 grams**. This value can vary based on the size of the drop, but we'll use 5 grams as an average estimate.

3. **Calculating Moles in a Single Drop:**
   - To find out how many moles are in a single drop of water, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass of one drop}}{\text{Molar mass of water}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{5 \text{ grams}}{18.01528 \text{ grams/mole}} \approx 0.2776 \text{ moles}
     \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Since we are asked for the mass of water in one mole of a drop, and we've already determined that a single drop weighs approximately **5 grams**, this is the mass associated with 0.2776 moles of water.

**Conclusion:**
The mass of water associated with a single drop is approximately **5 grams**, which corresponds to roughly **0.2776 moles**.

First, identify the given values in the problem. The person's mass is 70 kg, the height they climb is 100 meters, and the time taken is 5 minutes, which needs to be converted to seconds. Gravitational acceleration is provided as 9.8 m/s².

Next, calculate the person's weight using the formula mass multiplied by gravitational acceleration. So, weight = 70 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 686 N.

Then, determine the power expended using the formula power = work divided by time. Work done in this context is equal to the weight multiplied by the height climbed, so work = 686 N * 100 m = 68,600 joules.

Convert the time from minutes to seconds: 5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds.

Finally, compute the power by dividing the work by time: power = 68,600 J / 300 s ≈ 228.67 watts.

Therefore, the person's power is approximately 229 watts.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Convert Time to Seconds:**
   - Given time = 5 minutes.
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds.
   - Therefore, 5 minutes = 5 × 60 = 300 seconds.

2. **Calculate the Work Done:**
   - Work (W) = Force (F) × Distance (d).
   - Force (F) in this case is the person's weight, which is mass (m) × gravitational acceleration (g).
   - Mass (m) = 70 kg.
   - Gravitational acceleration (g) = 9.8 m/s².
   - Weight = 70 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 686 N.
   - Distance (d) = 100 meters.
   - Work (W) = 686 N × 100 m = 68,600 joules.

3. **Calculate Power:**
   - Power (P) = Work (W) / Time (t).
   - Power = 68,600 J / 300 s ≈ 228.67 W.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The person's power is approximately **229 watts**.

First, I need to calculate the work done by the motor in lifting the object. The object has a mass of 100 kg, and it's lifted to a height of 10 meters. Using the formula Work = Force × Distance, the force required is the weight of the object, which is mass × gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²). So, Work = 100 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 10 m, which equals 9800 Joules.

Next, I need to determine the efficiency of the motor. The motor's power is given as 1 kilowatt, which is 1000 watts. Power is the rate at which work is done, so I can find the time it takes to lift the object by dividing the work done by the power. Time = Work / Power = 9800 J / 1000 W = 15 seconds. This matches the time provided in the problem, confirming that the motor is operating efficiently.

Finally, calculating energy loss involves comparing the input energy and the useful output. The input energy over 15 seconds is Power × Time = 1000 W × 15 s = 15000 Joules. The useful output is the work done, which is 9800 Joules. Therefore, the energy loss is Input Energy - Output Energy = 15000 J - 9800 J = 5200 Joules.

**Translation of the Problem:**
A 1 kilowatt motor is used to lift a 100 kg object 10 meters high in 15 seconds. How much energy is wasted in joules?

   - **Work done against gravity:**

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a molecule of ferric carbonate, which is written as Fe₂(CO₃)₃. I need to find out how many atoms are in one molecule of this compound.

First, let's figure out what ferric carbonate is made of. The formula tells me there are two iron atoms, each with a +3 charge, and three carbonate groups. Now, looking at the carbonate ion, it's CO₃²⁻. That means each carbonate has one carbon atom and three oxygen atoms.

So, in one carbonate group, there are 1 + 3 = 4 atoms. Since there are three carbonate groups, that's 3 * 4 = 12 atoms from the carbonate alone.

Next, I have two iron atoms in the formula. Iron is just Fe, so each one is a single atom. Therefore, the two iron atoms contribute 2 atoms.

Now, to find the total number of atoms in the entire molecule, I need to add up the atoms from iron and the carbonate groups. So, that's 2 (from iron) + 12 (from carbonate) = 14 atoms.

Therefore, one molecule of ferric carbonate contains 14 atoms in total.

First, I need to understand the problem. A stone is thrown upward with a velocity of 9.8 m/s, and we need to determine the time it takes to return to the ground. 

I'll start by recognizing this as a kinematics problem under constant acceleration, where the acceleration is due to gravity, -9.8 m/s². The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is acting downward.

Next, I'll choose the upward direction as positive. The initial velocity (u) of the stone is 9.8 m/s, the final velocity (v) when it returns to the ground will be -9.8 m/s, and the acceleration (a) is -9.8 m/s². 

I'll use the kinematic equation v = u + at to solve for time (t). Plugging in the known values, the equation becomes:

-9.8 = 9.8 + (-9.8)t

Simplifying this equation will allow me to solve for t, which represents the total time the stone takes to go up and come back down to the ground.

Finally, I'll calculate the time and present it as the final answer.

- Acceleration, \( a = -9.8 \) m/s² (downwards due to gravity)
- Final velocity when the stone reaches the ground, \( v = -9.8 \) m/s (downwards)

Problem: A = {3, 4, 5, 8} set-er shokti shet-er upadan sankhya kato?

Translation: What is the number of elements in the power set of the set A = {3, 4, 5, 8}?

Okay, so I've got this problem here. It's about sets and power sets. The set A is {3,4,5,8}, and I need to find the number of elements in its power set. Hmm, power set, right. I remember that the power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets of that set, including the empty set and the set itself.

Wait, how do I find the number of elements in a power set? Is there a formula for this? I think there is. Oh, right! If a set has n elements, then its power set has 2 to the power of n elements. So, the number of subsets is 2^n.

Now, looking at set A, it has 4 elements: 3,4,5,8. So n is 4 here.

So, applying the formula, the number of elements in the power set should be 2^4. Let me calculate that. 2^4 is 16. So, the power set of A has 16 elements.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I should think about why this formula works. For each element in the set, when building a subset, you have two choices: either include the element or not. So, for each element, that's a binary choice. Multiplying these choices together for all elements gives you the total number of subsets.

So, for the first element, 3, I can choose to include it or not. Similarly for 4, 5, and 8. So, the total number of combinations is 2*2*2*2, which is indeed 2^4, which equals 16.

Therefore, the number of elements in the power set of set A is 16.

A circle with a radius of 20 meters, what is the ratio of its circumference to its radius?

Translation:
The problem is asking for the ratio of the circumference to the radius of a circle when the radius is 20 meters.

Solution:
The circumference C of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius.

Given:
r = 20 meters

Substitute r into the formula:
C = 2π × 20 m = 40π meters

The ratio of the circumference to the radius (C:r) is:
C : r = 40π : 20

Simplify the ratio by dividing both terms by 20:
C : r = 2π : 1

Therefore, the ratio of the circumference to the radius is 2π:1.

First, I recognize that the volume of the metal remains constant when melting the sphere to form the cylinder. 

I'll start by calculating the volume of the original sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr³. With a radius of 3 cm, the volume is (4/3)π*(3)³ = 36π cm³.

Next, I'll determine the height of the cylinder. Since the volume of the cylinder is the same as the sphere, I'll use the volume formula for a cylinder: V = πr²h. Given the radius of the cylinder is 1 cm, I can solve for h: 36π = π*(1)²*h, which simplifies to h = 36 cm.

Now, I need to find the total surface area of the cylinder. The formula is 2πr(r + h). Substituting the known values: 2π*1*(1 + 36) = 2π*37 = 74π cm².

Finally, converting π to its numerical value (approximately 3.1416), the total surface area is 74 * 3.1416 ≈ 232.038 cm².

A metallic solid sphere with a radius of 3 cm is melted and recast into a cylinder with a radius of 1 cm. What is the total surface area of the resulting cylinder in square centimeters?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We start with a solid sphere made of metal.
   - The sphere is melted and recast into a cylinder.
   - The radius of the sphere is 3 cm, and the radius of the cylinder is 1 cm.
   - We need to find the total surface area of the cylinder.

2. **Key Concepts:**

   - We can equate the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder to find the height of the cylinder.
   - Once we have the height, we can calculate the total surface area of the cylinder.

First, I need to understand the problem. We are asked to determine the amount of copper required to prepare 2 liters of a 0.1 molar copper solution.

I recall that molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute (n) divided by the volume of the solution in liters (V). The formula is M = n/V.

Rearranging the formula to solve for moles of copper, we get n = M * V. Plugging in the values, n = 0.1 mol/L * 2 L = 0.2 moles.

Next, I need to convert moles of copper to grams. I know that the molar mass of copper (Cu) is approximately 63.55 g/mol. Using the formula grams (g) = moles (mol) * molar mass (g/mol), we can calculate the mass of copper required.

So, g = 0.2 mol * 63.55 g/mol = 12.71 grams.

Therefore, to prepare 2 liters of a 0.1 molar copper solution, 12.71 grams of copper are needed.

First, identify the given information:
- Volume of the solution (V) = 2 liters
- Desired solution concentration (m) = 0.5 molal (which means 0.5 moles of solute per kilogram of solvent)

Assume that the density of water is approximately 1 kg/L. Therefore, 2 liters of water weighs about 2 kilograms.

Use the formula for molality:
m = (moles of solute) / (kilograms of solvent)

Rearrange the formula to find the moles of solute needed:
moles = m * kg of solvent
moles = 0.5 * 2
moles = 1 mole

Next, use the molar mass of sodium chloride (NaCl):
Molar mass of NaCl = 58.44 g/mol

Calculate the mass of NaCl required:
mass = moles * molar mass
mass = 1 * 58.44
mass = 58.44 grams

Therefore, by adding approximately 58.44 grams of table salt (sodium chloride) to the solution, the solution will become semimolar.

First, I recognize that the problem involves finding the radius of a circular field. The problem states that the cow can graze an area of 144 square meters. 

I know that the area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. 

Substituting the given area into the formula, I set up the equation as 144 = πr². 

To solve for r², I divide both sides of the equation by π, resulting in r² = 144/π. 

Finally, I calculate the radius by taking the square root of both sides, so r = √(144/π). This will give me the radius of the circular field.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

The problem is to find the radius of a circular field where a cow is tethered such that it can graze an area of \(144\) square meters.

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - The area accessible to the cow is \(144\) square meters.
   - The cow can graze in a circular area because it's tethered by a rope.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Circle:**
   - The area \(A\) of a circle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \pi r^2
     \]
     where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

3. **Set Up the Equation with the Given Area:**
   - Substitute \(A = 144\) into the formula:
     \[
     144 = \pi r^2
     \]

4. **Solve for the Radius \(r\):**
   - To isolate \(r^2\), divide both sides of the equation by \(\pi\):
     \[
     r^2 = \frac{144}{\pi}
     \]
   - Take the square root of both sides to solve for \(r\):
     \[
     r = \sqrt{\frac{144}{\pi}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{\pi}}

First, I need to calculate the final momentum of the bullet. The bullet's mass is 20 grams, which is 0.02 kilograms, and its velocity is 500 m/s. Using the formula for momentum, which is mass multiplied by velocity, the momentum is 0.02 kg * 500 m/s = 10 kg·m/s.

Next, to find the average force exerted by the gun on the bullet, I'll use the impulse-momentum theorem. Impulse is equal to the change in momentum. Since the bullet starts from rest, the initial momentum is zero, and the change in momentum is the final momentum of the bullet, which is 10 kg·m/s. The time over which the force is applied is 0.1 seconds.

Using the formula Impulse = Force * Time, I can solve for the force. Rearranging the formula, Force = Impulse / Time. Plugging in the values, the force is 10 kg·m/s / 0.1 s = 100 N. This is the average force exerted by the gun on the bullet during the firing.

Finally, to find the action and reaction forces, I recall Newton's Third Law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, the action force exerted by the bullet on the gun is also 100 N, but in the opposite direction.

   - The bullet achieves a velocity of 500 m/s over a time period of 0.1 seconds.
   - We need to find the average force exerted by the gun on the bullet.

2. **Given Data:**

First, I need to determine the chemical reaction involved when magnesium reacts with oxygen. Magnesium burns in oxygen to form magnesium oxide according to the equation Mg + O₂ → 2MgO.

Next, I'll calculate the molar masses of magnesium and oxygen to convert grams to moles. The molar mass of magnesium (Mg) is approximately 24.305 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O₂) is 32 g/mol (since each oxygen atom is 16 g/mol and there are two in O₂).

Then, I'll use stoichiometry to find the mole ratio between magnesium and oxygen. From the balanced equation, 2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O₂. So, for every 2 moles of Mg, 1 mole of O₂ is needed.

After determining the required moles of oxygen, I'll convert this back to grams by multiplying the moles of O₂ by its molar mass (32 g/mol).

Finally, I'll calculate the exact amount of oxygen needed for 12 grams of magnesium using the mole ratio and molar masses. This will give me the specific amount of oxygen required for the reaction.

**Translation of the Problem:**
How many grams of oxygen will react with 12 grams of magnesium?

   \[
   2\text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{MgO}

2. **Determine Molar Masses:**
   - Molar mass of Mg = 24.305 g/mol
   - Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol (since each O atom is 16.00 g/mol)

3. **Calculate Moles of Magnesium:**

Today, I've come across a math problem that I need to solve. It's about a square and its diagonal. The problem states that the diagonal of a square is 4√2 centimeters, and I need to find its area in square centimeters.

Let me try to visualize this. A square has four equal sides and all angles are right angles. The diagonal of a square stretches from one corner to the opposite corner, cutting the square into two congruent right-angled triangles.

I remember from my geometry classes that in a square, the length of the diagonal (d) is related to the length of its sides (s) by the formula d = s√2. This comes from the Pythagorean theorem, where the diagonal forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose legs are the sides of the square. So, if the diagonal is s√2, then to find the side length, I can rearrange the formula: s = d / √2.

Given that the diagonal d is 4√2 cm, I'll substitute that into the formula:

s = (4√2) / √2

Here, the √2 in the numerator and the denominator will cancel each other out, leaving me with:

s = 4 cm

Now that I have the length of one side, I can find the area of the square. The area of a square is given by the formula A = s². Substituting the value of s:

A = (4 cm)² = 16 cm²

So, the area of the square is 16 square centimeters.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The diagonal of a square indeed relates to the side length by the formula d = s√2. Plugging in the given diagonal:

4√2 = s√2

Dividing both sides by √2 gives s = 4 cm, which seems correct. Squaring that to find the area gives A = 16 cm².

I think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could have used another formula that relates the diagonal directly to the area. Since the area can also be expressed as A = (d²) / 2, let's try that approach as well.

Given d = 4√2 cm:

d² = (4√2)² = 16 * 2 = 32 cm²

Then, A = 32 / 2 = 16 cm²

Both methods lead me to the"

Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. It says that 750 mL of a potassium carbonate solution with 0.125 moles is prepared. Then, hydrochloric acid is added to the solution, and I need to find out how many grams of carbon dioxide are produced. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when an acid reacts with a carbonate, it typically produces carbon dioxide, water, and a salt. The general reaction is something like acid + carbonate → salt + water + CO₂. So in this case, the acid is HCl and the carbonate is K₂CO₃.

I think the balanced chemical equation is important here. Let me write that out. Potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃) reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce potassium chloride (KCl), water (H₂O), and carbon dioxide (CO₂). So the equation should be:

K₂CO₃ + 2HCl → 2KCl + H₂O + CO₂

Wait, let me check if that's balanced. On the left: 2 K, 1 C, 3 O from carbonate, plus 2 H and 2 Cl from HCl. On the right: 2 K, 1 C, 2 O from KCl, 1 O from H₂O, and CO₂ has 1 C and 2 O. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me count again.

Actually, K₂CO₃ is K₂CO₃, HCl is HCl. The products are KCl, H₂O, and CO₂. Let me balance it properly.

Carbon on the left: K₂CO₃ has 1 C. On the right, CO₂ has 1 C, so that's balanced.

Oxygen: K₂CO₃ has 3 O. HCl has O? No, HCl doesn't have O. So on the right, we have O in H₂O (1 O) and CO₂ (2 O), totaling 3 O. That's good.

Hydrogen: On the left, we have HCl, which has 1 H each. If I use two HCl, that's 2 H on the left. On the right, H₂O has 2 H, so that's balanced.

First, I identify the initial velocity of the toy car, which is 1 m/s, and its mass, which is 1 kg. Since the force applied is 1 N and there is no friction, the acceleration of the car can be calculated using Newton's second law: F = ma. Solving for acceleration, a = F/m = 1 N / 1 kg = 1 m/s².

Next, I determine the time over which the force is applied, which is 5 seconds. Using the equation of motion, the final velocity after applying the force is v = u + at = 1 m/s + (1 m/s²)(5 s) = 6 m/s.

Now, I calculate the initial kinetic energy (KE_initial) and the final kinetic energy (KE_final) using the kinetic energy formula: KE = (1/2)mv². Substituting the values, KE_initial = 0.5 * 1 kg * (1 m/s)² = 0.5 J, and KE_final = 0.5 * 1 kg * (6 m/s)² = 18 J.

Finally, the change in kinetic energy is the difference between the final and initial kinetic energies: ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial = 18 J - 0.5 J = 17.5 J.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about atomic mass. The question is in Bengali, and I need to solve it in English. Let's see... The problem says that the mass of one atom of an element is 4.482 x 10^-23 grams. I need to find its relative atomic mass. Hmm.

Alright, first, I should remember what relative atomic mass means. From what I recall, the relative atomic mass is the ratio of the mass of one atom of an element to the mass of one atom of carbon-12, which is taken as the standard. The carbon-12 atom has a mass of approximately 1.66053906660 x 10^-23 grams. So, the relative atomic mass (Ar) is calculated by dividing the given mass by this carbon-12 mass.

Wait, so the formula would be Ar = (mass of the element's atom) / (mass of carbon-12 atom). That makes sense because relative atomic mass is a ratio without units. So, if I plug in the numbers, it should look like Ar = 4.482 x 10^-23 g / 1.66053906660 x 10^-23 g.

Let me write that down step by step. First, I'll write the given mass: 4.482e-23 grams. Then, the mass of carbon-12 is 1.66053906660e-23 grams. Dividing these two should give me the relative atomic mass.

Calculating that, I can simplify the equation. Both denominators have 10^-23, so they cancel out. So it becomes 4.482 / 1.66053906660. Let me compute that. Hmm, 4.482 divided by approximately 1.6605. Let me do this division.

So 1.6605 times 2 is about 3.321, which is less than 4.482. The difference is 4.482 - 3.321, which is 1.161. Then, 1.6605 goes into 1.161 about 0.7 times, because 1.6605 * 0.7 is roughly 1.16235. So adding up, it would be approximately 2.7 times. Wait, but that can't be right because 1.6605 times 2.7 is approximately 4.483, which is very close to 4.482. So the"

First, I'll note that the problem involves a spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters that is half-submerged in water. The goal is to find the density of the sphere.

I know from Archimedes' Principle that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Since the object is half-submerged, the volume of the displaced water is half of the sphere's volume, which is 100 cubic meters.

The mass of the displaced water can be calculated by multiplying the volume of displaced water by the density of water, which is 1000 kg/m³. So, the mass of the displaced water is 100 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ = 100,000 kg.

For the sphere to be in equilibrium, the weight of the sphere must equal the weight of the displaced water. Therefore, the mass of the sphere is also 100,000 kg.

Finally, density is defined as mass divided by volume. By dividing the mass of the sphere (100,000 kg) by its volume (200 m³), I find that the density of the sphere is 500 kg/m³.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Data:**
   - Volume of the sphere (\( V \)) = 200 cubic meters
   - Fraction submerged in water (\( f \)) = 1/2

2. **Archimedes' Principle:**
   - The buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid.
   - \( \text{Buoyant force} = \rho_{\text{water}} \times g \times V_{\text{displaced}} \)

3. **Volume of Displaced Water:**
   - \( V_{\text{displaced}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 = 100 \, \text{cubic meters} \)

4. **Mass of Displaced Water:**
   - Density of water (\( \rho_{\text{water}} \)) = 1000 kg/m³
   - \( \text{Mass}_{\text{displaced}} = \rho_{\text{water}} \times V_{\text{displaced}} = 1000 \times 100 = 100,000 \, \text{kg} \)

5. **Weight of the Sphere:**
   - In equilibrium, the weight of the sphere equals the buoyant force.

Today, I have this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the area of a square when the length of its diagonal is given. Okay, let's start by understanding the problem.

So, the problem is in Bengali, but I can translate it to English for better grasp. It says, ""If the length of a square's diagonal is 8√2 cm, then what is its area in square centimeters?"" Alright, got it.

Now, I remember that for a square, the diagonal divides it into two right-angled triangles. Each triangle has the sides of the square as its legs and the diagonal as the hypotenuse. So, if I denote the side of the square as 's', then according to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship between the sides and the diagonal would be:

s² + s² = d²

Where 'd' is the diagonal. Simplifying this, I get:

2s² = d²

Which means s² = d² / 2

But wait, s² is actually the area of the square. So, if I can find s², that's directly the area I'm looking for. That's convenient!

Given that the diagonal 'd' is 8√2 cm, I can substitute this value into the equation:

Area = s² = (8√2)² / 2

Let me calculate (8√2)² first. Squaring 8 gives 64, and squaring √2 gives 2. So, 64 * 2 = 128.

Now, dividing that by 2, as per the formula, I get 128 / 2 = 64.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, if the diagonal is 8√2 cm, then each side 's' would be (8√2) / √2, since s = d / √2 for a square. That simplifies to 8 cm. Then, the area would be s², which is 8² = 64 cm².

Yes, that confirms my earlier calculation. So, the area is indeed 64 square centimeters.

To solve the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the relationship between the diagonal and the side length of a square:**

First, I identify the given values: the period of the wave is 5.8 × 10⁻⁴ seconds, and the speed of sound is 320 m/s.

Next, I recall that the wavelength of a wave can be calculated using the formula wavelength = speed / frequency.

Since the period is the reciprocal of the frequency, I can express frequency as 1 divided by the period.

Substituting the period into the frequency formula, I calculate the frequency as 1 / 0.00058 s⁻¹, which is approximately 1724.14 s⁻¹.

Finally, I divide the speed of sound by this frequency to find the wavelength: 320 m/s ÷ 1724.14 s⁻¹ ≈ 0.1856 meters.
</think>

Sure! Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Translation:**  
The period of a wave is \(5.8 \times 10^{-4}\) seconds, and the speed of sound is \(320\,\text{m/s}\). What is the wavelength in meters?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Period (T):** \(5.8 \times 10^{-4}\) seconds
   - **Speed (v):** \(320\,\text{m/s}\)

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   The wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a wave is related to its speed (\(v\)) and frequency (\(f\)) by the formula:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{v}{f}
   \]

3. **Find the Frequency (\(f\)):**
   Frequency is the reciprocal of the period:
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{T}
   \]
   Substituting the given period:
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{5.8 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1724.138\,\text{Hz}

4. **Calculate the Wavelength:**
   Substitute the values of \(v\) and \(f\) into the wavelength formula:

The problem requires calculating the heat absorbed by 5 kg of water when 0.5 kg of ice releases 769 kJ of heat. 

Heat released by ice when it melts: 
Using the formula Q = m * L, where m is mass and L is latent heat of fusion for ice (334 kJ/kg), 
0.5 kg * 334 kJ/kg = 167 kJ.

Now, the heat absorbed by water to raise its temperature by ΔT is calculated using Q = m * c * ΔT. However, without knowing ΔT, we cannot compute the exact temperature change. 

Assuming that all the heat released by the ice (167 kJ) is absorbed by the water to raise its temperature, we can find ΔT as follows:

167,000 J = 5 kg * 4186 J/(kg·°C) * ΔT
ΔT ≈ 6.35°C.

Thus, the water absorbs 167 kJ of heat, equivalent to the heat released by the ice.

**Translation of the Problem:**

""5000 g of water has 500 g of ice placed in it. If the ice releases 769 kJ of heat, how much heat is absorbed by the water in kJ?""

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have 5,000 grams (5 kg) of water.
   - 500 grams (0.5 kg) of ice is placed in the water.
   - The ice releases 769 kJ of heat.
   - We need to determine how much of this heat is absorbed by the water.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - When ice melts, it absorbs heat from the surroundings (in this case, the water).
   - The heat released by the ice equals the heat absorbed by the water, assuming no heat loss to the environment.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Since the entire heat released by the ice (769 kJ) is absorbed by the water, there is no need for further calculations involving specific heat capacities or temperature changes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The water absorbs all the heat released by the ice.

Alright, so I have this problem about a circle with a diameter of 2 centimeters, and there's a sector with a central angle of 90 degrees. I need to find the length of the arc, and it's asking for the approximate value. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = π times the diameter, so that would be C = π * d. Since the diameter here is 2 cm, plugging that in, C = π * 2, which is 2π cm. But wait, I also recall that the circumference formula can be written in terms of radius as C = 2πr. Since diameter is 2r, that checks out because if d=2, then r=1. So, 2π*1 is indeed 2π cm. Cool, so the circumference is 2π cm.

Now, the problem is about a sector, which is like a slice of the circle. The central angle is 90 degrees. I need to find the length of the arc for this sector. I think the formula for the arc length (L) is (θ/360) times the circumference. So, L = (θ/360) * C. Let me make sure I have that right. So, θ is the central angle in degrees, which in this case is 90 degrees. And C is the circumference, which we found to be 2π cm.

So plugging the numbers in: L = (90/360) * 2π. Simplifying 90 over 360, that's 1/4. So L = (1/4) * 2π. Multiplying that out, 1/4 of 2 is 0.5, so L = 0.5π cm. But 0.5π is approximately 1.5708 cm. Hmm, but the problem asks for the answer in centimeters, and they want it approximate. So, π is about 3.1416, so 1.5π would be about 4.712, but wait, no, wait—I think I messed up here. Let me recast this.

Wait, no. Since L = (θ/360) * 2πr. Wait, but actually, in this case, I used the circumference correctly as 2π because radius is 1 cm. So, L = ("

2. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - A standard die has six faces, numbered 1 through 6.
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

3. **Identifying Prime Numbers on a Die**:
   - Check each number between 1 and 6 to determine if it's a prime.

   - So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

5. **Total Possible Outcomes**:
   - A die has 6 faces, so there are 6 possible outcomes when it's thrown.

   - Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.
   - So, the probability \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

Okay, so I have this problem about radio waves and I need to find the wavelength. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem is given in Bengali, but I think it translates to something like: Dhaka radio center broadcasts a program on the medium wave at 630 kHz, and the speed of radio waves is 3 x 10^8 m/s. I need to find the wavelength.

Hmm, I remember from physics that wave speed is related to frequency and wavelength by the formula v = fλ, where v is velocity, f is frequency, and λ is wavelength. So, the velocity of the radio wave is given as 3 x 10^8 m/s, and the frequency here is 630 kHz.

Wait, kHz stands for kilohertz, which is thousands of hertz. So 630 kHz would be 630,000 hertz. I need to make sure all the units are consistent before plugging into the formula.

So, the formula rearranged to solve for wavelength would be λ = v / f.

Putting in the numbers, v is 3 x 10^8 m/s and f is 630,000 Hz.

Let me write that out: λ = (3 x 10^8) / (630,000)

Let me compute that. 3 x 10^8 divided by 6.3 x 10^5.

Wait, 630,000 is the same as 6.3 x 10^5, right? Because 630,000 is 6.3 multiplied by 10^5.

So, when I divide these, 10^8 divided by 10^5 is 10^(8-5) = 10^3, which is 1000. So, I have 3 divided by 6.3 multiplied by 1000.

3 divided by 6.3. Hmm, 3 divided by 6 is 0.5, but since it's 6.3, maybe approximately 0.476?

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 3 ÷ 6.3: Let's express 6.3 as 63/10, so 3 ÷ (63/10) = 3 * (10/63) = 30/63, which simplifies to 10/21, approximately 0.47619.

So, that's about 0.47619 multiplied by 1000,"

First, identify the given values from the problem. The initial velocity of Nasir's car is 10 m/s, and it takes 5 seconds to come to a complete stop after braking.

Next, use the equation for constant acceleration to determine the deceleration. The final velocity is 0 m/s after 5 seconds. Using the formula v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the deceleration, and t is the time, rearrange to solve for a.

Plugging in the values: 0 = 10 + a * 5. Solving for a gives a = -10 / 5 = -2 m/s².

The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is a deceleration. Therefore, the magnitude of the deceleration is 2 m/s².

Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The problem says that a natural number is randomly selected from 10 to 21, and we need to find the probability that this number is a prime number.

First, I think I should figure out how many numbers are there in total between 10 and 21. Well, from 10 up to 21, that's 12 numbers because 21 minus 10 is 11, but since we include both endpoints, we add 1, making it 12 numbers in total.

Next, I need to identify which of these numbers are prime. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, let me list out the numbers from 10 to 21:

10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

Now, I'll go through each one and check if it's prime.

Starting with 10: 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, so it's not prime.

11: Hmm, 11 is only divisible by 1 and 11. I think 11 is a prime number.

12: Definitely not prime, it's divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6.

13: Let me see, 13 divided by anything other than 1 and itself? No, so 13 is prime.

14: No, it's divisible by 2 and 7.

15: Not prime, divisible by 3 and 5.

16: No, it's 2 to the power of 4, so lots of divisors.

17: Let me check. 17 divided by 2? No. 3? 5? 7? 11? None of these divide 17 evenly, so 17 is prime.

18: Not prime, divisible by 2, 3, etc.

19: Checking 19. Divided by 2? 19 is odd. 3? 19/3 is not whole. 5? Ends with 9, so no. 7? 7*2 is 14, plus 7 is 21, which is over. So 19 is prime.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to find the molecular weight of 10 moles of carbon monoxide. Hmm, carbon monoxide is CO, right? So, first, I should figure out the atomic weights of carbon and oxygen.

I remember that the atomic weight of carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen is around 16.00 g/mol. Wait, I should make sure about those numbers. Yeah, from the periodic table, carbon is 12.01 and oxygen is 16.00. Okay, so each molecule of CO has one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. 

So, to find the molecular weight of CO, I just add the atomic weights of C and O together. That would be 12.01 + 16.00, which equals 28.01 g/mol. Got it. Now, the problem asks for the molecular weight of 10 moles of CO, so I need to multiply the molecular weight per mole by 10. 

Calculating that, 28.01 g/mol multiplied by 10 gives me 280.1 grams. Let me double-check that. 28.01 times 10 is indeed 280.1. Yeah, that seems right. So, 10 moles of carbon monoxide should have a molecular weight of 280.1 grams. 

Wait, does molecular weight change with the number of moles? Hmm, no, actually, molecular weight is the mass per mole. So, each mole is 28.01 grams, so 10 moles would be 28.01 times 10. Yeah, I think I did that right. So, the final answer is 280.1 grams.

1. **Translate the problem:**

   - Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of 12.01 g/mol.
   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of 16.00 g/mol.
   - Carbon monoxide (CO) consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom.
   - Molecular weight of one mole of CO: 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g.
   - Molecular weight of 10 moles of CO: 28.01 g/mol × 10 = 280.1 g.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a circle with a radius of 2 cm, and there's an arc that's 8 cm long. I need to find the central angle in radians corresponding to this arc.

First, I remember that the length of an arc in a circle is related to the radius and the central angle. But wait, is that in radians? I think so. Oh, right, the formula for arc length is something like L = rθ, where L is the arc length, r is the radius, and θ is the angle in radians. That sounds familiar.

Wait, let me make sure. In radians, the central angle is the same as the ratio of the arc length to the radius. Yeah, that's it. So, if I have the arc length and the radius, I can solve for θ by rearranging the formula. So, θ would be L divided by r.

Given that the arc length L is 8 cm and the radius r is 2 cm, I can plug those values into the formula. Let me write that down:

θ = L / r = 8 cm / 2 cm

Oh, the centimeters cancel out, which makes sense because radians are a unitless measure. So, θ = 8 / 2, which is 4 radians.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Sometimes, especially with geometry problems, it's easy to mix up the formulas.

Let me recall, the formula for the circumference of a circle is 2πr. With a radius of 2 cm, the circumference would be 2 * π * 2 = 4π cm. The full circle is 2π radians, right? So, 4π cm corresponds to 2π radians.

Now, the arc length here is 8 cm. How does that relate to the full circumference? Let me calculate 8 cm as a fraction of the full circumference.

Fraction = 8 / (4π) = 2 / π.

So, the central angle should be the same fraction of the full angle of 2π radians.

θ = (2/π) * 2π = 4 radians.

So, that matches what I got earlier. Therefore, I'm confident that the central angle is indeed 4 radians.

I think that covers it. Both methods lead to the same result, so I must be correct.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is: If Jisan's birthday is in January, what's the probability that it's on January 31st? 

First, I need to understand the basics. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is Jisan's birthday being on January 31st, and the total possible outcomes are all the days in January.

Now, let me think about January. I remember that January has 31 days, numbered from 1 to 31. So, that gives us 31 possible outcomes. Since Jisan's birthday is definitely in January, each day is equally likely, right? So, every day from 1 to 31 has the same chance.

So, the favorable outcome here is just one day: January 31st. That means the number of favorable outcomes is 1. The total number of possible outcomes is 31 because there are 31 days in January.

To calculate the probability, I take the number of favorable outcomes (which is 1) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (which is 31). So, mathematically, it would look like this: probability = 1 / 31.

Hmm, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If every day has an equal chance and there are 31 days, then each day should have a probability of 1/31. So, yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but I should consider if there are any leap years or something affecting the months, but in this case, since we're specifically talking about January, which always has 31 days, that shouldn't matter. So, no need to worry about that here.

So, putting it all together, the probability that Jisan's birthday is on January 31st is 1 divided by 31. To express this as a numerical value, I can calculate 1 ÷ 31, which is approximately 0.0322580645, or about 3.2258%. But since the question just asks for the probability, expressing it as a fraction in its simplest form is probably the best way, so 1/31.

I think that's it. It seems straightforward because all days are equally likely, making the probability uniform across each day in January. So, the chance is just one out of the total 31 days.

First, I need to determine the masses of the two objects involved. The masses are given as 15 kg and 10 kg.

Next, I'll identify the velocities of each object. The 15 kg object is moving at 3 m/s, and the 10 kg object is moving at 5 m/s. Since they are moving towards each other, the velocities will have opposite signs.

I'll choose a coordinate system where the 15 kg object's velocity is positive and the 10 kg object's velocity is negative. This means the 15 kg object has a velocity of +3 m/s, and the 10 kg object has a velocity of -5 m/s.

Using the principle of conservation of momentum, I'll set up the equation with the initial momentum equal to the final momentum after the collision.

Calculating the initial total momentum: (15 kg * 3 m/s) + (10 kg * (-5 m/s)) = 45 kg·m/s - 50 kg·m/s = -5 kg·m/s.

After the collision, the combined mass is 25 kg, and the final velocity will be the same for both objects when they stick together.

Finally, I'll solve for the final velocity using the equation -5 kg·m/s = 25 kg * v_final, resulting in a final velocity of -0.2 m/s.

**Translation of the Problem:**

Two objects of masses 15 kg and 10 kg are moving towards each other on the same straight road with velocities of 3 m/s and 5 m/s respectively. They collide head-on and stick together. What is their common velocity after the collision?

   - Velocity of object 2, \( u_2 = -5\ \text{m/s} \) (negative because it's moving in the opposite direction)

Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a 2 kg object that's dropped from rest, and it covers 36 meters in 3 seconds. We need to find its acceleration in meters per second squared.

Hmm, first, I remember that when an object is dropped, it's in free fall, so the only acceleration acting on it is due to gravity. But wait, sometimes in problems like this, air resistance might be considered, but I think here we can assume it's negligible since it's not mentioned.

Alright, so the formula for the distance traveled under constant acceleration is:

s = ut + (1/2)at²

Here, s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity, t is time, and a is acceleration. Since the object is dropped from rest, u = 0. So the equation simplifies to:

s = (1/2)at²

Plugging in the known values:

36 m = 0.5 * a * (3 s)²

Let me calculate 3 squared first. That's 9. So,

36 = 0.5 * a * 9

Simplify 0.5 * 9, which is 4.5. Now the equation is:

36 = 4.5a

To solve for a, I'll divide both sides by 4.5.

a = 36 / 4.5

Calculating that, 36 divided by 4.5. Let me see, 4.5 times 8 is 36. So, a = 8 m/s².

Wait a minute, the standard acceleration due to gravity is about 9.8 m/s². So this seems a bit low. Maybe I made a mistake. Did I use the right formula?

Let me check again. The displacement is 36 meters, time is 3 seconds. Using s = 0.5at²:

a = (2s)/t²

Wait, no, because s = (1/2)at², so solving for a gives a = 2s / t².

Let me recalculate using that formula:

s = 36 m, t = 3 s

a = (2 * 36) / (3)^2

That's 72 / 9 = 8 m/s².

Hmm, same result. So maybe in this problem, the acceleration is 8 m/s²."

Alright, so I need to figure out the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid. Hmm, okay. I remember that chloric acid is HClO3. Let me break that down. H stands for hydrogen, Cl for chlorine, and O for oxygen. So, the formula HClO3 means one hydrogen atom, one chlorine atom, and three oxygen atoms.

First, I think I need to find the molar mass of each element involved. I'm pretty sure the atomic masses are approximate, but I should get them right. Hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol, chlorine is around 35.45 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol each. Since there are three oxygens, I'll multiply that by three.

So, calculating the molar mass of HClO3: hydrogen is 1.008, chlorine is 35.45, and oxygen is 16.00 times three, which is 48.00. Adding those together: 1.008 + 35.45 + 48.00. Let me see, 1 + 35 is 36, plus 48 is 84, and then adding the decimals, it should be 84.458 g/mol.

Now, to find the percentage of oxygen, I think I need to take the total mass of oxygen and divide it by the molar mass of HClO3, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. The total oxygen mass is 48.00 g/mol. So, 48 divided by 84.458. Let me do that division. Hmm, 48 divided by 84.458... I think it's around 0.568 or so. Then multiplying by 100 gives about 56.8%. 

Wait, let me check if I did that right. 48 divided by 84.458. Let me use a calculator to be precise. Yeah, 48 ÷ 84.458 equals approximately 0.568, so 56.8%. That seems reasonable. So, oxygen makes up about 56.8% of chloric acid by mass.
</think>

To determine the percentage of oxygen in chloric acid (HClO₃), follow these steps:

1. **Determine the molar masses:**

   - Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol

First, identify the given sides of the right-angled triangle. The base is 12 units, and the hypotenuse is 13 units.

Recall the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the other two sides.

Here, one of the sides (the base) is 12, and the hypotenuse is 13. Let \( b \) be the other side (the height) we need to find. Plugging the known values into the theorem:

\( 12^2 + b^2 = 13^2 \)

Calculate the squares:

\( 144 + b^2 = 169 \)

Subtract 144 from both sides to solve for \( b^2 \):

\( b^2 = 169 - 144 = 25 \)

Take the square root of both sides to find \( b \):

\( b = 5 \)

Therefore, the height of the right-angled triangle is 5 units.

Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

**Problem (translated to English):**

First, I need to understand the problem. The question is asking about the number of proper subsets of a set that has 3 elements.

I recall that a proper subset is any subset of a set except the set itself. This means I need to calculate the total number of subsets and then subtract one to exclude the set itself.

The formula for the total number of subsets of a set with \( n \) elements is \( 2^n \). For a set with 3 elements, the total number of subsets would be \( 2^3 = 8 \).

Since proper subsets exclude the set itself, I subtract one from the total number of subsets. Therefore, the number of proper subsets is \( 8 - 1 = 7 \).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a set with 3 elements.

First, I recognize that the problem is asking about the buoyancy of a spherical object partially submerged in water.

I start by recalling Archimedes' Principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. For a floating object, buoyancy equals the weight of the submerged portion of the object.

Given the volume of the sphere is 200 cubic meters, when it is half-submerged, the submerged volume is 100 cubic meters. Since water has a density of 1000 kg/m³, the mass of the displaced water is 100,000 kg, leading to a buoyant force of 980,000 N.

Therefore, the buoyancy of the sphere is 980,000 Newtons.
</think>

**Problem Translation:**

A spherical object with a volume of 200 cubic meters is half-submerged in water and floats. What is the buoyancy of the sphere?

---

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a spherical object with a total volume \( V = 200 \, \text{m}^3 \).
   - It is half-submerged in water, meaning half of its volume is underwater.
   - We need to determine the buoyant force acting on the sphere.

2. **Archimedes' Principle:**
   - The buoyant force \( F_b \) on a floating object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged portion of the object.
   - \( F_b = \rho_{\text{fluid}} \cdot g \cdot V_{\text{submerged}} \)
   - Where:
     - \( \rho_{\text{fluid}} \) is the density of water (\( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)).
     - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
     - \( V_{\text{submerged}} \) is the volume of the sphere that is underwater.

3. **Calculate Submerged Volume:**
   - Since the sphere is half-submerged:
     \[
     V_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{V}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \, \text{m}^3

First, I think I need to find the atomic weights of carbon and hydrogen. I remember that the atomic weight of carbon is approximately 12.01 g/mol, and hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol. These are the standard atomic weights from the periodic table.

So, for one molecule of methane, the molecular weight would be the sum of the atomic weights of its constituent atoms. That means I add the atomic weight of carbon to four times the atomic weight of hydrogen. Let me calculate that: 12.01 + (4 * 1.008). 

Wait, 4 times 1.008 is 4.032, right? Then adding that to 12.01 gives me 16.042 g/mol. Okay, so each mole of methane has a molecular weight of 16.042 grams. 

But the question asks for 12 moles of methane. So, I guess I need to multiply the molecular weight of one mole by 12. That would be 16.042 g/mol multiplied by 12. Let me do that multiplication: 16.042 * 12.

Hmm, 16 times 12 is 192, and 0.042 times 12 is 0.504. Adding those together gives me 192.504 grams. So, the total mass for 12 moles of methane should be 192.504 grams.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I should confirm the atomic weights again. Carbon is about 12.01, hydrogen 1.008. Yeah, that's correct. And the formula for methane is indeed CH4, so one carbon and four hydrogen atoms. 

And molecular weight per mole is the sum, which is 12.01 + (4*1.008) = 16.042 g/mol. Multiplying by 12 moles gives 16.042 * 12 = 192.504 grams. Okay, that seems right.

The molecular weight of methane (CH4) is calculated by summing the atomic weights of one carbon (12.01 g/mol) and four hydrogen atoms (1."

嗯，我现在要解决的问题是，碳单氧化物（CO）的9摩尔的质量是多少克。首先，我得了解碳单氧化物的化学式，也就是CO。这意味着每个CO分子由一个碳原子和一个氧原子组成。

接下来，我需要计算CO的摩尔质量。摩尔质量是指一摩尔物质的质量，以克为单位。为了计算这个值，我需要知道碳和氧的原子量。我记得碳的原子量大约是12.01，而氧的原子量大约是16.00。那么，CO的摩尔质量就是这两个原子量之和，也就是12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01克每摩尔。

现在，我有9摩尔的CO，所以要计算总质量，我需要用摩尔质量乘以摩尔数。计算的话，就是9 mol × 28.01 g/mol。嗯，这个乘法看起来不难，但我要确保自己计算准确。计算一下，9乘以28是252，再加上9乘以0.01得到0.09，所以总和是252.09克。

不过，我想确认一下碳和氧的原子量是否正确。查阅一下周期表，碳确实是约12.01，氧是约16.00，没错。所以，CO的摩尔质量确实是28.01 g/mol。然后乘以9，结果就是252.09克。我觉得这个计算应该是正确的，没有哪里出错吧？

1. **Calculate the molar mass of CO.**
   - Carbon (C) has a molar mass of approximately 12.01 g/mol.
   - Oxygen (O) has a molar mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol.
   - Therefore, the molar mass of CO = 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g/mol.

2. **Determine the mass of 9 moles of CO.**
   - Mass = moles × molar mass.
   - Mass = 9 mol × 28.01 g/mol = 252.09 g.

Answer: 252.09"
