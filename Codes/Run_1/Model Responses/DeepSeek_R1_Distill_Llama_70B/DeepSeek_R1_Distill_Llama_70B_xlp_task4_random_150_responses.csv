To find the smallest non-zero perfect square number divisible by 25, 40, and 60, I first determine the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.

I start by performing the prime factorization of each number:
- 25 is 5 squared.
- 40 is 2 cubed multiplied by 5.
- 60 is 2 squared multiplied by 3 and 5.

Next, I calculate the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations:
- For 2, the highest power is 2^3 from 40.
- For 3, the highest power is 3^1 from 60.
- For 5, the highest power is 5^2 from 25.

Multiplying these together gives an LCM of 8 * 3 * 25, which equals 600.

Finally, to ensure the result is a perfect square, all prime factors in the LCM must have even exponents. Since 600 already satisfies this condition, the smallest non-zero perfect square number divisible by 25, 40, and 60 is 600.

First, I translate the problem from Bengali to English to understand it clearly. It states that the product of two positive numbers is 98, and the larger number is twice the smaller number.

Let's denote the smaller number as x. Therefore, the larger number would be 2x according to the problem.

The equation based on the product is x multiplied by 2x equals 98, which simplifies to 2x² = 98.

To solve for x, I divide both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x² = 49.

Taking the square root of both sides gives x = 7 or x = -7. However, since we're dealing with positive numbers, the smaller number is 7.
</think>

**English Translation:**
The product of two positive numbers is 98, and the larger number is twice the smaller number. The smaller number is ______.

**Solution:**

Let's denote the smaller number as \( x \). According to the problem, the larger number is twice the smaller number, so the larger number is \( 2x \).

Given that their product is 98, we can write the equation:
\[
x \times 2x = 98
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2x^2 = 98
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x^2 = 49
\]

Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{49}
\]
\[
x = 7 \quad (\text{Since } x \text{ is positive})

228,"৪২০ টাকা , ৫৬০ টাকা ও ৬৩০ টাকা  -এর গ.সা.গু _____ টাকা।",৭০,"<think>
First, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers 420, 560, and 630.

I'll start by performing prime factorization on each number.

For 420:
420 divided by 2 is 210.
210 divided by 2 is 105.
105 divided by 3 is 35.
35 divided by 5 is 7.
7 is a prime number.

So, the prime factors of 420 are 2² × 3 × 5 × 7.

For 560:
560 divided by 2 is 280.
280 divided by 2 is 140.
140 divided by 2 is 70.
70 divided by 2 is 35.
35 divided by 5 is 7.
7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factors of 560 are 2⁴ × 5 × 7.

For 630:
630 divided by 2 is 315.
315 divided by 3 is 105.
105 divided by 3 is 35.
35 divided by 5 is 7.
7 is a prime number.

Therefore, the prime factors of 630 are 2 × 3² × 5 × 7.

Now, to find the GCD, I identify the common prime factors with the smallest exponents.

The common prime factors are:
- 2¹ (the smallest power of 2 among the three numbers)
- 3⁰ (since only 420 and 630 have 3, but 560 does not)
- 5¹
- 7¹

Multiplying these together: 2 × 5 × 7 = 70.

Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 420, 560, and 630 is 70.
</think>

**Translation:**  
Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 Taka, 560 Taka, and 630 Taka.

**Solution:**  
To find the GCD of 420, 560, and 630, follow these steps:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - **420:**  
     \( 420 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \)
   - **560:**  
     \( 560 = 2^4 \times 5 \times 7 \)
   - **630:**  
     \( 630 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7 \)

First, I need to understand the problem provided in Bengali. The problem states that a square field has one side measuring 5/2 kilometers and asks for the area of the field.

To find the area of a square when the length of one side is known, I will use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared.

Substituting the given side length into the formula: (5/2 km)² = 25/4 km².

Finally, converting the fractional form to a decimal for clarity, 25/4 equals 6.25. Therefore, the area of the square field is 6.25 square kilometers.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
A square field has one side measuring 5/2 kilometers. What is the area of the field in square kilometers?

**Solution:**
To find the area of a square when the length of one side is known, we use the formula for the area of a square:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side}^2
\]

Given that the length of one side is \( \frac{5}{2} \) kilometers, we substitute this into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4} = 6.25 \text{ km}^2

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the current age of the son. Let me try to understand and break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that 5 years ago, the ratio of the father's age to the son's age was 3:1. So, if I denote the son's age 5 years ago as, let's say, 'x', then the father's age 5 years ago would be 3x because 3:1 is the ratio.

Now, 15 years in the future, the ratio of their ages will be 2:1. That means, at that time, the son's age will be (5 + 15) = 20 years older than his current age, but wait, actually, if the son is currently 'y' years old, then in 15 years, he'll be y + 15. Similarly, the father's current age would be his age 5 years ago plus 5, so 3x + 5, and in 15 years, that would be (3x + 5) + 15 = 3x + 20.

So, setting up the future ratio as 2:1, the father's future age over the son's future age is 2/1. So:

(3x + 20) / (y + 15) = 2/1

But wait, I have two variables here: x and y. I need another equation to solve for both. From the past information, 5 years ago, the son was 'y - 5' years old, and the father was 3x. So:

3x = y - 5

So, this gives me the second equation. Now I can substitute this into the first equation.

From the first equation:

3x + 20 = 2(y + 15)

But since 3x = y - 5, substituting x:

( y - 5 ) + 20 = 2(y + 15)

Simplify:

y + 15 = 2y + 30

Subtract y from both sides:

15 = y + 30

Wait, that gives y = -15, which doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me check. Maybe I mixed up the present ages. Let me redefine.

Let the son's current age be y. So, 5 years ago, he was y -"

First, let's understand the problem. We have a goat that was sold at a 10% loss, and the selling price is given in a way that if it were sold for ₹450 more, it would have resulted in a 5% profit. We need to find the cost price (CP) of the goat.

Let's denote the cost price as CP.

When the goat is sold at a 10% loss, the selling price (SP) is 90% of the CP:
SP = CP - 10% of CP = 0.90 * CP

According to the problem, if the selling price were ₹450 more than this, it would have given a 5% profit. A 5% profit means the selling price would be 105% of the CP:
SP + 450 = 1.05 * CP

Substituting the value of SP from the first equation into the second:
0.90 * CP + 450 = 1.05 * CP

Now, let's solve for CP:
1.05 * CP - 0.90 * CP = 450  
0.15 * CP = 450  
CP = 450 / 0.15  
CP = 3000

So the cost price of the goat is ₹3000.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's denote the cost price (CP) of the goat.

1. **Given:**
   - The goat is sold at a **10% loss**.
   - The selling price (SP) is **₹450** more than this, resulting in a **5% profit**.

2. **Calculations:**
   - **Selling Price at 10% loss:**
     \[
     \text{SP} = \text{CP} - \frac{10}{100} \times \text{CP} = 0.90 \times \text{CP}
     \]
   - **Selling Price for 5% profit:**
     \[
     \text{SP} + 450 = \text{CP} + \frac{5}{100} \times \text{CP} = 1.05 \times \text{CP}
     \]
   - **Equating the two equations:**
     \[
     0.90 \times \text{CP} + 450 = 1.05 \times \text{CP}

Alright, so I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Let me read it again in English to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says there's a square field where each side is 300 meters long. Around this square, on all four sides, there's a road that's 4 meters wide. I need to find the area of this road.

Okay, so first, I need to visualize this. There's a square, and the road surrounds it entirely, being 4 meters wide on each side. That means the road adds an extra space around the square, making the total area including the road larger than the original square.

To find the area of the road, I think I can approach this by calculating the total area including the road and then subtracting the area of the original square. That should give me just the area of the road itself.

So, let's break it down step by step.

First, the original square has sides of 300 meters. The area of a square is side length squared, so that's 300m * 300m, which is 90,000 square meters. I'll write that down:

Area of original square = 300 m * 300 m = 90,000 m².

Now, the road surrounds this square on all four sides and is 4 meters wide. So, when considering the total area including the road, the dimensions would be larger. But how much larger?

Well, the road adds 4 meters on each side. Since there are two sides (left and right, top and bottom), the total addition to each dimension would be double the width of the road. So, for the length and the width, the total becomes:

Original side length + 2*road width.

That would be 300m + 2*4m = 300m + 8m = 308 meters.

So, the total area including the road is 308m * 308m. Let's calculate that.

308 * 308: Let me compute this carefully. 300*300 is 90,000. Then, 300*8 is 2,400, and 8*300 is another 2,400. Finally, 8*8 is 64. Adding those up:

90,000 (from 300*300) + 2,400 + 2,400 (from the two 300*8 terms) = "

First, I need to understand the problem. I'm looking for two consecutive small integers such that the difference between their squares is a perfect square.

Let's denote the smaller integer as \( n \). The next consecutive integer would then be \( n + 1 \).

The squares of these integers are:
\( n^2 \) and \( (n + 1)^2 \).

The difference between their squares is:
\( (n + 1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1 \).

This difference, \( 2n + 1 \), needs to be a perfect square. So, I need to find the smallest \( n \) where \( 2n + 1 \) is a perfect square.

Let's assume \( 2n + 1 = m^2 \), where \( m \) is an integer. Then:
\( n = \frac{m^2 - 1}{2} \).

I need \( n \) to be an integer, so \( m^2 - 1 \) must be even, which means \( m \) has to be odd. Let's test the smallest odd integers for \( m \):

For \( m = 1 \):
\( n = \frac{1 - 1}{2} = 0 \). But we're looking for positive integers.

For \( m = 3 \):
\( n = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4 \).

So, the two consecutive integers are 4 and 5. Let's verify:
\( 4^2 = 16 \) and \( 5^2 = 25 \).
The difference is \( 25 - 16 = 9 \), which is \( 3^2 \), a perfect square.

Therefore, the smallest such pair is 4 and 5, with the smaller number being 4.

First, I note that the person saves 850 Taka each month.

I need to find after how many months the total savings will exceed 50,000 Taka.

I'll set up an inequality where 850 multiplied by the number of months (let's call it 'm') is greater than 50,000.

So, 850m > 50,000.

To solve for 'm', I'll divide both sides by 850, which gives m > 50,000 / 850.

Calculating 50,000 divided by 850, I get approximately 58.82 months.

Since the number of months must be a whole number, I'll round up to the next whole number, which is 59 months.

Therefore, the savings will exceed 50,000 Taka in the 59th month.

**Translated Problem:**
A person saves Tk. 850 every month. However, in the _____ th month, his saved money will exceed Tk. 50,000.

**Solution:**

Let the number of months required to exceed Tk. 50,000 be \( m \).

The monthly savings is Tk. 850. Therefore, the total savings after \( m \) months is:
\[ 850m \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( m \) such that:
\[ 850m > 50,000 \]

Solving for \( m \):
\[ m > \frac{50,000}{850} \]
\[ m > \approx 58.82 \]

Since \( m \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next integer:
\[ m = 59 \]

First, identify the given values in the problem. The divisor (Bhajak) is 78, the quotient (Bhagphal) is 25, and the remainder (Bhagshesh) is one-third of the divisor.

Since the remainder is one-third of 78, calculate the remainder by dividing 78 by 3):
Remainder = 78 / 3 = 26.

Using the division formula, the dividend (Bhajya) is equal to the product of the divisor and the quotient plus the remainder. So:
Bhajya = Divisor × Quotient + Remainder = 78 × 25 + 26.

Calculate 78 multiplied by 25:
78 × 25 = 1950.

Finally, add the remainder to this product:
Bhajya = 1950 + 26 = 1976.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Divisor (Bhājaka)** = 78
- **Quotient (Bhāgphala)** = 25
- **Remainder (Bhāgśeṣa)** = \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the divisor

---

**Step 1: Calculate the Remainder**

The remainder is one-third of the divisor:
\[
\text{Remainder} = \frac{1}{3} \times 78 = 26
\]

---

**Step 2: Use the Division Formula**

The relationship between the dividend (Bhājya), divisor, quotient, and remainder is given by:
\[
\text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\text{Dividend} = (78 \times 25) + 26
\]

---

**Step 3: Perform the Multiplication**

Calculate \(78 \times 25\):
\[
78 \times 25 = 1950
\]

---

**Step 4: Add the Remainder**

Add the remainder to the result:
\[
\text{Dividend} = 1950 + 26 = 1976
\]

---

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1976}
\]

First, I'll determine the total amount of wheat available initially, which is 150 kg.

Next, I'll account for the damaged wheat by subtracting the 30 kg that was lost, leaving me with 120 kg of usable wheat.

I'll calculate the number of students remaining in the hostel by subtracting the 5 students who left from the original 20, resulting in 15 students.

Then, I'll assess the total consumption by considering that each student consumes 0.5 kg of wheat per day (since 15 students consume 7.5 kg daily, which is 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 kg/day).

Finally, I'll divide the remaining 120 kg by the daily consumption of 7.5 kg to determine how many days the wheat will last, which gives me 16 days.
</think>

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Translate the Problem into English
- **Original Bengali Problem (Translated):**
  - ""In a hostel, 20 students have 150 kg of wheat stored for 30 days. However, 30 kg of wheat has been wasted, and 5 students have left home. For how many days will the remaining wheat last the remaining students?""

### Step 2: Solve the Problem

1. **Initial Details:**
   - Total students initially: 20
   - Total wheat available: 150 kg
   - Duration of wheat supply: 30 days
   - Wheat wasted: 30 kg
   - Students left: 5

2. **Adjust the Numbers:**
   - **Usable Wheat:**  
     Total wheat available - wasted wheat = 150 kg - 30 kg = 120 kg
   - **Current Number of Students:**  
     Initial students - students who left = 20 - 5 = 15 students

3. **Calculate Consumption Rate:**
   - The wheat was initially meant for 20 students over 30 days.  
     Total wheat consumption per day for 20 students = 150 kg / 30 days = 5 kg/day

4. **Determine Wheat Consumption per Student:**
   - Wheat consumption per student per day = Total daily consumption / Number of students  
     = 5 kg/day ÷ 20 students = 0.25 kg/student/day

5. **Calculate the Duration the Remaining Wheat Will Last:**

First, I need to determine the current ages of both the Banyan and Pine trees.

I know that 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. Since the Pine tree is currently 1432 years old, I can find its age 150 years ago by subtracting 150 from 1432, which gives me 1282 years.

Next, I'll subtract the Pine tree's age 150 years ago from the total sum at that time to find the Banyan tree's age 150 years ago. So, 2961 minus 1282 equals 1679 years.

Now, to find the Banyan tree's current age, I'll add 150 years to its age 150 years ago, resulting in 1679 plus 150, which is 1829 years.

Finally, to determine the current total age of both trees, I'll add the current ages of the Banyan and Pine trees together. That is, 1829 plus 1432 equals 3261 years.

**Solution:**

1. **Given:**
   - 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the banyan tree (B) and the pine tree (P) was:
     \[
     B_{150} + P_{150} = 2961 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Current age of the pine tree:

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem is: ""What is the smallest number that, when added to 5320, results in a perfect square?""

First, I need to understand what a perfect square is. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 25 is a perfect square because it's 5 squared (5²), and 100 is 10 squared (10²).

So, our goal is to find the smallest integer x such that 5320 + x = n², where n is some integer. To find x, I need to determine the smallest n where n² is greater than 5320.

First, let's find the square root of 5320 to get an idea of where we're starting. Calculating the square root:

√5320 ≈ 72.93

This means that 72² = 5184 and 73² = 5329.

Well, 73 squared is 5329, which is just 9 more than 5320. So, if we add 9 to 5320, we get 5329, which is a perfect square.

Therefore, the smallest number to add is 9.

So, 5320 + 9 = 5329 = 73², which is a perfect square.
</think>

To find the smallest number that, when added to 5320, results in a perfect square, we start by identifying the nearest perfect square greater than 5320. 

1. Calculate the square root of 5320:  
   \( \sqrt{5320} \approx 72.93 \).  
   The next integer is 73, so we compute \( 73^2 \):  
   \( 73^2 = 5329 \).

2. Determine the difference between this perfect square and 5320:  
   \( 5329 - 5320 = 9 \).

Thus, the smallest number to add to 5320 to make it a perfect square is 9.

I need to solve the problem where I have to find the difference between simple interest and compound interest on a principal amount of ৫০০০ টাকা (which is 5000 Taka) at an annual interest rate of ১০% (10%) over 3 years. 

First, I'll calculate the simple interest using the formula: 

Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T)

Plugging in the values: 

SI = 5000 × 10% × 3 = 1500 Taka.

Next, I'll calculate the compound interest. Since it's compounded annually, I'll use the formula:

Amount (A) = P × (1 + R/100)^T

So,

A = 5000 × (1 + 10/100)^3 = 5000 × (1.1)^3 = 5000 × 1.331 = 6655 Taka.

Now, the compound interest (CI) is the amount minus the principal:

CI = 6655 - 5000 = 1655 Taka.

Finally, the difference between compound interest and simple interest is:

CI - SI = 1655 - 1500 = 155 Taka.

First, let's denote the distance between Kamalapur and Narayanganj stations as \( x \) km.

When the train travels at 30 km/h, the time taken to cover the distance is \( \frac{x}{30} \) hours.

If the speed decreases to 25 km/h, the time taken increases by 10 minutes. Since time is in hours, 10 minutes is \( \frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6} \) hours. Therefore, the time taken at 25 km/h is \( \frac{x}{25} \) hours.

The relationship between the two speeds can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{25} - \frac{x}{30} = \frac{1}{6} \]

Finding a common denominator for the left side:
\[ \frac{6x - 5x}{150} = \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ \frac{x}{150} = \frac{1}{6} \]

Multiplying both sides by 150:
\[ x = 150 \times \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the distance between the two stations is 25 km.

First, I'll define the variables for the costs. Let the price of each notebook be N and the price of each pencil be P.

From the first boy's purchase, buying 15 notebooks and 10 pencils costing 300 Taka, I can set up the equation: 15N + 10P = 300.

Similarly, the second boy buys 10 notebooks and 15 pencils for 250 Taka, leading to the second equation: 10N + 15P = 250.

To solve these simultaneous equations, I'll use the elimination method. First, I'll multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of the pencils.

After multiplying, the equations become:
- 45N + 30P = 900
- 20N + 30P = 500

Subtracting the second new equation from the first eliminates the pencils:
25N = 400

Solving for N gives N = 16 Taka per notebook.

Substituting N back into the original first equation to find P:
15(16) + 10P = 300 → 240 + 10P = 300 → 10P = 60 → P = 6 Taka per pencil.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Define Variables**

Let:
- The price of each notebook be \( N \) Taka.
- The price of each pencil be \( P \) Taka.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**

From the problem:

1. First boy:
   \[
   15N + 10P = 300 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]
2. Second boy:
   \[
   10N + 15P = 250 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**

Multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 2 to align the coefficients of \( P \):

\[
\begin{align*}
3 \times \text{Equation 1}: & \quad 45N + 30P = 900 \quad \text{(Equation 3)} \\
2 \times \text{Equation 2}: & \quad 20N + 30P = 500 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}

First, let's understand the problem. The total cost to carpet the floor of a room is 7200 Taka. If the width of the room were 3 meters less, the cost would be 576 Taka less. We need to find the original width of the room.

Let's define the variables:
- Let w be the original width of the room in meters.
- Let l be the length of the room in meters.

The area of the room, which determines the amount of carpet needed, is given by the product of its length and width: A = l * w.

The initial cost is 7200 Taka, so the cost per square meter of carpet is 7200 divided by the area:
Cost per square meter = 7200 / (l * w)

If the width decreases by 3 meters, the new width becomes (w - 3), and the new cost becomes (7200 - 576) = 6624 Taka. The cost per square meter remains the same, so:
6624 / (l * (w - 3)) = 7200 / (l * w)

We can simplify this equation by canceling out the length l:
6624 / (w - 3) = 7200 / w

Cross-multiplying gives:
6624w = 7200(w - 3)

Expanding the right side:
6624w = 7200w - 21600

Rearranging the equation:
7200w - 6624w = 21600
576w = 21600

Finally, solving for w:
w = 21600 / 576
w = 37.5 meters

The original width of the room is 37.5 meters.
</think>

**Translation:**  
To cover the floor of a room with carpet, the total cost is 7200 Taka. If the width of the room were 3 meters less, the cost would be 576 Taka less. What is the width of the room?

**Solution:**  
Let's denote:
- \( w \) = original width (in meters)
- \( l \) = length of the room (in meters)

The area of the room is \( A = w \times l \).

The initial cost is 7200 Taka, so the cost per square meter is:
\[
\text{Cost per square meter} = \frac{7200}{w \times l}

 aioooks like I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

Okay, the problem is in Bengali, and I need to translate it into English first. So, it says: ""দুই অঙ্কবিশিষ্ট কোনো সংখ্যার অঙ্কদ্বয়ের যোগফল ১০ এবং বিয়োগফল ৪ হলে, এই রকম সম্ভাব্য বৃহত্তম সংখ্যাটি _____ হবে।""

Translating this into English, it becomes: ""Of any two-digit number whose digits sum to 10 and difference is 4, what is the largest possible such number?""

Alright, so I need to find the largest two-digit number where the sum of its digits is 10, and the difference between the digits is 4.

Let me break this down. Let's denote the tens digit as 'a' and the units digit as 'b'. Then, according to the problem:

a + b = 10
a - b = 4

I can solve these two equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

First, let's add the two equations:

(a + b) + (a - b) = 10 + 4
2a = 14
So, a = 7

Now, substitute a = 7 into the first equation:

7 + b = 10
b = 3

So the digits are 7 and 3. The number is 73.

Wait, but the problem asks for the largest possible such number. But 73 seems to be the only solution. Am I missing something?

Hmm, perhaps I should consider alternative interpretations. For instance, does the difference mean the absolute difference? Let's check.

If the difference is |a - b| = 4, then besides a - b = 4, there's also the possibility of b - a = 4.

So, let's consider two cases:

I need to determine the rate of interest that yields the given amounts when compounded annually. 

Given that the principal (P) after 3 years is 1,578 and after 5 years is 1,830, I can set up the compound interest formula for both scenarios.

First, using the 3-year data:
P after 3 years = P * (1 + r)^3 = 1,578.

Next, using the 5-year data:
P after 5 years = P * (1 + r)^5 = 1,830.

Dividing the two equations should eliminate the principal (P) and allow me to solve for the interest rate (r).
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**

What is the rate percentage if the compound interest on a principal for 3 years is 1,578 and for 5 years is 1,830? Determine the rate percentage.

**Solution:**

Let's denote:
- **P** = Principal amount
- **r** = Rate of interest (in decimal form)
- **A₃** = Amount after 3 years = P(1 + r)³ = 1,578
- **A₅** = Amount after 5 years = P(1 + r)⁵ = 1,830

To find **r**, we can divide the two equations to eliminate **P**:

\[
\frac{A_5}{A_3} = \frac{P(1 + r)^5}{P(1 + r)^3} = (1 + r)^{5-3} = (1 + r)^2
\]

\[
(1 + r)^2 = \frac{1,830}{1,578} = \frac{610}{526} \approx 1.16
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
1 + r = \sqrt{1.16} \approx 1.077
\]

Subtracting 1:

\[
r \approx 0.077 \text{ or } 7.7\%

Alright, let me try to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the area of a parallelogram. I remember that the area of a parallelogram is calculated by base multiplied by height. Let me make sure I got that right.

Okay, the problem says the base is 40 meters and the height is 50 meters. So, I need to multiply these two numbers together. Let me do the math: 40 times 50. Hmm, 40 times 50 is... well, 4 times 5 is 20, and since both are multiplied by 10, it should be 2000. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, let me double-check. If I have a base of 40 and height of 50, multiplying them gives the area. I don't think I need to do anything else because parallelogram area is straightforward with base and height. So, 40 times 50 is indeed 2000 square meters.

I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any other steps needed here. It's a simple multiplication problem once you know the formula.

First, set up the variables for the number of adult tickets (A) and child tickets (C). 

We know from the problem that 80 tickets were sold in total, which gives us the first equation: A + C = 80. 

The total revenue from ticket sales was 540 taka. Since adult tickets are 7.50 taka each and child tickets are 4.50 taka each, the total revenue equation is 7.50A + 4.50C = 540. 

To make the calculations simpler, multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the decimals: 15A + 9C = 1080. 

Now, solve the first equation for C: C = 80 - A, and substitute this into the modified second equation: 15A + 9(80 - A) = 1080. 

Simplify and solve for A: 
15A + 720 - 9A = 1080 
6A + 720 = 1080 
6A = 360 
A = 60. 

Therefore, 60 adult tickets were sold.
</think>

### Solution:

Let's denote:
- \( A \) = Number of adult tickets sold
- \( C \) = Number of child tickets sold

We have the following system of equations based on the problem:

1. Total number of tickets sold:
   \[
   A + C = 80
   \]
   
2. Total revenue from tickets:
   \[
   7.50A + 4.50C = 540
   \]

**Step 1:** Solve for \( C \) from the first equation:
\[
C = 80 - A
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( C \) into the second equation:
\[
7.50A + 4.50(80 - A) = 540
\]
\[
7.50A + 360 - 4.50A = 540
\]
\[
3A + 360 = 540
\]
\[
3A = 180
\]
\[
A = 60

Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln are three brothers, and their father divided 6300 taka among them. The problem says that Sabuj got 3/5 of Dalim's share, and Dalim got twice as much as Lincoln. I need to find out how much money Sabuj got.

Let me break this down. There are three people: Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln. Their shares are related in some way. The total amount is 6300 taka.

First, I need to define variables for each person's share. Let me think, maybe I can let Lincoln's share be something, say, L. Then, since Dalim got twice as much as Lincoln, Dalim's share would be 2L. And Sabuj got 3/5 of Dalim's share, so Sabuj would have (3/5)*2L, which is (6/5)L or 1.2L.

Wait, let me make sure. So if Lincoln is L, Dalim is 2L, and Sabuj is (3/5) of Dalim. So that's (3/5)*2L, which simplifies to (6/5)L. Yeah, that's correct.

So now, the total is Sabuj + Dalim + Lincoln = 6300 taka.

In terms of L, that would be 6/5 L + 2L + L = 6300.

Wait, let me calculate the sum. 6/5 L is the same as 1.2L. So 1.2L + 2L + 1L is equal to 4.2L.

So 4.2L = 6300.

To find L, I can divide 6300 by 4.2.

Let me compute that. 6300 divided by 4.2. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. 4.2 is the same as 42/10 or 21/5. So dividing by 21/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/21.

So 6300 * (5/21) = (6300 * 5) / 21.

Let me compute 6300 divided by 21 first. 21 times 300 is 6300. So 6300 divided by 21 is 300. Then, 300 multiplied by 5 is 1500."

First, I need to determine the depth of the water in the pool.

The pool has a volume of 8000 liters. To convert liters to cubic meters, I use the conversion factor where 1 m³ equals 1000 liters. So, 8000 liters is equal to 8 cubic meters.

Given the length (L) is 2.56 meters and the width (W) is 1.25 meters, I can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is V = L * W * H, where H is the depth.

Plugging in the known values, I have 8 = 2.56 * 1.25 * H.

Calculating the product of 2.56 and 1.25 gives me approximately 3.2.

Finally, to find H, I divide both sides by 3.2, which gives H = 8 / 3.2 = 2.5 meters.

So, the depth of the water in the pool is 2.5 meters.
</think>

To find the depth of the water in the pool, follow these steps:

1. **Convert Volume from Liters to Cubic Meters**:  
   Since \(1 \, \text{m}^3 = 1000 \, \text{liters}\),  
   \(8000 \, \text{liters} = \frac{8000}{1000} = 8 \, \text{m}^3\).

2. **Use the Formula for Volume of a Rectangular Prism**:  
   The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by:  
   \[
   V = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
   \]

3. **Plug in the Known Values**:  
   \[
   8 = 2.56 \times 1.25 \times \text{Depth}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Product of Length and Width**:  
   \[
   2.56 \times 1.25 = 3.2
   \]

5. **Solve for Depth**:  
   \[
   \text{Depth} = \frac{8}{3.2} = 2.5 \, \text{meters}

First, I identify the total cost and the number of plates and cups. The total cost is 3920 Taka for 12 plates and 20 cups. A cup costs 145 Taka.

I subtract the total cost of the cups from the overall total to find the total cost of the plates. So, I multiply 20 cups by 145 Taka per cup, which equals 2900 Taka.

Next, I subtract this from the total cost: 3920 Taka minus 2900 Taka leaves 1020 Taka for the plates.

Finally, I divide 1020 Taka by 12 plates to find the cost per plate, which is 85 Taka.
</think>

**Translation:**  
The cost of 12 plates and 20 cups together is 3920 Taka. The cost of one cup is 145 Taka. The cost of one plate is ______ Taka.

**Solution:**  
Let the cost of one plate be \( P \) Taka and the cost of one cup be \( C \) Taka.

Given:
\[
12P + 20C = 3920
\]
\[
C = 145

First, let's denote the total work as 1 complete task.

Since Habiba and Halima together can complete the work in 20 days, their combined work rate is \( \frac{1}{20} \) task per day.

They worked together for 8 days, so the work done in these 8 days is:
\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{8}{20} = \frac{2}{5} \]

This means the remaining work is:
\[ 1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \]

Halima completes the remaining \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the task in 21 days. Therefore, her work rate is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \div 21 = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{21} = \frac{1}{35} \] task per day.

Now, to find out how long Halima alone would take to complete the entire task, we take the reciprocal of her work rate:
\[ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{35}} = 35 \text{ days} \]

First, I need to determine the volume of the cube. The cube has an edge length of 50 cm, so its volume is calculated by multiplying the edge length by itself three times.

Next, I'll calculate the volume of water displaced by the cube when it's submerged in the tank. Since the cube is completely underwater, the volume of displaced water equals the volume of the cube.

After removing the cube from the tank, the water level will decrease. To find the new water depth, I'll subtract the displaced volume from the initial volume of water in the tank and then divide by the base area of the tank to find the change in depth.

Finally, I'll determine the new water depth by subtracting the change in depth from the initial water level, which was 1 meter.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the volume of the metal cube:**
   
   The edge length of the cube is 50 cm, which is \(0.5\) meters.

   \[
   \text{Volume of cube} = \text{edge length}^3 = (0.5 \, \text{m})^3 = 0.125 \, \text{m}^3

Let’s denote the tens digit as \( T \) and the units digit as \( U \). The two-digit number can be expressed as \( 10T + U \).

According to the first condition:
The sum of the digits plus 7 is equal to three times the tens digit.
\[
(T + U) + 7 = 3T
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
U + 7 = 2T \quad (1)
\]

From the second condition:
Subtracting 18 from the number results in swapping its digits.
\[
(10T + U) - 18 = 10U + T
\]
Simplifying:
\[
10T + U - 18 = 10U + T
\]
\[
9T - 9U = 18
\]
Dividing both sides by 9:
\[
T - U = 2 \quad (2)
\]

Now, we solve equations (1) and (2) simultaneously.
From equation (2):
\[
T = U + 2
\]
Substituting into equation (1):
\[
U + 7 = 2(U + 2)
\]
\[
U + 7 = 2U + 4
\]
\[
U = 3
\]
Then, \( T = 3 + 2 = 5 \).

So, the number is:
\[
10T + U = 10 \times 5 + 3 = 53
\]

Verification:
1. Sum of digits + 7:
   \[
   (5 + 3) + 7 = 15
   \]
   Three times the tens digit:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   Condition satisfied.

2. Subtract 18:
   \[
   53 - 18 = 35

To find the smallest natural number \( x \) such that \( 162 \times x \) results in a perfect square, I start by examining the prime factorization of 162.

First, I break down 162 into its prime factors:
\[
162 = 2 \times 81 = 2 \times 9 \times 9 = 2 \times 3^4
\]

For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. The current factorization of 162 has:
- The exponent of 2 as 1, which is odd.
- The exponent of 3 as 4, which is even.

To make all exponents even, I need to multiply by 2 to make the exponent of 2 even. Therefore, the smallest such \( x \) is 2.

Multiplying 162 by 2 gives:
\[
162 \times 2 = 324
\]
and
\[
\sqrt{324} = 18
\]
which confirms that 324 is indeed a perfect square.

Thus, the smallest natural number \( x \) that satisfies the condition is 2.
</think>

# Solution:

To find the smallest natural number \( x \) such that \( 162 \times x \) is a perfect square, follow these steps:

1. **Prime Factorization of 162**:
   \[
   162 = 2 \times 81 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 3^2 = 2 \times 3^4
   \]
   
2. **Condition for a Perfect Square**:
   A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. Currently, the prime factorization of \( 162 \times x \) is:
   \[
   2^1 \times 3^4 \times x
   \]
   
3. **Determining the Smallest \( x \)**:
   - The exponent of 2 is 1 (odd). To make it even, \( x \) must include another factor of 2.
   - The exponent of 3 is 4 (even). No additional factors of 3 are needed.
   
   Therefore:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]
   
4. **Verification**:
   \[
   162 \times 2 = 324 = 18^2

First, calculate the circumference of the circular garden using the formula 2 * π * r, where the radius r is 21 meters. Multiplying 2 by π (approximately 3.1416) and then by 21 gives a circumference of approximately 131.946 meters.

Since the gardener wants to loop the rope around the garden twice, multiply the circumference by 2 to get the total length of rope required. This results in about 263.892 meters.

Finally, to find the total cost of the rope, multiply the total length by the cost per meter, which is 18 Tk. Therefore, 263.892 meters multiplied by 18 Tk/m equals approximately 4748.016 Tk.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the gardener needs to spend 4748 Tk on the rope.

First, let's understand the given data.

We know that it takes 1/3 deciliters of paint to paint 3/5 square meters of wall. So, to find out how much wall can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint, we can set up a proportion.

If 1/3 deciliters paints 3/5 square meters, then 1 deciliter will paint x square meters.

So, (1/3) deciliters --> 3/5 square meters

Thus, 1 deciliter --> x = (3/5) * 3 = 9/5 square meters

Therefore, 1 deciliter of paint can cover 9/5 square meters of wall, which is 1.8 square meters.
</think>

**Problem in English:**
3/5 square meters of wall requires 1/3 deciliters of paint. How many square meters of wall can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint?

**Solution:**

We need to determine the area that can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint.

1. First, find out how much paint is needed per square meter:
   
   Paint required for 3/5 square meters = 1/3 deciliters

2. Therefore, paint required for 1 square meter:
   
   \( \frac{1}{3} \text{ dcl} \div \frac{3}{5} \text{ m}^2 = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{5}{9} \text{ dcl/m}^2 \)

3. Now, calculate the area that can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint:
   
   Area = \( 1 \text{ dcl} \div \frac{5}{9} \text{ dcl/m}^2 = \frac{9}{5} \text{ m}^2 = 1.8 \text{ m}^2 \)

First, I will assign variables to represent Farida's and Fatema's salaries. Let \( F \) represent Farida's salary and \( Fat \) represent Fatema's salary.

From the problem, the total of their salaries is 19,950 takas. This gives the equation:
\[ F + Fat = 19,950 \]

It is also stated that Fatema earns 2,450 takas more than Farida. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ Fat = F + 2,450 \]

Now, I will substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( F \):
\[ F + (F + 2,450) = 19,950 \]
\[ 2F + 2,450 = 19,950 \]
\[ 2F = 19,950 - 2,450 \]
\[ 2F = 17,500 \]
\[ F = 8,750 \]

Therefore, Farida's salary is 8,750 takas.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) = Farida's salary (in Takas)
   - Let \( Fat \) = Fatema's salary (in Takas)

2. **Translate the Information into Equations:**
   - The sum of their salaries is \( 19,950 \) Takas:
     \[
     F + Fat = 19,950
     \]
   - Fatema earns \( 2,450 \) Takas more than Farida:
     \[
     Fat = F + 2,450
     \]

3. **Substitute the Second Equation into the First:**
   \[
   F + (F + 2,450) = 19,950
   \]
   \[
   2F + 2,450 = 19,950
   \]

4. **Solve for \( F \):**
   \[
   2F = 19,950 - 2,450 = 17,500
   \]
   \[
   F = \frac{17,500}{2} = 8,750
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Farida's salary is \( 8,750 \) Takas.

First, let's understand the problem. We have two positive numbers whose product is 147, and the larger number is three times the smaller number.

Let’s denote the smaller number as x.

Then, the larger number would be 3x.

According to the problem, the product of these two numbers is 147. So we can write the equation:

x * 3x = 147

This simplifies to:

3x² = 147

To solve for x, we'll divide both sides by 3:

x² = 49

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

x = 7

Since x represents the smaller number, the larger number is 3 times x:

Larger number = 3 * 7 = 21

Therefore, the larger number is 21.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
Two positive numbers have a product of 147. The larger number is three times the smaller number. What is the larger number?

**Solution:**

Let's denote:
- \( x \) = the smaller number
- \( 3x \) = the larger number (since it is three times the smaller number)

According to the problem, the product of these two numbers is 147. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x \times 3x = 147
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
3x^2 = 147
\]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3:

\[
x^2 = \frac{147}{3} = 49
\]

Take the square root of both sides:

\[
x = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Since \( x = 7 \) is the smaller number, the larger number is:

\[
3x = 3 \times 7 = 21

First, I need to determine the initial number of animals in Tanvir's farm. There are 50 buffalo and 60 cows, making a total of 110 animals.

Next, I calculate the number of new calves born each year. Each cow gives birth to 2 calves annually, so with 60 cows, that's 60 multiplied by 2, resulting in 120 new calves.

However, 30% of these calves die due to disease. To find the number of surviving calves, I subtract the 30% loss from the total. This means 70% of the calves survive, which is 0.7 times 120, equaling 84 surviving calves.

Now, I add the surviving calves to the original number of animals. The initial count was 110 animals, and adding the 84 new calves gives a total of 194 animals after one year.

First, I need to identify the given dimensions of the box. The length is 15 centimeters and 2.4 millimeters, the width is 7 centimeters and 6.2 millimeters, and the height is 5 centimeters and 8 millimeters.

Next, I'll convert all measurements to millimeters to ensure uniformity. 

Calculating the length:
15 cm = 150 mm
Adding the millimeters: 150 mm + 2.4 mm = 152.4 mm

Calculating the width:
7 cm = 70 mm
Adding the millimeters: 70 mm + 6.2 mm = 76.2 mm

Calculating the height:
5 cm = 50 mm
Adding the millimeters: 50 mm + 8 mm = 58 mm

Now, I'll convert these measurements back to centimeters for consistency in volume calculation:
Length: 152.4 mm = 15.24 cm
Width: 76.2 mm = 7.62 cm
Height: 58 mm = 5.8 cm

Finally, I'll calculate the volume using the formula: volume = length × width × height.

Volume = 15.24 cm × 7.62 cm × 5.8 cm = 694.5 cm³
</think>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Convert all dimensions to centimeters:**
   - Length: \(15 \, \text{cm} + 2.4 \, \text{mm} = 15.24 \, \text{cm}\)
   - Width: \(7 \, \text{cm} + 6.2 \, \text{mm} = 7.62 \, \text{cm}\)
   - Height: \(5 \, \text{cm} + 8 \, \text{mm} = 5.8 \, \text{cm}\)

2. **Calculate the volume using the formula:**
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 15.24 \, \text{cm} \times 7.62 \, \text{cm} \times 5.8 \, \text{cm}

Alright, so I've been given this math problem, and I need to figure out how much money Lincoln got. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln are three brothers. Their father divided 6,300 rupees among them. It mentions two specific ratios: Sabuj gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, and Dalim gets twice what Lincoln gets. My goal is to find out how much Lincoln received.

Okay, let's list what we know:

- Total amount = 6,300 rupees
- Sabuj's share = (3/5) * Dalim's share
- Dalim's share = 2 * Lincoln's share

I need to find Lincoln's share, so maybe I can express everything in terms of Lincoln's share.

Let me denote Lincoln's share as L.

From the problem, Dalim's share is twice Lincoln's, so Dalim gets 2L.

Sabuj's share is 3/5 of Dalim's. Since Dalim gets 2L, Sabuj gets (3/5)*(2L) = (6/5)L.

So now, the total amount is the sum of all their shares:

Sabuj + Dalim + Lincoln = 6,300

Plugging in the expressions in terms of L:

(6/5)L + 2L + L = 6,300

Let me add them up. Let's convert everything to fifths to make it easier.

(6/5)L + (10/5)L + (5/5)L = (6 + 10 + 5)/5 L = 21/5 L

So, 21/5 L = 6,300

To solve for L, I'll multiply both sides by 5/21:

L = 6,300 * (5/21)

Let me compute that:

First, 6,300 divided by 21: 21*300=6,300, so 6,300 ÷21 = 300.

Then, 300 *5 = 1,500.

So L = 1,500 rupees.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.

Dalim gets 2*L = 3,000 rupees.

Sabuj gets (3/5) of Dalim's share, which is (3/5)*3,000 = 1,800 rupees.

First, identify the given information. The problem states that a 1-meter metal pipe weighs 13/8 kilograms.

Next, determine the required length of the pipe, which is 3/5 meters.

Since the pipe's weight is directly proportional to its length, set up a proportion to find the weight of the 3/5-meter pipe. 

So, proportion = (3/5) / 1 = 3/5.

Multiply the weight per meter by this proportion: (13/8) kg/m * 3/5 = (13 * 3) / (8 * 5) = 39/40 kilograms.

Therefore, the weight of the 3/5-meter pipe is 39/40 kg.
</think>

**Translated Problem:**
A metal pipe of 1 meter weighs \( \frac{13}{8} \) kg. What is the weight of \( \frac{3}{5} \) meters of the pipe?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a metal pipe.
   - 1 meter of this pipe weighs \( \frac{13}{8} \) kg.
   - We need to find the weight of \( \frac{3}{5} \) meters of the same pipe.

2. **Set Up the Proportion:**
   - Since the weight is directly proportional to the length, we can set up the following proportion:
     \[
     \text{Weight of } \frac{3}{5} \text{ meters} = \left( \frac{13}{8} \, \text{kg} \right) \times \left( \frac{3}{5} \, \text{m} \right)
     \]

3. **Calculate the Weight:**
   - Multiply the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{13}{8} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{13 \times 3}{8 \times 5} = \frac{39}{40} \, \text{kg}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The weight of \( \frac{3}{5} \) meters of the pipe is \( \frac{39}{40} \) kg.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 7, gives a perfect square. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as some integer multiplied by itself. So, examples are 1 (1x1), 4 (2x2), 9 (3x3), and so on. So, the task here is to find the smallest number 'x' such that 7 multiplied by x is one of these perfect squares.

Let me think about the prime factors. 7 is a prime number, right? So, when I multiply it by another number x, I want the product to have even exponents in its prime factorization because that's what makes a number a perfect square.

Let's say x is the number we're looking for. So, 7 * x should be a perfect square. If I factorize x into primes, suppose x = 7^a * other primes. Then, the product 7*x would have 7^(a+1) multiplied by other primes. For this to be a perfect square, each prime's exponent must be even.

So, the exponent of 7 in 7*x is (a+1). To make this even, (a+1) needs to be even, which means a must be odd. The smallest odd number is 1. So, the smallest x would have a factor of 7^1. Now, do we have any other primes in x? Well, if x had any other primes besides 7, their exponents would also need to be even, but since we want the smallest x, we shouldn't include any other primes because adding more factors would make x larger.

Wait, but if x is just 7, then 7*7 is 49, which is 7^2. Oh, wait, that's a perfect square! So, does that mean the smallest x is 7?

Wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check. If x is 7, then 7*7=49, which is indeed a perfect square. So, x=7 is the smallest such number. I think that makes sense because 7 itself only needs one more 7 to make it a square. There's no smaller number than 7 that when multiplied by 7 would"

First, I recognize that the total number of saplings is 1800, and there are 36 extra trees after arranging them in a square.

Since it's a square arrangement, the number of trees per side (n) is such that n squared is 36 more than 1800.

So, I set up the equation n² = 1800 + 36, which simplifies to n² = 1836.

Taking the square root of both sides, I find that n is approximately 42.84. However, the number of trees per side must be a whole number.

Therefore, I consider rounding down to 42 trees per side, which results in a total number of trees arranged as 42² = 1764, leaving 36 trees remaining as mentioned in the problem.

Thus, each row contains 42 saplings.

**Translation:**  
In a garden, there are 1800 saplings to be planted in a square arrangement. If 36 saplings are left after planting in a square arrangement, then how many saplings are planted in each row?

---

**Solution:**

1. **Total number of saplings = 1800**
2. **Extra saplings after square arrangement = 36**
3. **Let the number of saplings per row be \( n \).**
4. **Total saplings planted in square arrangement = \( n^2 \)**
5. **Total saplings available for planting = \( n^2 + 36 \)**
6. **Therefore, \( n^2 + 36 = 1800 \)**  
   \( n^2 = 1800 - 36 \)  
   \( n^2 = 1764 \)
7. **Taking the square root on both sides:**  
   \( n = \sqrt{1764} \)  
   \( n = 42 \)

A portion of the bank of the Ichhamati River takes 40 workers 35 days to construct. How many workers will be needed to complete the same portion in 28 days?

**Solution:**  
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of man-days, which is a unit of work representing one person working for one day. The total amount of work can be calculated as follows:

Total man-days = Number of workers × Number of days = 40 workers × 35 days = 1400 man-days

We need to find the number of workers (let's call it `x`) required to complete 1400 man-days of work in 28 days:

\( x \times 28 = 1400 \)

Solving for `x`:

\( x = \frac{1400}{28} \)  
\( x = 50 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Therefore, **50 workers** are needed to complete the construction in 28 days.

First, I need to calculate the volume of the gold bar. The bar is rectangular, so its volume is length × width × height. Converting the dimensions from centimeters to meters, the volume in cubic meters is 0.078 m × 0.064 m × 0.025 m, which equals 0.000124 cubic meters.

Next, I know the density of gold is 19.3 times the density of water. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³, so the density of gold is 19.3 × 1000 = 19300 kg/m³.

Now, to find the mass of the gold bar, I multiply the volume by the density of gold: 0.000124 m³ × 19300 kg/m³ = 2.3932 kg.

Finally, converting kilograms to grams, I multiply by 1000, resulting in 2393.2 grams. Rounding this to one decimal place gives 2393.2 grams.

To determine the weight of the gold bar, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - **Relative density of gold to water:** 19.3
   - **Dimensions of the gold bar:**
     - Length = 7.8 cm = 0.078 m
     - Width = 6.4 cm = 0.064 m
     - Height = 2.5 cm = 0.025 m

2. **Calculate the volume of the gold bar:**
   
   \[

3. **Find the mass of the water displaced by this volume:**
   
   - Density of water = 1000 kg/m³
   
   \[
   \text{Mass of water} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 1000\, \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3} \times 0.000124\, \text{m}^3 = 0.124\, \text{kg}

Problem: In a running competition, one lap around the track is equal to 800 meters. He will cross the 10,000-meter mark on his ____th lap.

Okay, so I need to figure out on which lap a runner completes 10,000 meters if each lap is 800 meters. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here. Essentially, I need to determine how many times the runner needs to complete the 800-meter lap to reach or exceed 10,000 meters total.

First, I'll think about how laps and distance are related. Each lap is 800 meters, so with each lap completed, the runner adds 800 meters to their total distance. To find out when they hit 10,000 meters, I need to calculate how many full laps make up at least 10,000 meters.

Mathematically, this seems like a division problem. If I divide the total distance by the distance per lap, I'll get the number of laps needed. So, 10,000 meters divided by 800 meters per lap.

Let me do that calculation: 10,000 divided by 800. Hmm, 800 goes into 10,000 how many times? Well, 800 multiplied by 12 is 9,600, which is less than 10,000. Then 800 multiplied by 12.5 is 10,000 exactly because 800 times 12 is 9,600, and 800 times 0.5 is 400, so 9,600 plus 400 equals 10,000. So, 800 times 12.5 equals 10,000. That would mean that after 12.5 laps, the runner reaches exactly 10,000 meters.

However, in races, runners complete full laps, so completing 12 laps would only be 9,600 meters, which is less than 10,000. So, the 13th lap would be when the runner surpasses the 10,000-meter mark. But wait, I thought the calculation showed that 12.5 laps equal exactly 10,000. Maybe in terms of the race, they count half laps as well, but typically, laps are whole numbers.

Wait a minute, I might have a confusion here. If 12.5 laps make exactly 10,000 meters, then during the 13th lap, the runner would reach 10,000 meters at the halfway point of that lap. So, technically,"

First, I need to identify the given values for the cylinder:
- The radius (r) is 5.5 cm.
- The height (h) is 8 cm.
- The value of π is given as 3.14.

The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is 2πr(r + h). Plugging in the given values:
2 * 3.14 * 5.5 * (5.5 + 8).

I calculate the sum inside the parentheses first: 5.5 + 8 equals 13.5.

Then, I multiply 2 by 3.14, which gives 6.28.

Next, I multiply 6.28 by 5.5, resulting in 34.54.

Finally, I multiply 34.54 by 13.5 to find the total surface area.

Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'll try to break it down step by step. First, let me understand what's being asked here.

The problem is about a businessman who sells two different items: rice and salt. He sells a certain amount of rice and a certain amount of salt in a day, and we need to figure out how much salt he sells in a month based on his daily sales.

Let me start by translating the problem into English to make sure I understand it correctly:

""A businessman sells 18 kg 300 grams of rice and 5 kg 750 grams of salt in one day. According to this, how many kg of salt does he sell in a month?""

Wait, that seems a bit off. So he sells both rice and salt on the same day. But the question is specifically about the salt sold in a month. So, the rice sales might not be directly relevant unless there's a connection between the rice and salt sales that I'm missing. Perhaps they're trying to imply that the ratio of rice to salt sold daily is significant, and from that, I can infer the monthly salt sales. But the problem doesn't mention anything about monthly rice sales, so I think the rice part might just be extra information, and the key is just the daily salt sales.

So, if he sells 5 kg 750 grams of salt every day, I need to find out how much he sells in a month. But the problem is, in the original statement, it's written as ""5 কে.জি. ৭৫০ গ্রাম,"" which is a bit confusing because 5 kg 750 grams is more than 5 kg, as 750 grams is three-fourths of a kilogram, so altogether that's 5.75 kg.

But wait, now I'm getting confused because the problem states he sells ""5 কে.জি. ৭৫০ গ্রাম,"" which could be misinterpreted. In Bengali, when they say ""5 কে.জি. ৭৫০ গ্রাম,"" it's combining kilograms and grams, so that would actually be 5 kg plus 750 grams. So that's 5.75 kg of salt per day.

But then again, the rice part is 18 kg 300 grams, which is 18.3 kg, but if"

First, I need to determine how many prime numbers are between 1 and 10. The numbers in this range are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Starting with 2: It is the smallest prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 2.

Next, 3: It is also prime since it can only be divided by 1 and 3.

4: This number is not prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4.

5: It is prime as its only divisors are 1 and 5.

6: Not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

7: Prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 7.

8: Not prime as it has multiple divisors, including 1, 2, 4, and 8.

9: Not prime because it can be divided by 1, 3, and 9.

10: Not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2, 5, and 10.

So, the prime numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. That makes a total of 4 prime numbers.

There are 10 numbers in total (from 1 to 10). Out of these, 4 are prime numbers. To find the fraction of prime numbers, I divide the number of primes by the total number of numbers.

Therefore, the fraction is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.

So, the total number of whole numbers between 1 and 10 that are prime is 4, which represents a fraction of 2/5.

First, I need to translate the problem into English to understand it clearly.

""Fatema and Shakil are trying to divide 210 taka in the ratio 3:4. How many taka should be given to Shakil?""

Next, I'll solve the problem step by step.

The total ratio parts are 3 + 4 = 7.

Each part is equal to 210 taka divided by 7, which is 30 taka.

Since Shakil's share is 4 parts, I multiply 4 by 30 taka to get his total amount.

Therefore, Shakil should receive 120 taka.

**Translation:**  
Fatema and Shakil are trying to divide 210 taka in the ratio 3:4. How many taka should be given to Shakil?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**  
   The ratio 3:4 means that for every 3 parts Fatema gets, Shakil gets 4 parts.  
   Total parts = 3 + 4 = 7 parts.

2. **Calculating the Value of Each Part:**  
   Total amount = 210 taka.  
   Each part = Total amount ÷ Total parts = 210 ÷ 7 = 30 taka.

First, I recognize that the product of the two positive perfect squares is 1576, and their ratio is 9/7. I need to find the smaller number.

I'll denote the two perfect squares as \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, and \( a > b \).

Given the ratio:
\[
\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \frac{9}{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}}
\]
However, since \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, \( b \) must be a multiple of \( \sqrt{7} \) to make \( a \) an integer. This suggests that \( b = k \sqrt{7} \) for some integer \( k \), and \( a = k \times 3 \).

Next, using the product:
\[
a^2 \times b^2 = 1576
\]
Substituting:
\[
( (k \times 3)^2 ) \times ( (k \sqrt{7})^2 ) = 1576
\]
Simplifying:
\[
9k^2 \times 7k^2 = 63k^4 = 1576
\]
Solving for \( k^4 \):
\[
k^4 = \frac{1576}{63} = 25 \implies k^2 = 5 \implies k = \sqrt{5}
\]
However, \( k \) must be an integer, so I realize there might be an error in my approach.

I'll try setting \( a = 3m \) and \( b = 7n \), leading to:
\[
a^2 \times b^2 = 9m^2 \times 49n^2 = 441 m^2 n^2 = 1576
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
m^2 n^2 = 4
\]
Assuming \( m \) and \( n \) are integers, the possible pairs for \( (m, n) \) are \( (1, 2) \) and \( (2, 1) \).

First, convert all measurements to meters to ensure consistency. The length remains 48 meters. The width given is 32 meters and 80 centimeters, which is equivalent to 32.8 meters.

Next, calculate the total area of the field by multiplying the length by the width:
48 m * 32.8 m = 1574.4 square meters.

Now, account for the surrounding road. The road adds an additional 3 meters on each side. Therefore, the total length including the road becomes:
48 m + 3 m + 3 m = 54 meters.

Similarly, the total width including the road is:
32.8 m + 3 m + 3 m = 38.8 meters.

Calculate the total area including the road:
54 m * 38.8 m = 2093.2 square meters.

Finally, find the area of the road by subtracting the area of the original field from the total area:
2093.2 m² - 1574.4 m² = 518.8 square meters.

**Solution:**

1. **Convert Units:**
   - Length of the field = 48 meters
   - Width of the field = 32 meters 80 centimeters = 32.8 meters

2. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3:
\[
x^2 = \frac{147}{3} = 49

Next, I calculate the area of the inner garden by multiplying its length by its width: 72 meters multiplied by 52 meters equals 3744 square meters.

Then, I find the area of the original garden: 80 meters times 60 meters equals 4800 square meters.

The area of the path is the difference between the original area and the inner garden area: 4800 minus 3744 equals 56 square meters.

Finally, I multiply the area of the path by the cost per square meter to find the total cost: 56 times 7.25 equals 406. This means the cost to construct the path is 406 taka.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
A rectangular garden with a length of 80 meters and a width of 60 meters has a pathway surrounding it that is 4 meters wide. The pathway is to be constructed at a cost of 7.25 taka per square meter. What is the total cost to construct the pathway?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Inner Garden Dimensions:**
   - **Inner Length** = Original Length - 2 × Path Width = 80 m - 2×4 m = 72 m
   - **Inner Width** = Original Width - 2 × Path Width = 60 m - 2×4 m = 52 m

2. **Calculate the Area of the Inner Garden:**
   \[
   \text{Inner Area} = \text{Inner Length} × \text{Inner Width} = 72\,m × 52\,m = 3744\,m^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the Area of the Original Garden:**
   \[
   \text{Original Area} = 80\,m × 60\,m = 4800\,m^2

 bonne. Let's try to figure out this problem step by step. 

So, we have two trees: a Banyan tree and a Pine tree. The problem gives us information about their ages in the past and asks us to find their combined age in the future. 

First, it mentions that 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. That gives us one equation. 

Then, it tells us that currently, the Pine tree is 1432 years old. We need to find the current age of the Banyan tree. 

Once we have both current ages, we can add 200 years to each and then sum them up to get the total age after 200 years.
</think>

**Translation:**

In a park, there is a Banyan tree and a Pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of both trees was 2961 years. Currently, the Pine tree is 1432 years old. After 200 years, the sum of the ages of both trees will be ______ years.

**Solution:**

1. **Current Age of the Pine Tree (P):**
   - Present age of Pine tree, \( P = 1432 \) years.

2. **Current Age of the Banyan Tree (B):**
   - 150 years ago, the age of Banyan tree was \( B - 150 \).
   - 150 years ago, the age of Pine tree was \( P - 150 \).
   - Sum of their ages 150 years ago: 
     \[
     (B - 150) + (P - 150) = 2961
     \]
   - Substitute \( P = 1432 \):
     \[
     B - 150 + 1432 - 150 = 2961
     \]
     \[
     B + 1132 = 2961
     \]
     \[
     B = 2961 - 1132 = 1829 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Age of Both Trees After 200 Years:**
   - Future age of Banyan tree: \( 1829 + 200 = 2029 \) years.
   - Future age of Pine tree: \( 1432 + 200 = 1632 \) years.
   - Sum of their future ages:

First, let's translate the problem into English to understand it better. The problem states:

""A part of a stick is 1/6 in the ground, 1/2 in the water, and the remaining part above the water. The length of the part above the water is 2 meters. We need to find out the length of the stick underwater.""

Next, let's break down the problem.

Let's denote the entire length of the stick as \( L \).

According to the problem:
- The portion above water is \( \frac{1}{3}L \), which is given as 2 meters.
  
We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3}L = 2 \, \text{meters}
\]
Solving for \( L \):
\[
L = 2 \times 3 = 6 \, \text{meters}
\]
The portion of the stick in the ground is \( \frac{1}{6}L \). Plugging in \( L = 6 \, \text{meters} \):
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 6 = 1 \, \text{meter}
\]
</think>

**Translation:**  
A portion of a stick is \(\frac{1}{6}\) in the ground, \(\frac{1}{2}\) in the water, and the remaining portion is above the water. The length of the portion above the water is 2 meters. We need to determine the length of the stick that is underground.

---

**Solution:**

Let the total length of the stick be \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
- The portion above water is \(\frac{1}{3}L\), which is given as 2 meters.

Set up the equation for the portion above water:
\[
\frac{1}{3}L = 2 \, \text{meters}
\]
Solve for \( L \):
\[
L = 2 \times 3 = 6 \, \text{meters}
\]

Now, find the length of the stick in the ground:
\[
\text{Length in ground} = \frac{1}{6}L = \frac{1}{6} \times 6 = 1 \, \text{meter}

First, I need to define the variables for the length and the width of the rectangular land. Let's let the width be \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length is three times the width, so the length can be expressed as \( 3w \) meters.

Next, I'll recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]
Substituting the expressions for length and width into the formula gives:
\[
40 = 2 \times (3w + w)
\]
Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[
40 = 2 \times 4w
\]
\[
40 = 8w
\]
To solve for \( w \), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
w = \frac{40}{8}
\]
\[
w = 5
\]
So, the width of the land is 5 meters.
</think>

# Solution:

Let's denote the width of the rectangular land as \( w \) meters. According to the problem, the length of the land is three times the width, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Length} = 3w

The perimeter (\( P \)) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})

Substituting the known values into the formula:

\[
40 = 2 \times (3w + w)
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
40 = 2 \times 4w
\]

\[
40 = 8w

Solve for \( w \):

\[
w = \frac{40}{8}

\[
w = 5

First, I need to understand the initial price of paddy. It is given as 1,080 Taka per quintal.

The price increases by 15% during the rainy season. To find the increased price, I calculate 15% of 1,080 Taka, which is 162 Taka. Adding this to the original price, the new price becomes 1,242 Taka per quintal.

The farmer sold 12 quintals before the price increase. Initially, the earnings would be 12 quintals multiplied by 1,080 Taka, totaling 12,960 Taka. After the price increase, selling the same 12 quintals would earn 12 times 1,242 Taka, which equals 14,904 Taka.

To find out how much more money the farmer would earn, I subtract the initial earnings from the increased earnings: 14,904 Taka minus 12,960 Taka equals 1,944 Taka.

Therefore, the farmer would earn 1,944 Taka more by selling the paddy during the rainy season.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Initial Price Calculation**

- **Price before the rainy season:** 1,080 Taka per quintal.
- **Number of quintals sold:** 12 quintals.

**Initial earnings:**
\[
12 \text{ quintals} \times 1,080 \text{ Taka/quintal} = 12,960 \text{ Taka}
\]

**Step 2: Price Increase During Rainy Season**

- **Percentage increase:** 15%.

\[
\text{Increased amount} = 15\% \times 1,080 \text{ Taka} = 0.15 \times 1,080 = 162 \text{ Taka}
\]

- **New price per quintal:**
\[
1,080 \text{ Taka} + 162 \text{ Taka} = 1,242 \text{ Taka}
\]

**Step 3: Earnings During Rainy Season**

\[
12 \text{ quintals} \times 1,242 \text{ Taka/quintal} = 14,904 \text{ Taka}

 Transportation of the problem:

The problem states: 

""৫৮৩৪ থেকে ক্ষুদ্রতম _____ সংখ্যাটি বিয়োগ করলে বিয়োগফল ২০, ২৮, ৩২ ও ৩৫ দিয়ে বিভাজ্�্য হবে।""

Translated into English, it means:

""From 5834, the smallest ______ number subtracted will make the difference divisible by 20, 28, 32, and 35.""

First, identify the blank in the problem. It seems like there’s a missing term in the original problem, which I assume is ""four-digit"" or another adjective.

Assuming the blank refers to a ""four-digit"" number, but since 5834 is a four-digit number, subtracting another number to get a result that's divisible by the given divisors is more plausible.

The divisors given are 20, 28, 32, and 35. To find a number that is divisible by all of them, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

Calculate the LCM of 20, 28, 32, and 35.

Start by factorizing each number:
- 20 = 2^2 * 5
- 28 = 2^2 * 7
- 32 = 2^5
- 35 = 5 * 7

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
LCM = 2^5 * 5 * 7 = 32 * 5 * 7 = 32 * 35 = 1120

Now, find the largest multiple of 1120 that is less than or equal to 5834. 

Divide 5834 by 1120:

5834 ÷ 1120 ≈ 5.21

So, the largest integer less than this is 5. Therefore, 5 * 1120 = 5600.

The difference between 5834 and 5600 is:

5834 - 5600 = 234

So, the smallest number to subtract is 234.

First, I need to identify the largest number that, when it divides both 2300 and 3500, leaves remainders of 32 and 56 respectively. 

Let's start by subtracting the remainders from the original numbers to find the adjusted numbers:
- For 2300: 2300 - 32 = 2268
- For 3500: 3500 - 56 = 3444

Now, the largest number that divides both 2268 and 3444 exactly is their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

To find the GCD of 2268 and 3444 using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. Divide 3444 by 2268, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1176.
2. Next, divide 2268 by 1176, resulting in a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1092.
3. Then, divide 1176 by 1092, yielding a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 84.
4. Finally, divide 1092 by 84, which gives a quotient of 13 and a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is 84. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is 84.

Thus, the largest number that satisfies the given conditions is 84.
</think>

**Translated Problem:**
The largest _____ number, when it divides 2300 and 3500, leaves remainders of 32 and 56 respectively.

**Solution:**

Let the largest number be \( x \).

Given:
- When \( x \) divides 2300, the remainder is 32.  
  This implies:  
  \( 2300 \div x = q_1 \) with a remainder of 32.  
  So, \( 2300 = q_1 \cdot x + 32 \)  
  \( \Rightarrow q_1 \cdot x = 2300 - 32 = 2268 \)  
  \( \Rightarrow x \) must be a divisor of 2268.

- When \( x \) divides 3500, the remainder is 56.  
  This implies:  
  \( 3500 \div x = q_2 \) with a remainder of 56.  
  So, \( 3500 = q_2 \cdot x + 56 \)

LOL, okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It's about two cricket players, Imran and Sumon, and their total runs in a match. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that the total runs scored by both Imran and Sumon together is 58. That part seems straightforward—it's giving me the sum of their runs. So if I let Imran's runs be represented by one variable and Sumon's by another, together they add up to 58.

Now, the tricky part comes next. It says that Imran's runs are 5 less than twice Sumon's runs. Hmm, okay. So Imran's runs are dependent on Sumon's. That means I can express Imran's runs in terms of Sumon's runs. Let me think about how to translate that into an equation.

I think it would make sense to assign variables first. Let me call Sumon's runs S and Imran's runs I. So, from the first piece of information, I know that I + S = 58.

The second part says Imran's runs are 5 less than twice Sumon's. So, that would be I = 2S - 5. That makes sense because if Sumon has S runs, twice that is 2S, and then subtracting 5 gives me Imran's runs.

Now, I can substitute this expression for I into the first equation. So, I have (2S - 5) + S = 58. Combining like terms, that's 3S - 5 = 58.

Next, I need to solve for S. Let's add 5 to both sides to get rid of the negative number. So, 3S = 58 + 5, which is 63. Then, divide both sides by 3, and I get S = 21. That means Sumon scored 21 runs.

Now that I know Sumon's runs, I can find Imran's by plugging back into one of the equations. Using I = 2S -5, so I = 2*21 -5, which is 42 -5, giving I = 37. So, Imran scored 37 runs.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Sumon scored 21 and Imran scored 37, together that's 21 + 37 = 58, which"

Okay, so I need to solve this math problem. Let's read it carefully and figure out what it's asking.

Alright, the problem is about two trees in a park: a Banyan tree and a Pine tree. It says that 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. Right now, the Pine tree is 1432 years old. The question is, in 200 years, how old will the Banyan tree be?

So, the first thing I need to do is break down the information given and set up some equations to solve this.

Let me define two variables to represent the current ages of both trees. Let's say:

- Let B = current age of the Banyan tree
- Let P = current age of the Pine tree

From the problem, I know that P, the Pine tree, is currently 1432 years old. So, P = 1432.

Now, the other piece of information is that 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961. That means if we take each tree's current age and subtract 150 years, their total will be 2961.

So, in equation form, that's:

(B - 150) + (P - 150) = 2961

Since we already know that P is 1432, I can substitute that into the equation.

So plugging P in:

(B - 150) + (1432 - 150) = 2961

Let me compute 1432 minus 150 first. 1432 - 150 is 1282.

So the equation becomes:

(B - 150) + 1282 = 2961

Now I can simplify this. Let's combine the terms on the left:

B - 150 + 1282 = B + (1282 - 150) = B + 1132

So:

B + 1132 = 2961

To find B, subtract 1132 from both sides:

B = 2961 - 1132

Let me do that subtraction. 2961 - 1000 is 1961, then subtract 132 more: 1961 - 132 = 1829.

So the current age of the Banyan tree is 1829 years.

Now, the question is asking how old the Banyan tree will be in 200 years. So we just add 200 to its current age.

First, I need to translate the problem into English to understand it fully. It states that Sakir has 450 yellow buttons and tries to arrange them in a square shape. After arranging them, there are 9 buttons left over. My task is to determine how many buttons are in each row of Sakir's arrangement.

To solve this, I recognize that arranging buttons in a square means finding the largest perfect square less than or equal to 450. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, such as 10² = 100, 11² = 121, and so on.

I calculate the square root of 450 to find the nearest integer. The square root of 450 is approximately 21.213. Since we need a whole number, I take the integer part, which is 21. Squaring this gives 21² = 441, which is less than 450.

Subtracting 441 from 450 leaves a remainder of 9, which matches the problem's statement. Therefore, the number of buttons in each row is 21.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**

Sakir counted and found he has 450 yellow buttons. He tried to arrange them in a square shape. After arranging them in a square, there were 9 yellow buttons left. In each row of Sakir's arrangement, there are _____ yellow buttons.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the number of buttons in each row of Sakir's square arrangement.

1. **Total Buttons (N):** 450
2. **Remainder (R):** 9

We need to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to \(N - R = 450 - 9 = 441\). 

\[
\sqrt{441} = 21
\]

So, in a square arrangement, there are **21 buttons in each row**.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a room with a floor that's 4 meters in length and 3.5 meters in width. The height of the room is 3 meters, and each of the four walls is 15 centimeters thick. We need to find the volume of these four walls in cubic meters.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. The room has four walls, two with the same length as the floor and the other two with the same width as the floor. Since the walls have thickness, they occupy some volume within the room. So, the total volume of the walls would be the sum of the volumes of each wall.

Let me break it down:

1. **Calculate the volume of the longer walls:**
   - The length of the longer walls is the same as the floor's length, which is 4 meters.
   - The height of the walls is 3 meters.
   - The thickness is given as 15 cm, which I need to convert to meters because the other measurements are in meters. 15 cm is 0.15 meters.
   
   So, the volume for one long wall would be:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{height} \times \text{thickness} = 4 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m} \times 0.15 \, \text{m}
   \]
   Calculating that:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12
   \]
   \[
   12 \times 0.15 = 1.8 \, \text{cubic meters}
   \]
   Since there are two such walls, their combined volume would be:
   \[
   1.8 \, \text{m}^3 \times 2 = 3.6 \, \text{m}^3
   \]

2. **Calculate the volume of the shorter walls:**
   - The width of the shorter walls is the same as the floor's width, which is 3.5 meters.
   - The height remains 3 meters.
   - The thickness is still 0.15 meters.
   
   So, the volume for one short wall is:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 3.5 \, \text{m} \times"

First, I need to understand the problem. It states that an initial principal amount of 6,500 rupees generates a compound interest of 8,840 rupees over 4 years, resulting in a total of 15,340 rupees. I need to determine the same annual interest rate that would cause another principal amount to grow to 10,200 rupees over the same 4-year period.

First, I'll calculate the compound interest for the initial amount. The final amount A is given by the formula:

A = P (1 + r/100)^t

Where:
- P = principal amount = 6,500 rupees
- t = time in years = 4

The final amount after 4 years is 6,500 + 8,840 = 15,340 rupees.

So, 15,340 = 6,500 * (1 + r/100)^4

To find the rate r, I'll divide both sides by 6,500:

(15,340 / 6,500) = (1 + r/100)^4

Calculating the left side:

15,340 / 6,500 ≈ 2.357

Taking the fourth root of both sides to solve for (1 + r/100):

1 + r/100 = 2.357^(1/4)

Approximating the fourth root of 2.357, I find that it's around 1.2, so:

r ≈ (1.2 - 1) * 100 = 20%

Next, using this interest rate of 20% to find the principal amount that would yield 10,200 rupees in 4 years:

A = P (1 + 20/100)^4

10,200 = P * (1.2)^4

Calculating (1.2)^4:

1.2^4 = 2.0736

So,

P = 10,200 / 2.0736 ≈ 5,000 rupees

Therefore, the principal amount is approximately 5,000 rupees.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
At what rate percent does ₹6,500 yield ₹8,840 as compound interest over 4 years? Use the same rate to find the principal amount that would yield ₹10,200 as compound interest over the same period.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculating the Rate:**

   The formula for compound interest is:

First, I need to translate the problem from Bengali to English. The given numbers are 28, 33, 42, and 77. The task is to find the number closest to 98,765 that is divisible by all these numbers.

To solve this, I'll calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. 

Starting with 28, 33, 42, and 77, I'll break each down into their prime factors:
- 28 = 2² × 7
- 33 = 3 × 11
- 42 = 2 × 3 × 7
- 77 = 7 × 11

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations:
- For 2: the highest power is 2²
- For 3: the highest power is 3
- For 7: the highest power is 7
- For 11: the highest power is 11

So, LCM = 2² × 3 × 7 × 11 = 4 × 3 × 7 × 11 = 924.

Now, I need to find a multiple of 924 that is closest to 98,765. Dividing 98,765 by 924 gives approximately 106.9. This means the closest multiples are 106 × 924 = 97,944 and 107 × 924 = 98,868.

Comparing these two multiples to 98,765:
- 98,765 - 97,944 = 821
- 98,868 - 98,765 = 103

Since 98,868 is closer to 98,765, with a difference of just 103, it is the number we're looking for.

Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how much money Sita has. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the problem says that Sita has 390 less than Raayan. Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. It says, ""Sita has 390 more than Raayan."" Hmm, no, wait, let me check the translation. Oh, okay, the correct translation is: Sita has more than Raayan by 390 taka. So, Sita has Raayan's amount plus 390.

Then, it goes on to say that Shimul has 470 more than Sita. Wait, no, again, I need to be careful here. It actually says, ""Shimul has 470 less than Sita."" Or is it the other way around? Let me double-check. Oh, no, wait: the translation says, ""Shimul has 470 less than Sita."" So, that means Shimul has Sita's amount minus 470.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because later it says that Shimul has 890 taka. So, let's clarify. Let's break it down step by step.

Let me assign variables to each person to make it easier. Let's say:

- Let R be the amount Raayan has.
- Let S be the amount Sita has.
- Let H be the amount Shimul has.

From the problem:

1. Sita has 390 more than Raayan. So, in equation form: S = R + 390.

2. Shimul has 470 less than Sita. So that would be: H = S - 470.

3. We are told that Shimul has 890 taka. So, H = 890.

Our goal is to find out how much Sita has, which is S.

So, from the third point, H = 890. Using the second equation, which is H = S - 470, we can substitute H with 890:

890 = S - 470

To solve for S, we can add 470 to both sides:

890 + 470 = S

So, 890 + 470 equals... let me calculate that. 800 + 400 is 1200, and 90 + 70 is 160, so total is 1360. So, 1360 = S.

First, I need to determine the total number of lychees that Raju and Roni have together, which is 690.

It is given that Raju has 86 fewer lychees than Roni. Let's denote the number of lychees Raju has as R.

Since Roni has 86 more lychees than Raju, Roni has R + 86 lychees.

The sum of their lychees is R + (R + 86) = 690.

Simplifying the equation: 2R + 86 = 690.

Subtracting 86 from both sides: 2R = 604.

Dividing both sides by 2: R = 302.
</think>

**Problem:**
Raju and Roni together have 690 lychees. Raju has 86 fewer lychees than Roni. How many lychees does Raju have?

**Solution:**

Let's denote the number of lychees Raju has as \( R \).

Since Raju has 86 fewer lychees than Roni, Roni has \( R + 86 \) lychees.

Together, they have:
\[
R + (R + 86) = 690
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
2R + 86 = 690
\]

Subtract 86 from both sides:
\[
2R = 604
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
R = 302

First, I need to determine the difference in the distances Shahil and Munna jumped.

Shahil jumped 182.88 cm, and Munna jumped 179.25 cm.

To find out how much further Shahil jumped compared to Munna, I subtract Munna's jump distance from Shahil's jump distance.

So, 182.88 cm minus 179.25 cm equals 3.63 cm.

Therefore, Shahil jumped 3.63 cm more than Munna.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

We are given the distances jumped by Shahil and Munna in the long jump competition:

- Shahil jumped **182.88 cm**.
- Munna jumped **179.25 cm**.

To find out how much more Shahil jumped compared to Munna, we subtract Munna's jump distance from Shahil's jump distance:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Shahil's jump} - \text{Munna's jump}
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 182.88\, \text{cm} - 179.25\, \text{cm}
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 3.63\, \text{cm}

Alright, let's try to solve this problem. It's about dividing money among three brothers, and I need to figure out how much each of them gets, especially focusing on Dalim. 

So, the problem says that the father has 6300 taka to distribute among the three sons: Sabuj, Dalim, and Lincoln. The way it's divided is a bit specific. It mentions that Sabuj gets 3/5 of what Dalim gets, and Dalim gets twice as much as Lincoln. 

Hmm, okay. So, let's try to break it down. First, I need to relate each brother's share based on these ratios. 

Let me denote Lincoln's share as L. According to the problem, Dalim receives twice what Lincoln gets, so if Lincoln has L, then Dalim has 2L. 

Now, Sabuj's share is 3/5 of Dalim's. Since Dalim has 2L, Sabuj gets (3/5)*2L. Let me calculate that. 3/5 times 2 is 6/5, so Sabuj has (6/5)L. 

So now, all shares are in terms of L. Let's list them out:

- Sabuj: (6/5)L
- Dalim: 2L
- Lincoln: L

Since the total amount is 6300 taka, the sum of their shares should equal this. So, I can add up all the shares:

(6/5)L + 2L + L = 6300

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. Yes, Sabuj is 6/5 L, Dalim is 2L, and Lincoln is L. So, adding them together:

6/5 L + 2L + L = (6/5 + 3)L = (6/5 + 15/5) L = (21/5)L

So, (21/5) times L equals 6300. To find L, I can solve for L:

(21/5)L = 6300

Multiply both sides by 5:

21L = 31500

Now, divide both sides by 21:

L = 31500 / 21

Let me do that division. 21 times 1500 is 31500, because 21*1000 is 21000, and 21*500 is 10500; 21000 + "

First, I need to determine the total number of shutters that need to be painted. Since there are 2 windows and each window has 2 shutters, the total number of shutters is 2 multiplied by 2, which equals 4.

Next, I need to calculate the time it takes to paint each shutter. The problem states that each shutter takes 2 hours and 15 minutes. To make the calculation easier, I'll convert the time into minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes, so adding the 15 minutes gives me a total of 135 minutes per shutter.

Now, to find the total time required to paint all 4 shutters, I multiply the time per shutter by the number of shutters: 135 minutes multiplied by 4 equals 540 minutes.

Finally, I'll convert the total time back into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I'll divide 540 by 60, which gives me 9 hours. Therefore, Debubabu will take a total of 9 hours to paint both windows.

First, I need to understand the given ratios. The problem states that k to l is 4:7, and l to m is 10:7.

To combine these ratios into a single proportion, k:l:m, I'll need to find a common term for l in both ratios. Currently, in the first ratio, l is 7, and in the second ratio, l is 10. The least common multiple of 7 and 10 is 70.

Next, I'll adjust both ratios so that l becomes 70 in each. For the first ratio, k:l = 4:7, I'll multiply both parts by 10 to get k:l = 40:70. For the second ratio, l:m = 10:7, I'll multiply both parts by 7 to get l:m = 70:49.

Now that both ratios have l = 70, I can combine them into a single ratio: k:l:m = 40:70:49.

Finally, the ratio of k to l to m is 40:70:49.

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is in Bengali, but I'll translate it first to make sure I understand it correctly. It says, ""The selling price of a car is equal to 45 parts of its cost price. What percentage of profit or loss will there be?"" 

Okay, so we're dealing with cost price (CP) and selling price (SP). The SP is given as 45 parts of the CP. I think that means SP is 45% of the CP, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe ""45 parts"" translates directly to 45%, but I should double-check that. 

Let's assume the cost price is 100 units for simplicity. If CP is 100, and SP is 45% of that, then SP would be 45 units. So, selling price is 45 when cost price is 100. Now, I need to calculate the profit or loss percentage. 

To do that, I remember the formula: Profit or Loss Percentage = (Profit or Loss / Cost Price) * 100. 

In this case, since the selling price is less than the cost price, there's a loss. The loss amount is CP - SP, which is 100 - 45 = 55 units. 

Now, applying the formula: Loss Percentage = (55 / 100) * 100 = 55%. 

Hmm, but let me think again. Did I interpret the problem correctly? The selling price is 45 parts of the cost price. If each part is the same as a percentage point, then 45 parts would indeed be 45%. 

Alternatively, sometimes ""parts"" can be a bit confusing. For example, if the cost price is divided into 100 parts, then each part is 1% of the cost price. So, 45 parts would still be 45%. 

Wait, but sometimes in problems, ""parts"" might refer to fractions. Like, 45 parts could mean 45/100, which is also 45%. That still leads me to the same conclusion. 

So, loss is 55, which is 55% of the cost price. Therefore, the percentage loss would be 55%. 

I think that's correct. The selling price is less than the cost price, indicating a loss, and the percentage is calculated based on the cost price. 

To summarize: 
- CP = 100 units
- SP = 45"

First, I need to extract the information provided in the problem.

The total interest over a certain period (T years) is ₹5,600. Additionally, the interest is 2/5 of the principal amount. The annual interest rate is 8%.

I'll denote the principal as P and the time as T.

Given that the interest is 2/5 of the principal, I can set up the equation:
Interest = (2/5) * P

But the problem also states that the total interest earned is ₹5,600, so:
(2/5) * P = 5,600

From this, I can solve for P:
P = (5,600 * 5) / 2 = 14,000

Now that I have the principal amount, I can use the simple interest formula to find the time T:
Interest = (P * R * T) / 100
5,600 = (14,000 * 8 * T) / 100

Solving for T:
T = (5,600 * 100) / (14,000 * 8) = 5 years
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
_______ years time's interest and principal sum up to ₹5,600, and the interest is \( \frac{2}{5} \) part of the principal. The rate of interest is 8% per annum.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Let’s Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( P \) = Principal
   - Let \( T \) = Time in years
   - Rate (\( R \)) = 8% per annum
   - Interest (\( I \)) = \( \frac{2}{5}P \)
   - Total Amount (\( A \)) = \( P + I = P + \frac{2}{5}P = \frac{7}{5}P \)

First, I recognize that the problem involves dividing a certain amount of money among three individuals—Labib, Sami, and Siyam—in a specific ratio of 5:4:2.

Next, I note that Siyam received 180 taka. Since the ratio of Siyam's share is 2, I can determine the value of one part of the ratio by dividing 180 by 2, which equals 90 taka per part.

With the value of one part known, I can calculate Sami's share by multiplying the number of parts corresponding to him, which is 4, by the value of each part (90 taka). This gives Sami a total of 360 taka.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
A certain amount of money was divided among Labib, Sami, and Siyam in the ratio of 5:4:2. If Siyam received 180 taka, how much money will Sami receive?
