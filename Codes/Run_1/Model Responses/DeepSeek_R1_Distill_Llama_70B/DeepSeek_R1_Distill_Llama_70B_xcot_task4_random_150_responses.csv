First, I need to understand what is being asked in the problem.

The problem states that the shopkeeper buys fabric at a rate of 125 Taka per meter and sells it at 150 Taka per meter, making a profit of 2000 Taka. I need to find out how many meters of fabric the shopkeeper bought.

To find the total meters purchased, I should calculate the profit per meter first. The profit per meter is the selling price minus the buying price, which is 150 Taka - 125 Taka, equaling 25 Taka per meter.

Next, I can determine the total number of meters by dividing the total profit by the profit per meter. That would be 2000 Taka divided by 25 Taka per meter.

This calculation will give me the total meters of fabric the shopkeeper purchased.
</think>

**Translation of the problem:**

At the rate of ৳ 125 per meter, cloth is purchased and sold at ৳ 150 per meter, making a profit of ৳ 2,000 for the shopkeeper. How many meters of cloth did the shopkeeper purchase in total?

---

**Solution:**

Let's determine the total meters of cloth the shopkeeper purchased step by step.

1. **Calculate the profit per meter:**
   
   \[
   \text{Profit per meter} = \text{Selling price per meter} - \text{Cost price per meter}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Profit per meter} = 150 \, \text{৳} - 125 \, \text{৳} = 25 \, \text{৳}
   \]

2. **Determine the total meters purchased:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Profit per meter} \times \text{Total meters}
   \]
   
   \[
   2000 \, \text{৳} = 25 \, \text{৳/meter} \times \text{Total meters}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total meters} = \frac{2000 \, \text{৳}}{25 \, \text{৳/meter}} = 80 \, \text{meters}
   \]

First, I need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three amounts: 420, 560, and 630. 

Starting with 420 and 560, I apply the Euclidean algorithm. I divide 560 by 420, which gives a remainder of 140. Then, I divide 420 by 140, resulting in a remainder of 0. So, the GCD of 420 and 560 is 140.

Next, I find the GCD of 140 and 630. Dividing 630 by 140 leaves a remainder of 0, indicating that 140 is also the GCD of these two numbers.

Therefore, 140 is the greatest common divisor of 420, 560, and 630 Taka.
</think>

### Step-by-Step Solution:

We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the following three numbers: 420 Rs, 560 Rs, and 630 Rs.

1. **Find GCD of 420 and 560:**
   - Apply the Euclidean algorithm:
     - 560 ÷ 420 = 1 with a remainder of 140
     - 420 ÷ 140 = 3 with a remainder of 0
   - So, GCD(420, 560) = 140

2. **Find GCD of 140 and 630:**
   - Apply the Euclidean algorithm:
     - 630 ÷ 140 = 4 with a remainder of 70
     - 140 ÷ 70 = 2 with a remainder of 0
   - So, GCD(140, 630) = 70

3. **Determine the Final GCD:**
   - The GCD of all three numbers is the GCD obtained in the final step, which is **70**.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   The problem states that a goat was sold at a 10% loss. If the selling price had been 450 rupees higher, it would have resulted in a 5% profit. We need to find the cost price (C.P.) of the goat.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let the cost price be \( C.P. \)
   - Selling price at 10% loss: \( S.P. = C.P. - 0.10 \times C.P. = 0.90 \times C.P. \)
   - If the selling price were 450 rupees higher, the new selling price would be \( S.P. + 450 = 0.90 \times C.P. + 450 \)
   - This new selling price results in a 5% profit: \( S.P. + 450 = C.P. + 0.05 \times C.P. = 1.05 \times C.P. \)

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   \[
   0.90 \times C.P. + 450 = 1.05 \times C.P.
   \]

4. **Solve for \( C.P. \):**
   \[
   450 = 1.05 \times C.P. - 0.90 \times C.P.
   \]
   \[
   450 = 0.15 \times C.P.

First, I need to determine the area of the square field. Since each side of the square is 300 meters, the area is 300 meters multiplied by 300 meters, which equals 90,000 square meters.

Next, there is a 4-meter wide road surrounding the square field on all four sides. This road forms a larger square around the original field. To find the area of the larger square, I calculate the length of one side, which is 300 meters plus twice the width of the road (4 meters on each side). Therefore, the side length is 300 + 2*4 = 308 meters. The area of the larger square is 308 meters multiplied by 308 meters, resulting in 94,864 square meters.

Finally, to find the area of the road, I subtract the area of the original square field from the area of the larger square. So, 94,864 square meters minus 90,000 square meters equals 4,864 square meters.
</think>

**Translated Problem:**
A square field has one side of length 300 meters, and there is a 4-meter wide road around it on all four sides. What is the area of the road in square meters?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Area of the Square Field:**
   - The field is square, so both the length and width are 300 meters.
   - Area of the field = length × width = 300 m × 300 m = 90,000 m².

2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Larger Square (Including the Road):**
   - The road adds an extra 4 meters on each side of the field.
   - Therefore, the total length of one side including the road is:
     \[
     \text{Total side length} = 300\, \text{m} + 2 \times 4\, \text{m} = 308\, \text{m}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Area of the Larger Square:**
   - Area of the larger square = side length × side length = 308 m × 308 m.
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     308 \times 308 = 94,864\, \text{m}²

Alright, so I've got this math problem here in Bengali. Let's translate it first to make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem says: ""There are two smallest consecutive numbers whose squares differ by a perfect square. The smaller number will be ____.""

Okay, so I need to find two consecutive numbers, let's say n and n+1, such that when I square both and subtract them, the result is a perfect square. And I need the smallest such n.

First, let me write down the equation. The squares of the numbers are n² and (n+1)². The difference between them is (n+1)² - n². Let me compute that:

(n+1)² = n² + 2n + 1

So, (n+1)² - n² = 2n + 1

According to the problem, this difference, 2n + 1, must be a perfect square. Let's denote that perfect square as k². So we have:

2n + 1 = k²

We can rearrange this to express n in terms of k:

n = (k² - 1)/2

Since n must be a positive integer, (k² - 1) must be even, which means k² must be odd. Therefore, k itself must be odd because the square of an even number is even, and the square of an odd number is odd.

So, let's try the smallest odd integers for k and see what n comes out to be.

Starting with k = 1:

n = (1² - 1)/2 = (1 - 1)/2 = 0/2 = 0

Hmm, but the problem probably wants positive integers, so let's try the next odd number.

k = 3:

n = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4

So when n = 4, let's check the squares:

4² = 16
5² = 25
Difference: 25 - 16 = 9

And 9 is indeed a perfect square (3²). So that works.

Wait, but maybe I skipped k=1 because n=0 isn't positive, but in mathematics, sometimes 0 is included. The problem mentions ""consecutive numbers,"" and 0 and 1 are consecutive integers, but I'm not sure if they consider 0 as a valid starting point"

Alright, so I've got this problem here where someone is saving 850 taka each month, and we need to find out after how many months their savings will exceed 50,000 taka. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I think I should understand what exactly is being asked. It's a savings problem where a fixed amount is added every month, so it's like an arithmetic sequence where each term represents the total savings after each month.

Let me define the variables. Let's say the number of months is n. Each month, the person saves 850 taka, so after n months, the total savings would be 850 multiplied by n. But wait, I need to check if this is a simple multiplication or if there's any catch. Since it's a consistent saving, I think it's a straightforward multiplication.

So the equation is 850 * n > 50,000.

Now, to find out when this will happen, I can solve for n.

Dividing both sides by 850 gives n > 50,000 / 850.

Calculating that, 50,000 divided by 850. Let me do that step by step. 850 times 50 is 42,500, right? So 50,000 minus 42,500 leaves 7,500. Then, 7,500 divided by 850 is roughly 8.8235. So adding that to the 50, I get n > 58.8235.

But n has to be a whole number because you can't have a fraction of a month in this context. So if n is 58.8235, that means after 59 months, the savings will exceed 50,000.

Let me verify that. 850 * 58 = 49,300, which is less than 50,000. Then, 850 * 59 = 50,150, which is indeed more than 50,000. So that checks out.

Wait, did I make any calculation errors? Let me double-check.

50,000 divided by 850. Hmm, 850 times 60 is 51,000, so 50,000 would be a little less than 60. Let me do exact division: 50,000 divided by 850 is the same as 50000/850. Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 5000/85. Then, dividing both by 5: "

First, identify the initial amount of flour, the number of students, and the number of days it was intended to last.

There are 150 kg of flour for 20 students over 30 days.

Next, account for the spoilage of 30 kg, reducing the usable flour to 120 kg.

Since 5 students have left, the remaining number of students is 15.

Calculate the total consumption rate by multiplying the number of students by the number of days: 20 students * 30 days = 600 student-days.

After the spoilage, the remaining flour of 120 kg should be used to determine how many days it will last for the 15 remaining students.

Finally, divide the remaining flour by the new number of students to find out how many days the flour will last: 120 kg / 15 students = 8 days.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **Total flour available:** 150 kg
   - **Number of students initially:** 20
   - **Planned duration:** 30 days

2. **Adjust for Spoilage:**
   - **Flour spoiled:** 30 kg
   - **Useable flour remaining:** 150 kg - 30 kg = **120 kg**

3. **Adjust for Reduced Number of Students:**
   - **Students who left:** 5
   - **Remaining students:** 20 - 5 = **15 students**

4. **Calculate Duration with Remaining Flour:**
   - **Total student-days (initial plan):** 20 students × 30 days = 600 student-days
   - **Flour consumption rate:** 150 kg / 600 student-days = 0.25 kg per student-day
   - **With 120 kg of flour:** 
     - Let \( x \) be the number of days the flour will last.
     - \( 15 \text{ students} \times x \text{ days} = 15x \text{ student-days} \)
     - \( 15x \times 0.25 \text{ kg/student-day} = 120 \text{ kg} \)
     - Solving: \( 3.75x = 120 \) → \( x = 32 \text{ days} \)

Alright, let's try to figure out this math problem. It's about the ages of two trees, a banyan and a pine tree, in a park. The problem gives some information about their ages in the past and asks us to find the sum of their current ages. 

First, I'll try to translate the problem into English to make sure I understand it correctly. 

The problem states: 150 years ago, the sum of the ages of the banyan and pine trees was 2961 years. Now, the pine tree is 1432 years old. We need to find the current sum of the ages of both trees.

Okay, so let's break this down. 

150 years ago, the total age was 2961. That means if we add the ages of both trees 150 years ago, it sums up to 2961. Now, we're told that the pine tree is currently 1432 years old. 

I need to find out how old the banyan tree is now and then add that to the pine tree's age to get the current total.

So, let's denote:
- Let B be the current age of the banyan tree.
- Let P be the current age of the pine tree, which is 1432 years.

150 years ago, the banyan tree's age would have been B - 150, and the pine tree's age would have been P - 150. According to the problem, the sum of their ages at that time was 2961. So, I can set up an equation:

(B - 150) + (P - 150) = 2961

We know P is 1432, so I can substitute that into the equation:

(B - 150) + (1432 - 150) = 2961

Let me compute 1432 - 150 first. 1432 minus 150 is... let's see, 1432 - 100 is 1332, then subtract 50 more, which is 1282. So, 1282.

Now, plug that back into the equation:

B - 150 + 1282 = 2961

Combine the terms on the left side: 

B + (1282 - 150) = 2961

1282 - 150 is 1132. So,

B + 1132 = 2961

To find B, subtract 1132 from both sides:

B = "

To determine how many students are in each row when 2704 students are arranged in a square formation, I start by understanding that a square has an equal number of rows and columns. This means I need to find the square root of the total number of students to identify both the number of rows and the number of students per row.

First, I calculate the square root of 2704. By estimating, I know that 52 squared is 2704 because 50 squared is 2500 and 52 squared is 2704. This confirms that if there are 52 rows, there will also be 52 students in each row.

Therefore, each row contains 52 students.
</think>

Let’s solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Translation:**
In a school, 2704 students are arranged in a square formation for a daily assembly. How many students are there in each row?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Concept:**
   - A square formation means the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.
   - Let’s denote the number of students in each row as \( n \).

2. **Formulate the Equation:**
   - Since the formation is square-shaped, the total number of students \( T \) is given by:
     \[
     T = n^2
     \]
   - Given \( T = 2704 \), we can write:
     \[
     n^2 = 2704
     \]

3. **Solve for \( n \):**
   - To find \( n \), take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     n = \sqrt{2704}
     \]
   - Calculate the square root:
     \[
     n = 52
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Each row contains **52** students.

Okay, so I need to solve this problem: Find the smallest number that, when added to 5320, results in a perfect square. The problem is in Bengali, but I'll tackle it in English. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that a perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer. So, if I have a number x such that x² is the perfect square. My task is to find the smallest x where 5320 + x = n² for some integer n.

So, I need to find the smallest x such that 5320 + x is a perfect square. Alternatively, I can think of it as finding the smallest n where n² is greater than 5320, and then x will be n² - 5320.

Alright, let's start by estimating the square root of 5320 to find the nearest perfect squares around it. 

Calculating the square root of 5320... Hmm, 72² is 5184 because 70² is 4900, 71² is 5041, 72² is 5184, and 73² is 5329. Wait, 73 squared is 5329, which is very close to 5320. That means 5320 is just 9 less than 5329. So, if I add 9 to 5320, I get 5329, which is 73². That seems too straightforward. But let me double-check.

Let me compute 73²: 70² is 4900, plus 3² is 9, and then cross term is 2*70*3=420. So, 73² = 4900 + 420 + 9 = 5329. Yep, that's correct.

So, 5320 + 9 = 5329, which is 73². Therefore, the smallest number to add is 9.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me verify if 9 is indeed the smallest by checking if there's any perfect square between 5320 and 5329. Since 5329 is the next perfect square after 5320, and the difference between them is 9, there's no perfect square between 5320 and 5329 except 5329 itself.

So, no smaller number than 9 added to 5320 will make it a perfect square because the next perfect square is exactly "

First, I need to calculate the simple interest for the given amount. The formula for simple interest is I = P × R × T. Here, the principal P is 5000, the rate R is 10%, and the time T is 3 years. Plugging in these values, the simple interest would be 5000 * 0.10 * 3 = 1500.

Next, I'll calculate the compound interest. Since the interest is compounded annually, I'll use the formula A = P(1 + R/100)^T. With the same principal of 5000 and rate of 10%, the amount after 3 years would be 5000*(1.10)^3, which calculates to 5000*1.331 = 6655. The compound interest is then the difference between the final amount and the principal, so 6655 - 5000 = 1655.

Finally, to find the difference between the two interests, I'll subtract the simple interest from the compound interest: 1655 - 1500 = 155. Therefore, the difference is 155 rupees.
</think>

### Solution:

1. **Translate the Problem:**
   
   The problem reads: ""The difference between the simple interest and compound interest on ৞ 5000 at 10% per annum for 3 years is ___ rupees.""

2. **Calculate Simple Interest:**
   
   The formula for simple interest (SI) is:
   
   \[
   SI = P \times R \times T
   \]
   
   Where:
   - \( P = 5000 \) (Principal)
   - \( R = 10\% = 0.10 \) (Rate of interest)
   - \( T = 3 \) years (Time)
   
   Plugging in the values:
   
   \[
   SI = 5000 \times 0.10 \times 3 = 1500
   \]

3. **Calculate Compound Interest:**
   
   The formula for compound interest (CI) when interest is compounded annually is:
   
   \[
   A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T
   \]
   
   Where:
   - \( A \) is the amount after \( T \) years
   - \( P = 5000 \)
   - \( R = 10\% \)
   - \( T = 3"

First, I need to determine the time it takes for the train to travel from Kamalapur to Narayanganj at 30 km/h.

Let the distance between the stations be \( D \) kilometers.

At a speed of 30 km/h, the time taken to cover the distance is \( \frac{D}{30} \) hours.

If the speed is reduced to 25 km/h, the time taken becomes \( \frac{D}{25} \) hours.

According to the problem, reducing the speed results in 10 additional minutes, which is \( \frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6} \) hours.

Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{D}{25} = \frac{D}{30} + \frac{1}{6}
\]

To solve for \( D \), I'll find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
6D = 30 \times 60 + 25 \times D
\]
Wait, that approach seems off. Let me try solving the equation step-by-step.

Subtract \( \frac{D}{30} \) from both sides:
\[
\frac{D}{25} - \frac{D}{30} = \frac{1}{6}
\]
Find a common denominator for the terms on the left, which is 150:
\[
\frac{6D - 5D}{150} = \frac{1}{6}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{D}{150} = \frac{1}{6}
\]
Multiply both sides by 150 to solve for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{150}{6} = 25
\]

Thus, the distance between the two stations is 25 kilometers.

First, I'll assign variables to the unknowns. Let \( c \) represent the cost of one notebook in Taka and \( p \) represent the cost of one pencil in Taka.

From the first transaction, the boy bought 15 notebooks and 10 pencils for 300 Taka. This gives the equation:
\[ 15c + 10p = 300 \]

From the second transaction, the boy bought 10 notebooks and 15 pencils for 250 Taka. This gives the second equation:
\[ 10c + 15p = 250 \]

To eliminate one variable, I'll multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2. This aligns the coefficients of \( c \) for elimination:
\[ 45c + 30p = 900 \]
\[ 20c + 30p = 500 \]

Subtracting the second new equation from the first:
\[ 45c + 30p - (20c + 30p) = 900 - 500 \]
\[ 25c = 400 \]
\[ c = 16 \]

Now, substituting \( c = 16 \) back into the first original equation to find \( p \):
\[ 15(16) + 10p = 300 \]
\[ 240 + 10p = 300 \]
\[ 10p = 60 \]
\[ p = 6 \]

Thus, the cost of each pencil is 6 Taka.

To solve the problem, I need to divide 4/5 liters of sharbat equally between 2 people.

First, I'll divide the total amount by the number of people. This involves dividing 4/5 by 2.

To divide a fraction by a whole number, I'll multiply the fraction by the reciprocal of the number. So, 4/5 divided by 2 becomes (4/5) multiplied by (1/2), which equals 4/10 or 2/5 liters.

Therefore, each person will receive 2/5 liters of sharbat.
</think>

**Problem Translation:**  
4/5 liters of sharbat is divided equally between 2 people. How many liters of sharbat will each person receive?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**  
   We have \( \frac{4}{5} \) liters of sharbat that needs to be divided equally between 2 people. We need to find out how much sharbat each person gets.

2. **Set Up the Division:**  
   To divide \( \frac{4}{5} \) liters equally between 2 people, we can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \div 2
   \]

3. **Dividing a Fraction by a Whole Number:**  
   Dividing a fraction by a whole number is the same as multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the whole number. The reciprocal of 2 is \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4 \times 1}{5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{10}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Fraction:**  
   Simplify \( \frac{4}{10} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
   \[
   \frac{4 \div 2}{10 \div 2} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**  
   Each person will receive \( \frac{2}{5} \) liters of sharbat.

First, I need to understand the problem. The total cost to carpet the floor of a room is ₹7,200. If the width of the room were 3 meters less, the cost would have been ₹576 less.

I'll denote the original width as w and the length as l. The area of the floor is w multiplied by l.

The original cost is ₹7,200, so the cost per square meter is ₹7,200 divided by the area, which is 7200/(w*l).

With the reduced width, the new width is w-3, and the new area is (w-3)*l. The new cost is ₹7,200 - ₹576 = ₹6,624.

Setting up the equation for the new cost, I get 7200/(w*l) = 6624/((w-3)*l).

By canceling l from both sides, the equation simplifies to 7200/(w) = 6624/(w-3).

Cross-multiplying gives 7200*(w-3) = 6624*w.

Expanding and simplifying, I find 7200w - 21,600 = 6,624w.

Subtracting 6,624w from both sides gives 1,576w = 21,600.

Finally, solving for w gives w = 21,600 / 1,576 ≈ 13.71 meters.

Thus, the original width of the room is approximately 13.71 meters.
</think>

**Translated Problem:**
The total cost to carpet the floor of a room is ₹7,200. If the width of the room were 3 meters less, the cost would have been ₹576 less. What is the width of the room in meters?

**Solution:**

Let's denote:
- \( w \) = original width of the room (in meters)
- \( l \) = length of the room (in meters)

The area of the room is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = w \times l

The cost to carpet the floor is directly proportional to the area. Given:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = ₹7,200
\]
So, the cost per square meter (\( C \)) is:
\[
C = \frac{7200}{w \times l}

Let’s solve the problem step by step.

First, let's identify the data given:

- Interest for 3 years (I₁) = ১৫৭৮ টাকা (Tk 1578)
- Interest for 5 years (I₂) = ১৮৩০ টাকা (Tk 1830)

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the interest for 5 years should be more than for 3 years, which is true here (1830 > 1578). However, there might be a miscalculation since the interest for 5 years seems too close to 3 years.

But assuming the data is correct, the formula for simple interest is:

\[ I = P \times R \times T \]

Where:
- I = Interest
- P = Principal
- R = Rate of interest (in decimal)
- T = Time in years

Let’s denote the principal as \( P \) and the rate of interest as \( R \).

For 3 years:
\[ 1578 = P \times R \times 3 \]
\[ PR = \frac{1578}{3} = 526 \]

For 5 years:
\[ 1830 = P \times R \times 5 \]
\[ PR = \frac{1830}{5} = 366 \]

Wait, this is inconsistent. The PR product cannot have two different values (526 and 366). This suggests that either the data provided is incorrect or the problem is misinterpreted.

If it's a simple interest problem, then the interest should increase proportionally with time. For 5 years, the interest should indeed be more than for 3 years, which is the case. However, the way the interest is provided might not align with simple interest unless the principal and rate are adjusted accordingly.

Perhaps there's a different type of interest involved, or maybe the problem needs to be interpreted differently. Given the confusion, it's best to reconsider the approach or check if there's additional information or context needed.

Alright, let me try to solve this problem. So, we have a rectangle, right? The base is 40 meters and the height is 50 meters. Hmm, wait, sometimes in Bangla, ""base"" is called ""bhumi"" and ""height"" is ""ucchata"". So, I need to make sure I'm translating those correctly. Okay, so a rectangle's area is usually calculated by multiplying the base by the height. I think that's right because the formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = length × width. In this case, the base is 40 meters, so that should be one side, and the height is 50 meters, which would be the adjacent side. So, I just need to multiply 40 by 50 to get the area in square meters. Let me do that calculation... 40 times 50 is 2000. Yeah, that seems about right. I don't think I'm missing anything here. It's a straightforward multiplication. So, the area should be 2000 square meters.
</think>

The problem asks for the area of a rectangle with a base of 40 meters and a height of 50 meters.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to find the area of a rectangle when the base (bhumi) and height (ucchata) are given.

2. **Recall the Formula:** The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length (base) by its width (height). The formula is:  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height}

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**  
   Base = 40 meters  
   Height = 50 meters  
   So,  
   \[
   \text{Area} = 40\, \text{m} \times 50\, \text{m} = 2000\, \text{m}^2

First, let's translate the problem into English to clarify the scenario. The problem states that today, my grandmother made a lot of pickles. She filled 4/7 of the pickles into glass jars and stored them. The remaining portion was equally divided among the 6 family members.

Next, to find out how much each person received, I'll calculate the remaining pickles after setting aside 4/7. This is done by subtracting 4/7 from the whole, which is 1. So, 1 - 4/7 equals 3/7. This means that 3/7 of the total pickles are left to be divided.

Now, I'll divide this 3/7 equally among the 6 people. Dividing by 6 is the same as multiplying by 1/6. Therefore, 3/7 multiplied by 1/6 equals 3/42, which simplifies to 1/14.

So, each person received 1/14 of the total pickles.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Total Pickles Considered as 1 Unit:**
   - Let the total amount of pickles be represented by 1.

2. **Portion Stored in Jars:**
   - Grandmother stored \(\frac{4}{7}\) of the pickles in jars.
   - Therefore, the remaining pickles to be distributed are:
     \[
     1 - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{7}{7} - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{3}{7}
     \]

3. **Distributing the Remaining Pickles:**
   - The remaining \(\frac{3}{7}\) of the pickles are to be divided equally among 6 people.
   - Each person's share is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{3}{7} \div 6 = \frac{3}{7} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{42} = \frac{1}{14}

First, understanding the problem correctly is key. I need to arrange these four digits—6, 4, 8, 2—each used once, to create two numbers: one the biggest possible and the other the smallest possible. After that, subtract the smaller number from the larger one to get the difference. Sounds straightforward, but I should think carefully to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

Starting with the largest number. To form the largest possible number with given digits, the strategy is to place the largest digits first. So, arranging them in descending order usually gives the biggest number. Let's list the digits: 8, 6, 4, 2. So, putting them together would give 8642. That seems to make sense because 8 is the largest digit, followed by 6, then 4, and the smallest digit 2 at the end. So, 8642 should be the largest number possible.

Now, for the smallest number. The approach here is the opposite—placing the smallest digits first. But wait, it's not just about the digits; we also need to form the smallest possible number, which usually means starting with the smallest non-zero digit. The digits available are 2, 4, 6, 8. So, the smallest first digit should be 2. Then, to keep the number as small as possible, we should follow with the next smallest digits. So, after 2, the next digit should be 4, then 6, and finally 8. That would give us 2468. That seems right because each subsequent digit is the next smallest available, ensuring the overall number is minimized.

Wait a second, is there a way to make the smaller number even smaller with a different arrangement? Let me think. If I try putting 2 in the thousands place, but then in the hundreds place, maybe using an even smaller digit. But since 2 is the smallest, followed by 4, 6, and 8, I don't think rearranging the digits after 2 will result in a smaller number. For example, 2648 is larger than 246"

Alright, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me first read and understand it properly. The problem is about a swimming pool holding 8000 liters of water. The pool has a length of 2.56 meters and a width of 1.25 meters, and I need to find out its depth in meters.

Okay, swimming pools are usually rectangular in shape, so I can assume this is a rectangular prism. I remember that the volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, the height would be the depth of the water in the pool.

The formula for volume (V) is:
V = length × width × depth

I have the volume as 8000 liters, but I know that in metric units, 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters. So, I should convert the volume from liters to cubic meters to make the units consistent.

Let me do that conversion first:
8000 liters ÷ 1000 = 8 cubic meters

Now, I can plug the values into the formula. I know the volume is 8 m³, the length is 2.56 m, and the width is 1.25 m. I need to solve for depth (let's call it 'd').

So, rearranging the formula to solve for depth:
d = V / (length × width)

Plugging in the numbers:
d = 8 / (2.56 × 1.25)

First, I will calculate the denominator by multiplying 2.56 and 1.25. Let me do the multiplication:

2.56 × 1.25

Hmm, calculating this step by step. Since 1.25 is the same as 5/4, multiplying by 5/4 might be easier.

2.56 × 5 = 12.8
Then, divide by 4:
12.8 ÷ 4 = 3.2

So, the denominator is 3.2.

Now, divide the volume by this result:
8 ÷ 3.2

Let me think about this division. 3.2 goes into 8 how many times?

Well, 3.2 × 2 = 6.4
Subtract 6.4 from 8, which leaves 1.6.

3.2 goes into 1.6 exactly 0.5 times because 3.2 × 0.5 = "

I need to find the smallest number that is divisible by 18, 24, and 42.

First, I'll find the prime factors of each number:
18 = 2 × 3²
24 = 2³ × 3
42 = 2 × 3 × 7

Next, I'll determine the highest powers of all prime factors:
The highest power of 2 is 2³ from 24.
The highest power of 3 is 3² from 18.
The highest power of 7 is 7¹ from 42.

Now, I'll multiply these highest powers together to find the least common multiple (LCM):
LCM = 2³ × 3² × 7 = 8 × 9 × 7 = 504

So, 504 is the smallest number that is divisible by 18, 24, and 42.

**Problem Translation:**  
The smallest number divisible by 18, 24, and 42 is ______.

---

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the smallest number divisible by 18, 24, and 42, we need to determine the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of these numbers.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - **18:**  
     \(18 = 2 \times 9 = 2 \times 3^2\)  
     So, prime factors of 18 are \(2\) and \(3^2\).

   - **24:**  
     \(24 = 2 \times 12 = 2 \times 2 \times 6 = 2^3 \times 3\)  
     So, prime factors of 24 are \(2^3\) and \(3\).

   - **42:**  
     \(42 = 2 \times 21 = 2 \times 3 \times 7\)  
     So, prime factors of 42 are \(2\), \(3\), and \(7\).

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of All Prime Factors:**
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 24).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^2\) (from 18).
   - For \(7\): The highest power is \(7^1\) (from 42).

Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the price of one plate when we know the total cost for 12 plates and 20 cups, along with the price of one cup. 

First, let's break down what we know. The total cost for 12 plates and 20 cups is 3920 taka. Each cup costs 145 taka. So, if I can find out how much all the cups cost together, I can subtract that from the total to find out the cost of the plates, and then find the price per plate.

Let me write down the information so I don't get confused. Total for plates and cups: 3920. Number of plates: 12. Number of cups: 20. Price per cup: 145.

So, total cost for cups would be number of cups multiplied by price per cup. That's 20 cups * 145 taka each. Let me calculate that. 20 times 100 is 2000, and 20 times 45 is 900, so 2000 + 900 equals 2900. So, the cups cost 2900 taka together.

Now, subtract that from the total to get the cost for the plates. 3920 total minus 2900 for cups leaves 1020 taka for the plates. That makes sense because 3900 minus 2900 is 1000, and then there's an extra 20, so 1020.

Now, since there are 12 plates, to find the price per plate, I divide the total cost for plates by the number of plates. So, 1020 divided by 12. Hmm, let's do this division step by step. 12 times 80 is 960, which is less than 1020. So, 1020 minus 960 is 60 left. 12 goes into 60 exactly 5 times because 12*5=60. So, 80 plus 5 equals 85. So, each plate costs 85 taka.

Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If each plate is 85 taka, 12 plates would be 12*85. Let me compute that: 10*85=850 and 2*85=170, so total is 850+170=1020. Then, adding the cups cost 2900, so 1020+2900="

First, I need to understand the problem. We are given the number 4639, and we need to find the smallest number that, when subtracted from 4639, results in a perfect square.

To approach this, I'll start by recalling that a perfect square is an integer multiplied by itself, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. My goal is to find the smallest possible value of x such that 4639 minus x equals one of these perfect squares.

I'll begin by estimating the square root of 4639 to identify nearby perfect squares. Calculating the square root of 4639 gives approximately 68.15. This means the perfect squares around 4639 are likely 68² and 69².

Calculating these:
- 68 squared is 4624.
- 69 squared is 4761.

Now, I'll compare these to our target number, 4639:
1. Subtracting 4624 from 4639 gives 15. So, if x is 15, then 4639 - 15 equals 4624, which is a perfect square.
2. Subtracting 4761 from 4639 results in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context since we're looking for a positive x.

Therefore, the smallest number to subtract is 15.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Translation:**  
From 4639, if we subtract a certain smallest number, the result is a perfect square number. What is that number?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**  
   We are given the number 4639 and need to find the smallest number \( x \) such that:
   \[
   4639 - x = n^2
   \]
   where \( n^2 \) is a perfect square.

2. **Find Perfect Squares Near 4639:**  
   First, identify the perfect squares close to 4639.  
   Calculate the square root of 4639:
   \[
   n = \sqrt{4639} \approx 68.15
   \]
   So, the nearest perfect squares are:
   \[
   68^2 = 4624 \quad \text{and} \quad 69^2 = 4761
   \]

First, I need to determine how much work Habiba and Halima can do together in one day. Since they can complete the entire job in 20 days, their combined work rate is 1/20 of the job per day.

Next, they worked together for 8 days, so the amount of work they completed together is 8 times their combined work rate, which is 8/20 or 2/5 of the job.

This means that the remaining work left for Halima to complete is 1 minus 2/5, which is 3/5 of the job.

Halima completes the remaining 3/5 of the work in 21 days. To find her individual work rate, I divide the remaining work by the time taken: (3/5) / 21, which simplifies to 1/35 of the job per day.

Since Halima can complete 1/35 of the work in one day, the total time she would take to complete the entire job alone is the reciprocal of her work rate, which is 35 days.

**Translation of the Problem:**
Habiba and Halima together can complete a work in 20 days. Habiba and Halima worked together for 8 days, after which Habiba left. Halima completed the remaining work in 21 days. The entire work Halima ________ days to complete.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Combined Work Rate:**
   - Together, Habiba and Halima can complete the work in 20 days.
   - Therefore, their combined work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Combined Rate} = \frac{1 \text{ work}}{20 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ work/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate Work Completed Together:**
   - They worked together for 8 days.
   - Work completed together:
     \[
     \text{Work Done Together} = 8 \text{ days} \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ work/day} = \frac{8}{20} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ work}
     \]

3. **Determine Remaining Work:**
   - Total work = 1
   - Remaining work:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Work} = 1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}"

First, I need to convert all the dimensions of the box to meters to ensure consistency in units.

The length is already given as 2 meters.

Next, the width is 1 meter and 50 centimeters. Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, 50 centimeters is 0.5 meters. Therefore, the width is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 meters.

The height is given as 1 meter.

Now, to calculate the volume of the box, I will multiply the length, width, and height together.

So, the volume is 2 meters × 1.5 meters × 1 meter.

First, I need to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it. Let me read through the problem again and identify the key pieces of information provided.

The problem describes a rectangular tank with specific dimensions and a solid metal cube placed inside it. After filling the tank with water and then removing the cube, I need to determine the new water depth. 

Here's the information given:

- Dimensions of the tank:
  - Length = 3 meters
  - Width = 2 meters
  - Height = 1 meter

- Size of the cube:
  - Side length = 50 centimeters = 0.5 meters (since 1 meter = 100 centimeters)

My objective is to find the change in water level when the cube is removed from the tank. 

I recall that when an object is submerged in water, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume. In this case, the cube is submerged when the tank is filled with water, so the volume of the cube is equal to the volume of water displaced.

So, to find the new water depth after removing the cube, I can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial volume of water plus the cube:**
   Since the tank is filled with water to the brim, the initial total volume is the volume of the tank.

   Volume of the tank = length × width × height = 3 m × 2 m × 1 m = 6 cubic meters.

   However, this volume includes both the water and the submerged cube. Therefore, the actual volume of water is the volume of the tank minus the volume of the cube.

2. **Calculate the volume of water alone:**
   First, I need to find the volume of the cube.

   Volume of cube = side³ = (0.5 m)³ = 0.125 cubic meters.

   Therefore, the volume of water alone is:

   Volume of water = Volume of tank - Volume of cube = 6 m³ - 0.125 m³ = 5.875 m³.

3. **Determine the new water depth after removing the cube:**
   After removing the cube, the water level will decrease because the displaced volume by the cube is no longer present.

   The new volume of water will be 5.875 m³. To find the new depth, I can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular tank:

   Volume = length × width × depth

Let's solve the problem step by step.

We need to find the smallest natural number that, when multiplied by 162, results in a perfect square.

First, let's prime factorize 162.
162 can be divided by 2, giving 81. 81 is 9 times 9, which is \(3^2\) each. So,
\(162 = 2 \times 3^4\).

For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even numbers.

Looking at the prime factors of 162:
- The exponent of 2 is 1, which is odd.
- The exponent of 3 is 4, which is even.

To make all exponents even, we need to multiply by another 2 to make the exponent of 2 equal to 2.

Therefore, the smallest natural number to multiply 162 to get a perfect square is 2.

Let's verify:
\(162 \times 2 = 324\).
Checking if 324 is a perfect square:
\(\sqrt{324} = 18\), which is an integer. So, it's correct.

The smallest natural number required is 2.
</think>

**Problem Translation:** What is the smallest natural number such that when it is multiplied by 162, the result is a perfect square?

**Solution:**

To find the smallest natural number \( x \) such that \( 162 \times x \) is a perfect square, we can follow these steps:

1. **Prime Factorization of 162:**
   Begin by expressing 162 in its prime factors.
   \[
   162 = 2 \times 81 = 2 \times 9 \times 9 = 2 \times 3^4
   \]
   So, \( 162 = 2^1 \times 3^4 \).

2. **Condition for a Perfect Square:**
   A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even numbers.

3. **Identify the Required Factors:**
   - The exponent of 2 in 162 is 1, which is odd. To make it even, we need to multiply by another 2.
   - The exponent of 3 in 162 is 4, which is already even.

4. **Determine the Smallest \( x \):**
   The smallest \( x \) would be the product of the primes needed to"

First, I identify the key information provided in the problem. The radius of the circular garden is 21 meters, and the gardener wants to wrap the rope around the garden two times. The cost of the rope is 18 Tk per meter.

Next, I calculate the circumference of the garden using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is 2 * π * r. Substituting the given radius, the circumference is 2 * 3.1416 * 21, which equals approximately 131.946 meters.

Since the gardener needs to wrap the rope twice around the garden, I multiply the circumference by 2 to find the total length of the rope required. This gives 131.946 * 2 = 263.892 meters.

Finally, to determine the total cost of the rope, I multiply the total length of the rope by the cost per meter. Therefore, 263.892 meters * 18 Tk/m equals approximately 4,750.00 Tk.

1. **Translate the Problem:**
   
   A gardener wants to wrap a rope fence around a circular garden with a radius of 21 meters two times. The cost of the rope is 18 Tk per meter. How many Tk worth of rope does he need to buy?

2. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   - **Calculate the Circumference of the Circular Garden:**
     
     The formula for the circumference (\(C\)) of a circle is:
     \[
     C = 2 \times \pi \times r
     \]
     Given the radius (\(r\)) is 21 meters and taking \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
     \[
     C = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 21 \approx 131.946 \text{ meters}
     \]

   - **Determine the Total Length of Rope Needed:**
     
     Since the gardener wants to wrap the rope two times around the garden:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = 2 \times \text{Circumference} = 2 \times 131.946 \approx 263.892 \text{ meters}

Alright, so I've got this problem here about Sufiqul Chacha from Atla village. He's trying to plant 780 saplings in his land, and he has a specific way he wants to arrange them. The problem is that when he tries to plant them in this special arrangement, he ends up short by 4 saplings. I need to figure out how many rows he intended to plant them in.

Okay, let's break this down. The key points are:

1. Total saplings: 780.
2. He wants each row to have the same number of saplings as the number of rows. So if there are n rows, each row will have n saplings.
3. When he tried planting them this way, he was short by 4 saplings. So instead of needing 780, he only needed 780 - 4 = 776 saplings to fill all the rows completely.

So, the main equation is: n × n = n², which should be equal to 776 because that's how many he actually planted. But wait, no, actually, he tried to plant 780 saplings, thinking that each row would have n saplings, but he came up 4 short. That means that when he tried planting 780 saplings in n rows, each row having n saplings, he needed 4 more to complete the last row. So the total number of saplings needed would be n² = 780 + 4 = 784.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if he plants 780, he's 4 short, so the total number of saplings he actually needs is 784, which is a perfect square. So, n² = 784, which means n = √784. Let me calculate that.

What's the square root of 784? Hmm, I know that 28² is 784 because 25² is 625, 26² is 676, 27² is 729, and 28² is 784. So, n = 28. That means he intended to plant the saplings in 28 rows, each containing 28 saplings. But when he tried, he only had 780, which is 4 less than 784. So, that fits the problem statement.

To make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me double-check:

If n = 28, then the total saplings needed are 28 × 28 = 784"

First, let's understand the given information. It takes \( \frac{1}{3} \) deciliters (dL) of paint to paint \( \frac{3}{5} \) square meters (m²) of wall.

We need to find out how many square meters can be painted with 1 deciliter of paint. This is essentially finding the painting capacity of 1 dL of paint.

To do this, we'll establish a proportion based on the given rates. Let \( x \) be the number of square meters that can be painted with 1 dL of paint. 

The proportion can be set up as:
\[
\frac{\frac{3}{5} \text{ m}²}{\frac{1}{3} \text{ dL}} = \frac{x \text{ m}²}{1 \text{ dL}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
x = \frac{3}{5} \times 3 = \frac{9}{5}
\]

Therefore, with 1 deciliter of paint, you can paint \( 1\frac{4}{5} \) square meters of wall.

To solve the problem, I first note that the product of the two positive numbers is 147, and the larger number is three times the smaller one.

Let’s denote the smaller number as \( x \). Therefore, the larger number can be expressed as \( 3x \).

Setting up the equation based on the product, I have:
\[ x \times 3x = 147 \]
\[ 3x^2 = 147 \]

To find the value of \( x \), I divide both sides by 3:
\[ x^2 = 49 \]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[ x = 7 \]

Now, since the larger number is three times the smaller number:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
</think>

**Problem Translation:**
Two positive numbers have a product of 147, and the larger number is three times the smaller one. The larger number is ______.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the smaller number be \( x \).
   - Since the larger number is three times the smaller one, the larger number is \( 3x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The product of the two numbers is given as 147:
     \[
     x \times 3x = 147
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     3x^2 = 147
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{147}{3} = 49
     \]
   - Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     x = \sqrt{49} = 7
     \]

4. **Find the Larger Number:**
   - Substitute \( x = 7 \) into \( 3x \):
     \[
     3x = 3 \times 7 = 21
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The larger number is **21**.

First, I need to determine how many boxes are required to store 500 pencils when each box can hold 12 pencils.

To find this, I'll divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can contain.

So, 500 pencils divided by 12 pencils per box equals approximately 41.666... boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, I'll round up to ensure all pencils fit.

Therefore, 42 boxes are needed.
</think>

**Translated Problem:**  
We have 500 pencils. If we place 12 pencils in each box, how many boxes will be needed?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**  
   We need to find out how many boxes are required to store 500 pencils when each box can hold 12 pencils.

2. **Formulate the Equation:**  
   To find the number of boxes, divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold.

   \[
   \text{Number of Boxes} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Pencils}}{\text{Pencils per Box}}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Number of Boxes} = \frac{500}{12}
   \]

3. **Perform the Division:**  
   Calculate \( \frac{500}{12} \):

   \[
   \frac{500}{12} = 41.\overline{6}
   \]

   This means it would take 41 full boxes to hold 500 pencils, but there would still be \( 0.\overline{6} \times 12 = 8 \) pencils left over.

4. **Determine the Additional Box:**  
   Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number to accommodate the remaining pencils.

   \[
   41 + 1 = 42
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Therefore, 42 boxes are needed to store all 500 pencils.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: ""A board's 3/4 square meters can be colored with 1 deci liter of paint. Then, it asks how many square meters can be colored with 4 deci liters of paint.""

Alright, so the first thing I notice is that it's a proportion problem. The more paint you have, the more area you can cover. So, the key here is to find out the rate at which the paint is used per square meter.

Let me write down what I know:
- 3/4 square meters requires 1 deci liter of paint.
- We need to find out how much area (let's call it x) can be covered with 4 deci liters.

So, if 3/4 m² uses 1 dL, then how much does 1 dL cover? Oh, wait, that's directly given: 1 dL covers 3/4 m². Wait, no, actually, 1 dL can color 3/4 m². So, that means that per deci liter, it's 3/4 m².

Now, we have 4 times as much paint as the initial amount. So, if 1 dL does 3/4 m², then 4 dL would do 4 times that amount.

Let me calculate that. 4 multiplied by 3/4. Hmm, 4 times 3 is 12, and the denominator remains 4, so 12/4 is 3.

So, that means 4 deci liters can color 3 square meters.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1 dL = 3/4 m². So, 4 dL = 4 * (3/4) m².

Calculating 4 * (3/4):

The 4 in the numerator and the 4 in the denominator will cancel each other out, leaving just 3 m².

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 3 square meters.

I think that's all. It seems straightforward once I set up the proportion correctly.
</think>

To solve the problem, we determine the area that can be painted with 4 deci liters of paint by using the given rate of 1"

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the Initial Number of Animals**
- Number of goats (G) initially = 50
- Number of cows (C) initially = 60

**Step 2: Calculate New Calves Born in One Year**
- Each cow gives birth to 2 calves per year.
- Total calves born = Number of cows × Number of calves per cow = 60 × 2 = 120

**Step 3: Account for Mortality Rate of Calves**
- Mortality rate of calves = 30% or 0.30
- Number of calves that die = Total calves born × Mortality rate = 120 × 0.30 = 36
- Surviving calves = Total calves born - Calves that die = 120 - 36 = 84

**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Cows After One Year**
- The number of cows increases by the number of surviving calves.
- Total cows after one year = Initial cows + Surviving calves = 60 + 84 = 144

**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Animals After One Year**
- Number of goats remains unchanged as there is no information about their reproduction or mortality.
- Total animals after one year = Total cows after one year + Initial goats = 144 + 50 = 194

Final Answer: 194

First, I need to understand the relationships and shares of the brothers based on the given fractions and multiples.

Let’s denote Lincoln's share as L. According to the problem, Dalim receives twice as much as Lincoln, so Dalim's share is 2L.

Sabuj receives 3/5 of Dalim's share. Therefore, Sabuj's share is (3/5)*2L, which simplifies to (6/5)L.

The total amount of money to be divided among the three brothers is Rs. 6,300. So, the sum of their shares is:
Sabuj + Dalim + Lincoln = (6/5)L + 2L + L = 6,300.

Combining the terms:
(6/5)L + 3L = 6,300.

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 5:
6L + 15L = 31,500
21L = 31,500

Solving for L:
L = 1,500.

Therefore, Lincoln's share amounts to Rs. 1,500.

I recall that a perfect square has even exponents in its prime factorization. Breaking down 7, it is already a prime number, so its factorization is simply 7.

To make \( 7 \times n \) a perfect square, \( n \) must include another factor of 7. This way, the exponent of 7 in the product becomes 2, which is even.

Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition is 7.

### Translation:
We need to find the smallest positive integer with which when multiplied by 7, the product is a perfect square. The number is ____.

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to identify the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 7 \times n \) results in a perfect square.

1. **Understanding Perfect Squares:**
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as \( k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer.
   - In terms of prime factorization, perfect squares have even exponents for all prime factors.

2. **Analyzing the Number 7:**
   - The number 7 is a prime number.
   - Its prime factorization is \( 7^1 \).

3. **Determining the Required Factor \( n \):**
   - For \( 7 \times n \) to be a perfect square, the combined exponent of 7 in the prime factorization must be even.
   - Since 7 currently has an exponent of 1, \( n \) must contribute an additional factor of 7 to make the exponent 2.

4. **Calculating \( n \):**
   - Therefore, \( n = 7 \).

Next, to find out the production over three weeks, I multiply the daily production by the number of weeks. That is, 360 bicycles/day multiplied by 21 days, which gives a total of 7,560 bicycles.

Therefore, the factory will produce 7,560 bicycles in three weeks.
</think>

**Translated Problem:**
A factory manufactures 2,520 bicycles in 7 days. How many bicycles will be produced in the same factory in 3 weeks?

---

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Production Rate Per Day:**
   - The factory produces 2,520 bicycles in 7 days.
   - To find the production per day, divide the total production by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Production per day} = \frac{2,520 \text{ bicycles}}{7 \text{ days}} = 360 \text{ bicycles/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Days in 3 Weeks:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the number of weeks by 7:
     \[
     \text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Compute the Total Production in 3 Weeks:**
   - Multiply the daily production rate by the total number of days:
     \[
     \text{Total production} = 360 \text{ bicycles/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 7,560 \text{ bicycles}

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

**Understanding the Problem:**
We have 1,800 seedlings to be planted in a square pattern. However, after planting, there are 36 extra seedlings. We need to find out how many seedlings are in each row.

**Formulating the Equation:**
Let’s assume that each row has \( x \) number of seedlings.

Normally, if the seedlings fit perfectly into a square, the equation would be:
\[ x^2 = 1800 \]
However, since there are 36 extra seedlings, the total number planted is:
\[ x^2 = 1800 + 36 = 1836 \]

**Solving for \( x \):**
To find \( x \), we take the square root of both sides:
\[ x = \sqrt{1836} \]
Calculating the square root:
\[ x \approx 42.855 \]

Since the number of seedlings must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 42.

**Verification:**
Plating 42 seedlings per row results in:
\[ 42^2 = 1764 \]
Since we have 1,800 seedlings initially, the number of extra seedlings is:
\[ 1800 - 1764 = 36 \]
This matches the given condition of having 36 extra seedlings.

**Conclusion:**
The number of seedlings per row is 42.

Alright, so I have this math problem here about workers building a dam by the Ichhamati river. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Okay, the problem says that 40 workers take 35 days to build a certain part of the dam. Now, they're asking how many workers would be needed to finish the same job in 28 days instead. Hmm, so I guess this has to do with man-days, which is a way to measure how much work is done based on the number of workers and the time they take.

First, I remember that work problems often involve the concept of man-days, where you multiply the number of workers by the number of days they work to get the total amount of work done. So, in this case, the total work would be 40 workers times 35 days, which equals 1400 man-days. That makes sense because each worker contributes one man-day per day, so 40 workers over 35 days would give 1400 man-days of work.

Now, the question is, if we want this same amount of work done in fewer days—specifically 28 days—how many workers do we need? Since the total work required is still the same (1400 man-days), we can set up an equation where the number of workers multiplied by 28 days equals 1400. So, if I let x be the number of workers needed, then x times 28 should equal 1400.

Mathematically, that's x * 28 = 1400. To find x, I just divide both sides by 28. So, x equals 1400 divided by 28. Let me do that division... 1400 divided by 28. Hmm, 28 times 50 is 1400, right? Because 28 times 50 is 1400. So, x is 50.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure. If 40 workers take 35 days, the total work is 1400 man-days. Then, to finish it in 28 days, we'd need more workers, which makes sense because we're reducing the time. 50 workers times 28 days equals 1400 man-days, which matches the total work needed. Yep, that checks out.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. It's a direct proportion problem. More workers mean less time, and fewer workers mean more time, but the total man-days remain constant. So"

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about percentages and proportions, right? We're told that in our class, 0.23 of the total students are female. The question is asking for the equivalent percentage that represents.

Okay, so first, I remember that when you have a decimal like 0.23, converting it to a percentage involves multiplying by 100. That makes sense because percent means per hundred. So, if 0.23 is the fraction, then 0.23 times 100 should give me the percentage.

Let me do the math. 0.23 multiplied by 100 is 23. So, does that mean 23% of the students are female? That seems straightforward. But wait, is it correct to just multiply by 100? Because percentages are just another way of expressing proportions, scaling them up by a factor of 100.

Let me think. If I have 23 girls out of 100 students, that's 23%. But here, it's 0.23 of the total, which is the same as saying 23 per 100, hence 23%. So yes, I think that's right.

Is there any chance I'm missing something? Let me consider. The problem states ""আমাদের শ্রেণিতে মোট ছাত্রছাত্রীর ০.২৩ অংশ ছাত্রী আছে."" which translates to 0.23 of the total students are female. So, proportionally, that's the same as 23%. 

Wait, could the question be asking for something else, like the number of male students? But no, it specifically asks for the percentage of female students. So I think I'm on the right track.

Another point: sometimes percentages can be tricky when dealing with different totals, but in this case, it's a straightforward proportion. The total number of students isn't provided, but since it's a proportion, we don't need the exact number to find the percentage.

So, to sum it up: 0.23 as a decimal is 23%. Therefore, the answer should be 23%.
</think>

To convert the decimal proportion of female students (0.23) to a percentage, multiply the decimal by 100.

### Translation:
A right circular cylinder with a radius of 5.5 cm has a height of 8 cm. Determine the total surface area of the cylinder in square centimeters. (π = 3.14)

### Solution:

1. **Understand the Formula for Total Surface Area of a Cylinder:**
   The total surface area (TSA) of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{TSA} = 2\pi r (r + h)
   \]
   where:
   - \( r \) is the radius,
   - \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Radius (\( r \)) = 5.5 cm
   - Height (\( h \)) = 8 cm
   - \( \pi = 3.14 \)

3. **Calculate the Total Surface Area:**
   - **Curved Surface Area (CSA):** This is the area of the side of the cylinder without the top and bottom circles.
     \[
     \text{CSA} = 2\pi r h
     \]
   - **Area of the Two Circular Bases:** Each circle has an area of \( \pi r^2 \), so two circles have an area of \( 2\pi r^2 \).
   - **Total Surface Area (TSA):** This is the sum of the curved surface area and the area of the two bases.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I understand that the length is 25 meters more than the width. So, if I let W be the width, then the length L can be expressed as L = W + 25.

Next, the problem tells me that the perimeter of the rectangular field is 150 meters. I remember that the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). Using the expressions I have for length and width, I can set up the equation: 2*(L + W) = 150.

Substituting L with W + 25 in the equation, it becomes 2*((W + 25) + W) = 150, which simplifies to 2*(2W + 25) = 150. Dividing both sides by 2 gives me 2W + 25 = 75. Subtracting 25 from both sides then gives 2W = 50, and dividing both sides by 2, I find that W equals 25 meters.

Now that I know the width is 25 meters, I can find the length by adding 25 meters to the width. So, L = 25 + 25 = 50 meters.
</think>

**Problem translation:**
A rectangular field has a length that is 25 meters more than its width. The perimeter of the rectangular field is 150 meters. What is the length of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( W \) represent the width of the field (in meters).
   - According to the problem, the length \( L \) is \( 25 \) meters more than the width:
     \[
     L = W + 25
     \]

2. **Perimeter of a Rectangle:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (L + W)
     \]
   - Given that the perimeter \( P \) is \( 150 \) meters:
     \[
     2 \times (L + W) = 150
     \]

3. **Substitute \( L \) from Step 1 into the Perimeter Equation:**
   \[
   2 \times ( (W + 25) + W ) = 150

Alright, so I have this math problem to solve. It's about numbers from 1 to 10, and I need to find out what fraction of these numbers are prime numbers. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should make sure I understand the problem correctly. The question is asking for the proportion of prime numbers within the set of integers from 1 to 10. So, I need to figure out two things: the total number of integers in this range, and how many of those are prime numbers.

Alright, the range is from 1 to 10 inclusive. That means the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Let me count them to make sure. Starting at 1 and ending at 10, that's 10 numbers in total.

Next, I need to identify which of these numbers are prime. Remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I need to check each number in the list and see if it's prime.

Starting with 1. Wait, 1 is a bit tricky because, by definition, a prime number has to have exactly two distinct positive divisors. Since 1 only has one divisor, it's not considered a prime number. So, 1 is out.

Moving on to 2. This is the smallest prime number. Why? Because its only divisors are 1 and 2. So, 2 is prime.

Next is 3. Let's check its divisors. The divisors of 3 are 1 and 3. No other numbers can divide into 3 evenly besides these, so 3 is also prime.

Now, 4. Hmm, 4 can be divided by 1, 2, and 4. Since 2 is a divisor other than 1 and 4, 4 is not a prime number.

5 comes next. Checking its divisors: 1 and 5. That means 5 is prime.

6 is up now. 6 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, and 6. So, it has divisors other than 1 and itself, meaning it's not prime.

7 is next. Let's see, 7 divided by 1 is 7, and 7 divided by 7"

First, I need to calculate the interest earned on the fixed deposit. The principal amount is ₹200,000, the annual interest rate is 12%, and the time period is 6 months.

Since the interest is compounded quarterly (six-monthly), I'll use the compound interest formula. The quarterly interest rate is half of the annual rate, which is 6%. 

Using the compound interest formula:
Amount = Principal × (1 + Rate/100)^(Number of Periods)
Here, the amount after 6 months is calculated by applying the quarterly rate once.

So, the interest earned is ₹12,000.

First, I need to find two positive perfect squares whose product is 1576. I'll start by factoring 1576 to determine if it can be expressed as a product of squares.

1576 can be divided by 4, which is 4 × 394. Continuing to factor, 394 can be divided by 2, resulting in 2 × 197. Since 197 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 1576 is 2³ × 197¹.

Next, to express 1576 as a product of two perfect squares, I'll need to adjust the exponents to be even. I can rewrite 2³ × 197¹ as (2²) × (2¹ × 197¹). To make both factors perfect squares, I'll introduce a term to balance the exponents. Adding a 197 term, the product becomes (2² × 197) × (2² × 197³), which simplifies to 1576.

Now, I'll calculate the ratio of the two numbers. Let the smaller number be x and the larger be y. The ratio y/x is given as 9/7. Therefore, y = (9/7)x. Substituting into the product equation x × y = 1576, I have x × (9/7)x = 1576, which simplifies to (9/7)x² = 1576.

Solving for x², I multiply both sides by 7/9, resulting in x² = (1576 × 7) / 9. Calculating the right side, 1576 × 7 equals 11,032. Dividing by 9, I find x² ≈ 1,225.333. Since x must be a perfect square, I conclude that x² = 1,225, so x = 35.

Finally, the smaller number is 35², which is 1,225. Therefore, the smaller perfect square is 35.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
Two positive perfect square numbers have a product of 1576 and a ratio of 9/7. The smaller number is ______.

First, I need to determine the total area of the plot including the road. To do this, I'll add the width of the road on all sides to the original length and breadth of the rectangular plot.

Original dimensions of the plot are:
- Length = 48 meters
- Breadth = 32 meters 80 centimeters, which converts to 32.8 meters.

Adding the 3-meter-wide road on both sides of the length, the total length becomes 48 + 3 + 3 = 54 meters.
Similarly, adding the road to both sides of the breadth, the total breadth becomes 32.8 + 3 + 3 = 38.8 meters.

Next, I'll calculate the area of the larger rectangle including the road by multiplying the total length and breadth:
54 meters * 38.8 meters = 2095.2 square meters.

Then, I'll calculate the area of the original plot:
48 meters * 32.8 meters = 1574.4 square meters.

Finally, I'll find the area of the road by subtracting the original area from the total area with the road:
2095.2 m² - 1574.4 m² = 520.8 square meters.

First, I need to identify the total length of the stick based on the given information. Let the total length of the stick be x meters.

The problem states:
1. 1/6 of the stick is in the ground.
2. 1/2 of the stick is in water.
3. The remaining portion is above the water, which is 2 meters.

To find the total length, I'll add up all the portions and set the sum equal to x:
1/6x (ground) + 1/2x (water) + 2 (above water) = x

Combining the fractions:
(1/6 + 3/6)x + 2 = x
4/6x + 2 = x
2/3x + 2 = x

Now, I'll solve for x by subtracting 2/3x from both sides:
2 = x - 2/3x
2 = 1/3x

Finally, I'll multiply both sides by 3 to find x:
x = 6 meters

Since 1/6 of the stick is in the ground:
Length in ground = 1/6 * 6 = 1 meter
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**

A stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) of its length in the ground, \( \frac{1}{2} \) of its length in water, and the remaining portion above the water. The length of the portion above the water is 2 meters. How many meters of the stick are in the ground?

---

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Let’s Define the Total Length of the Stick:**

   Let the total length of the stick be \( x \) meters.

2. **Determine the Length of Each Segment:**

   - Length in the ground: \( \frac{1}{6} \) of \( x \) → \( \frac{1}{6}x \)
   - Length in water: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( x \) → \( \frac{1}{2}x \)
   - Remaining length above water: \( 2 \) meters

3. **Set Up the Equation:**

   The sum of all parts equals the total length of the stick:

First, I recognize that a ""সমকোণী সমদ্বিবাহু ত্রিভুজ"" refers to a right-angled isosceles triangle. This means the triangle has one right angle (90 degrees) and two equal sides.

In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Since this is a right-angled triangle, one angle is 90 degrees, and the remaining two angles must be equal because it's isosceles.

Let's denote the measure of each of the two equal angles as x. So, we have:
90 + x + x = 180

Combining like terms:
2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 45

Therefore, the three angles of the right-angled isosceles triangle are 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and 45 degrees.

Expressing this as a ratio: 90:45:45, which can be simplified to 2:1:1 by dividing each term by 45.

So, the ratio of the three angles in a right-angled isosceles triangle is 2:1:1.
</think>

**Translated Problem:**  
The ratio of the three angles in a right-angled isosceles triangle will be ______.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Type of Triangle:**
   - A ""right-angled isosceles triangle"" has one right angle (90°) and two equal sides. In such a triangle, the other two angles are also equal.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Angles:**
   - In any triangle, the sum of all interior angles is 180°.
   - Since one angle is 90°, the sum of the other two equal angles is:
     \[
     180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ
     \]
   - Let each of the two equal angles be \( x \):
     \[
     x + x = 90^\circ \implies 2x = 90^\circ \implies x = 45^\circ
     \]

3. **Determine the Ratio of the Angles:**
   - The three angles are:
     \[
     90^\circ, 45^\circ, 45^\circ

Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

**Translation of the Problem:**
Abir has 10 notes of 10 Taka, 10 notes of 20 Taka, and 10 notes of 50 Taka. What is the minimum number of notes he needs to pay 190 Taka?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Denominations Available:**
   - 10 Taka notes: 10 available
   - 20 Taka notes: 10 available
   - 50 Taka notes: 10 available

2. **Goal:**
   - Pay exactly 190 Taka using the minimum number of notes.

3. **Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of notes, prioritize using the highest denominations first (50 Taka), then proceed to lower denominations (20 Taka and 10 Taka).

4. **Calculation:**
   - **Use 50 Taka Notes:**
     - Maximum possible without exceeding 190 Taka: 3 notes (3 x 50 = 150 Taka)
     - Remaining amount: 190 - 150 = 40 Taka
   - **Use 20 Taka Notes:**
     - Use 2 notes to cover 40 Taka (2 x 20 = 40 Taka)
     - Total notes used so far: 3 (50 Taka) + 2 (20 Taka) = 5 notes

   - **Verification:**
     - 3 x 50 = 150 Taka
     - 2 x 20 = 40 Taka

I need to find the length of the rectangular land given that its perimeter is 40 meters and the length is three times the width.

Let’s denote the width as \( w \) meters. Therefore, the length can be expressed as \( 3w \) meters.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( 2 \times (length + width) \). Substituting the known values, the equation becomes:
\]
2 \times (3w + w) = 40
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\]
2 \times 4w = 40
\]

This reduces to:
\[
8w = 40
\]

Dividing both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
\[
w = 5
\]

Now, calculating the length by multiplying the width by 3:
\[
length = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ meters}
\]
</think>

**Problem Translation:**
A rectangular piece of land has a length that is three times its width, and the perimeter of the land is 40 meters. The length of the land is _____ meters.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**

     \[
     P = 2 \times (length + width)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values and expressions into the formula:
     \[
     40 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     40 = 2 \times 4w
     \]
   - Multiply:
     \[
     40 = 8w

Okay, so I have this problem that's asking for the largest four-digit perfect square number. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what a perfect square is. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 25 is a perfect square because it's 5 squared.

Now, the task is to find the largest one that has four digits. That means it's the biggest number between 1000 and 9999 which is a perfect square. So my goal is to find the largest integer n such that when I square it, the result is a four-digit number, but not more than 9999.

Let me think about the steps to solve this. Maybe I can start by finding the square roots of the boundaries. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999. If I take the square root of those, I can find the range of integers whose squares are four-digit numbers.

So, square root of 1000 is approximately 31.62, and square root of 9999 is approximately 99.99. That means n has to be between 32 and 99 because 31 squared is 961, which is only three digits, and 100 squared is 10000, which is five digits and too big. So the n I'm looking for is somewhere in that range.

Since I'm looking for the largest four-digit perfect square, I should look for the largest n in that range. So n would be 99, but wait, 99 squared is 9801. Is that the biggest? Let me check 100 squared, which is 10000, but that's five digits, so it's too big.

But wait, maybe 99 is the correct one, but perhaps there's a larger number less than 100 that when squared gives a four-digit number. But n has to be less than 100 because 100 squared is 10000, which is out of our range. So 99 is the highest possible.

Let me verify this calculation. 99 times 99. Let's compute that:

99 × 99. I can calculate this as (100 - 1) × (100 - 1) = 100×100 - 100×1 - 1×100 + 1×1 = 10000 - 100 - 100 + 1 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = "

First, I need to determine the overall thickness of the book. Since the book has 200 pages and each page has a thickness of 0.1 mm, I'll calculate the total thickness by multiplying the number of pages by the thickness per page.

Next, I'll convert the thickness from millimeters to centimeters because the dimensions of the book are given in centimeters. This will ensure all measurements are in the same unit for accurate calculation.

After converting the thickness, I'll have the three dimensions of the book: length (25 cm), width (18 cm), and height ( thickness in cm). Finally, I'll calculate the volume by multiplying these three dimensions together, which will give me the volume of the book in cubic centimeters.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - **Dimensions of the book:** Length = 25 cm, Width = 18 cm.
   - **Number of pages:** 200.
   - **Thickness per page:** 0.1 mm.

2. **Calculate the total thickness of the book:**
   - Since the book has 200 pages, and each page is 0.1 mm thick:
     \[
     \text{Total thickness} = 200 \times 0.1 = 20 \text{ mm}
     \]
   - Convert the thickness to centimeters (1 cm = 10 mm):
     \[
     20 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ cm}
     \]

3. **Calculate the volume of the book:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (book) is given by:
     \[
     V = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
     \]
     Where:
     - Length = 25 cm
     - Width = 18 cm
     - Height (Thickness) = 2 cm
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     V = 25 \times 18 \times 2 = 900 \text{ cubic centimeters}

Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have two numbers: 2300 and 3500. We need to find the largest number that, when it divides both 2300 and 3500, leaves remainders of 32 and 56 respectively. 

First, I think I should understand what the problem is asking. We need the largest number (let's call it N) such that when N divides 2300, the remainder is 32, and when it divides 3500, the remainder is 56. So, mathematically, this can be written as:

2300 = N * q1 + 32  
3500 = N * q2 + 56

Where q1 and q2 are the quotients when 2300 and 3500 are divided by N.

Now, to find N, I guess I need to somehow eliminate the quotients q1 and q2 from these equations. Maybe I can rearrange the equations to express N in terms of the differences between 2300 and 32, and 3500 and 56. Let me try that.

So, subtracting the remainders from the original numbers:

2300 - 32 = 2268 = N * q1  
3500 - 56 = 3444 = N * q2

This means that N must be a divisor of both 2268 and 3444. Since we're looking for the largest such N, it should be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2268 and 3444.

To find the GCD, I can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method.

First, divide the larger number by the smaller one and find the remainder.

3444 ÷ 2268 = 1 with a remainder of 1176 (because 3444 - 2268 = 1176).

Now, take 2268 and divide it by the remainder 1176.

2268 ÷ 1176 = 1 with a remainder of 1092 (2268 - 1176 = 1092).

Next, divide 1176 by 1092.

1176 ÷ 1092 = 1 with a remainder of 84.

Now, divide 1092 by 84.

1092 ÷ 84 = 13 with no remainder (13 * 84 = 1092).

Since the remainder is 0, the last non-zero remainder is 84"

Let's denote Imran's runs as I and Sumon's runs as S.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. The total runs scored by both Imran and Sumon together is 58. This gives us the equation:
I + S = 58

2. Imran’s runs are 5 less than twice Sumon’s runs. This can be expressed as:
I = 2S - 5

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first to find the value of S.

Substituting I = 2S - 5 into I + S = 58:
2S - 5 + S = 58
3S - 5 = 58

Next, we'll solve for S:
3S = 58 + 5
3S = 63
S = 21

Now that we know Sumon scored 21 runs, we can find Imran's runs using the second equation:
I = 2S - 5
I = 2(21) - 5
I = 42 - 5
I = 37

Therefore, Imran scored 37 runs in the match.

Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. 

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. There are two trees in a park: a Banyan tree and a Pine tree. 150 years ago, the sum of their ages was 2961 years. Currently, the Pine tree is 1432 years old. I need to find out how old the Banyan tree will be 200 years from now.

Alright, let's break this down. 

Let's denote the current age of the Banyan tree as B years. Then, the age of the Pine tree right now is given as 1432 years. 

150 years ago, the Banyan tree would have been B - 150 years old, and the Pine tree would have been 1432 - 150 = 1282 years old. 

According to the problem, the sum of their ages at that time was 2961 years. So, I can set up the equation:

Banyan's age 150 years ago + Pine's age 150 years ago = 2961
Which translates to:
(B - 150) + (1432 - 150) = 2961

Let me compute 1432 - 150 first:
1432 - 150 = 1282

So the equation becomes:
(B - 150) + 1282 = 2961

Now, let's solve for B:
B - 150 + 1282 = 2961
Combine like terms:
B + ( -150 + 1282 ) = 2961
B + 1132 = 2961

Subtract 1132 from both sides:
B = 2961 - 1132
Let me do that subtraction:
2961 minus 1000 is 1961,
1961 minus 132 is 1829.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 2961 - 1132 should be 1829? Let me double-check:
1132 + 1829 = 2961

Yes, that's correct.

So, B = 1829 years. That means the Banyan tree is currently 1829 years old.

But the question is asking for its age 200 years from now. So I need to add 200 to its current age:

Future age of Banyan = 1829 + 200 = 2029 years.

Alright, so I need to solve this problem about the volume of the walls in a room. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

The room has a floor length of 4 meters and a width of 3.5 meters. The height of the room is 3 meters. The walls are 15 centimeters thick. I need to find the volume of the four walls in cubic meters.

Hmm, okay. So, to find the volume of each wall, I should calculate the area of each wall and then multiply by the thickness, right? But wait, actually, each wall is a rectangular prism, so the volume would be length × height × thickness.

Since there are two walls of each dimension, I can calculate the volume for one pair and then double it, and add the other pair's volume as well.

Let me start by identifying the dimensions. The room is 4 meters long and 3.5 meters wide, with a height of 3 meters. The walls are 15 cm thick, which is 0.15 meters.

First, I'll calculate the volume for the two longer walls. Each of these walls has a length of 4 meters, a height of 3 meters, and a thickness of 0.15 meters.

So, the volume for one long wall is 4 m × 3 m × 0.15 m. Let me do that multiplication:

4 × 3 = 12, and 12 × 0.15 is 1.8 cubic meters. That's for one wall, but there are two of them, so 1.8 × 2 equals 3.6 cubic meters.

Now, for the two shorter walls, their length is 3.5 meters. Again, the height is 3 meters, and the thickness is 0.15 meters.

So, the volume for one short wall is 3.5 m × 3 m × 0.15 m. Let me compute that:

3.5 × 3 is 10.5, and 10.5 × 0.15 equals 1.575 cubic meters. Since there are two such walls, I multiply by 2, which gives me 3.15 cubic meters.

Now, to find the total volume of all four walls, I add the volumes together. So, 3.6 cubic meters (from the long walls) plus 3.15 cubic meters"

First, I identify the given values: the principal amount (P) is 6500 TK, the amount after 4 years (A) is 8840 TK, and the time (t) is 4 years.

Next, I calculate the rate of interest (r) using the compound interest formula A = P(1 + r)^t. Plugging in the known values:

8840 = 6500 * (1 + r)^4

I divide both sides by 6500 to isolate (1 + r)^4:

(8840 / 6500) = (1 + r)^4
1.356 = (1 + r)^4

Then, I take the fourth root of both sides to solve for r:

1 + r = (1.356)^(1/4)
1 + r ≈ 1.1
r ≈ 0.1 or 10%

With the rate of interest determined to be 10%, I use this rate to find the new principal amount (P2) that will grow to 10200 TK in 4 years. Using the compound interest formula again:

10200 = P2 * (1 + 0.10)^4
10200 = P2 * (1.1)^4
10200 = P2 * 1.4641

Finally, I solve for P2 by dividing both sides by 1.4641:

P2 = 10200 / 1.4641
P2 ≈ 6967 TK
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution in English:**

We are dealing with a compound interest problem where we need to find the principal amount that will grow to a specified amount under the same interest rate and time period.

**Given:**
- Principal (\( P_1 \)) = 6500 TK
- Amount after 4 years (\( A_1 \)) = 8840 TK
- Time (\( t \)) = 4 years

**Objective:**
Find the principal (\( P_2 \)) that will become 10200 TK in 4 years at the same interest rate.

**Step 1: Calculate the Rate of Interest (\( r \))**

The formula for compound interest is:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^t
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
8840 = 6500(1 + r)^4
\]

Divide both sides by 6500:

Arunangshu is trying to solve the problem where the sum of three consecutive natural numbers is 63. He starts by letting the smallest number be x. Then the next two consecutive numbers would be x + 1 and x + 2. He adds these together and sets the sum equal to 63. Solving the equation 3x + 3 = 63, he subtracts 3 from both sides to get 3x = 60, then divides by 3 to find x = 20. Therefore, the smallest number is 20.
</think>

**Translation:**  
Three consecutive natural numbers add up to 63. The smallest number will be __.

**Solution:**

Let's denote the three consecutive natural numbers as:

1. \( x \) (the smallest number)
2. \( x + 1 \) (the next consecutive number)
3. \( x + 2 \) (the largest number in the sequence)

According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 63:

\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 63
\]

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

\[
3x + 3 = 63
\]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 20

First, I need to interpret the given ratio and understand how the total amount is divided among Labib, Sami, and Siyam. The ratio of their shares is 5:4:2, which sums up to 11 parts.

Since Siyam received 180 taka, this corresponds to 2 parts of the ratio. To find the value of one part, I divide the amount Siyam received by his parts: 180 taka divided by 2 equals 90 taka per part.

Now, to determine Labib's share, I multiply the value of one part by the number of parts he has, which is 5. So, 5 parts multiplied by 90 taka per part equals 450 taka.

Therefore, Labib will receive 450 taka.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the number closest to 98,765 that is divisible by 28, 33, 42, and 77. Hmm. Okay, first, I think I should understand what it means for a number to be divisible by all those numbers. Oh right, that means it should be a multiple of each of them. So, the number we're looking for must be a common multiple of 28, 33, 42, and 77.

Wait, but just being a multiple isn't enough. It should be the closest one to 98,765. So, probably I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers first. Once I have the LCM, I can see how many times it fits into 98,765, and then find the nearest multiple.

But how do I find the LCM of multiple numbers? I remember that LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that both can divide into. For more than two numbers, I think I can break them down into their prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears in any of them. That should give me the LCM.

Okay, so let's factor each number:

- 28: That's 2^2 * 7
- 33: That's 3 * 11
- 42: That's 2 * 3 * 7
- 77: That's 7 * 11

Now, to get the LCM, I take the highest powers of all primes present. So:

- For 2: the highest power is 2^2 (from 28)
- For 3: it's 3^1 (from 33 and 42)
- For 7: it's 7^1 (appears in 28, 42, and 77)
- For 11: it's 11^1 (from 33 and 77)

So, the LCM should be 2^2 * 3 * 7 * 11. Let's calculate that:

2^2 = 4
4 * 3 = 12
12 * 7 = 84
84 * 11 = 924

So, the LCM is 924. That means the number we're looking for must be 924 times some integer k. Now, we need to find k such that 924k is"

Let's denote the number of lychees Raju has as R and Roni has as Roni.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Together, Raju and Roni have a total of 690 lychees.
2. Raju has 86 more lychees than Roni.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. R + Roni = 690
2. R = Roni + 86

By substituting the second equation into the first, we can solve for Roni:
R + (R - 86) = 690
2R - 86 = 690
2R = 776
R = 388

Therefore, Raju has 388 lychees.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let's denote:
- \( R \) = Number of lychees Raju has.
- \( Roni \) = Number of lychees Roni has.

**Given:**
1. Together, they have \( R + Roni = 690 \) lychees.
2. Raju has **86** more lychees than Roni, so \( R = Roni + 86 \).

**Step 1:** Substitute the value of \( R \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(Roni + 86) + Roni = 690
\]
\[
2 \times Roni + 86 = 690
\]

**Step 2:** Solve for \( Roni \):
\[
2 \times Roni = 690 - 86
\]
\[
2 \times Roni = 604
\]
\[
Roni = \frac{604}{2} = 302
\]

**Step 3:** Now, find \( R \) using \( R = Roni + 86 \):
\[
R = 302 + 86 = 388
\]

**Conclusion:**  
Raju has **388** lychees.

Sabuj receives 3/5 of Dalim's share. Let's denote Lincoln's share as L.

It's also given that Dalim receives twice as much as Lincoln. So, Dalim's share is 2L.

Since Sabuj's share is 3/5 of Dalim's share, Sabuj's share becomes 3/5 * 2L = 6/5L.

The total amount distributed is 6300. Adding up all the shares: 6/5L + 2L + L = 6300.

Converting the terms to have the same denominator, we get: 6/5L + 10/5L + 5/5L = 21/5L = 6300.

Solving for L: L = 6300 * 5 / 21 = 1500.

Therefore, Dalim's share is 2 * 1500 = 3000.
</think>

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Translate the Problem:**
   - **Bengali to English:**
   Green, Dalim, and Lincoln are three brothers. Their father distributed ₹6,300 among them. Green received \( \frac{3}{5} \) of Dalim's share, and Dalim received twice as much as Lincoln. What is the amount of money Dalim received?

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let Lincoln's share be \( L \) in rupees.
   - Dalim's share is twice Lincoln's: \( D = 2L \).
   - Green's share is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of Dalim's share: \( G = \frac{3}{5}D = \frac{3}{5}(2L) = \frac{6}{5}L \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total share is ₹6,300.
   \[
   G + D + L = 6300
   \]
   Substitute the expressions for G and D:
   \[
   \frac{6}{5}L + 2L + L = 6300
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \left(\frac{6}{5} + 2 + 1\right)L = 6300

First, I need to understand the given ratios. The problem states that \( K : L = 4 : 7 \) and \( L : M = 10 : 7 \).

To find the combined ratio \( K : L : M \), I should ensure that the value of \( L \) is consistent in both ratios. In the first ratio, \( L \) is 7, and in the second ratio, \( L \) is 10. To make them consistent, I'll find the least common multiple of 7 and 10, which is 70.

Next, I'll adjust the first ratio \( K : L = 4 : 7 \) by multiplying both parts by 10 to get \( K : L = 40 : 70 \). Similarly, I'll adjust the second ratio \( L : M = 10 : 7 \) by multiplying both parts by 7 to get \( L : M = 70 : 49 \).

Now, both ratios have \( L \) equal to 70, allowing me to combine them into a single ratio \( K : L : M = 40 : 70 : 49 \).

Therefore, the combined ratio of \( K : L : M \) is 40 : 70 : 49.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the selling price and the cost price. The problem states that the selling price is 45% of the cost price.

To find the profit or loss percentage, I should compare the selling price to the cost price. Since the selling price is less than the cost price in this case, there will be a loss.

I'll use the formula for loss percentage, which is:

Loss Percentage = [(Cost Price - Selling Price) / Cost Price] * 100%

Substituting the given values:

Loss Percentage = [(100% - 45%) / 100%] * 100% = 55%

So, there is a 55% loss.
</think>

**Translation of the Problem:**
The selling price of a car is equal to 45% of the cost price. What is the percentage of profit or loss?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Selling Price (S.P.) = 45% of Cost Price (C.P.)
   - Therefore, S.P. = 0.45 × C.P.

2. **Determine Profit or Loss:**
   - Since the Selling Price is less than the Cost Price, there is a loss.
   - Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price
   - Loss = C.P. - 0.45×C.P. = 0.55×C.P.

3. **Calculate Loss Percentage:**
   - Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100%
   - Loss Percentage = (0.55×C.P. / C.P.) × 100% = 55%

**Conclusion:**
There is a 55% loss.

I will start by carefully translating the problem from Bengali to English to ensure clarity.

The problem states that after a certain number of years, the amount including principal and interest is 5,600 rupees, and the interest earned is 2/5 of the principal amount. Additionally, the rate of interest is 8 percent per annum.

To solve this, I need to use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). However, since the problem doesn't specify the compounding frequency, I'll assume it's compounded annually.

I will denote the principal as P, the time in years as T, the interest as I, and the amount as A. According to the problem, A = 5,600 rupees, I = (2/5)P, and the interest rate r is 8%.

Using the simple interest formula, I can express the interest as I = (P * r * T)/100. Substituting I with (2/5)P, the equation becomes (P * 8 * T)/100 = (2/5)P. 

I can cancel P from both sides, leading to (8T)/100 = 2/5. Solving for T, I multiply both sides by 100 and get 8T = 40, so T = 5 years.

Finally, to find the principal P, I can rearrange the simple interest formula: P = (100I)/(r*T). Substituting the known values, P = I * 25. But since I = (2/5)P, substituting back gives P = (2/5)*25P/25, which simplifies to P = 2,000 rupees.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Translate the Problem:**

First, I need to understand the problem: the total amount is divided among Labib, Sami, and Siyam in the ratio 5:4:2. Since Siyam received 180 taka, I should use this information to determine the value of one share in the ratio.

Next, I'll denote the value of one share as 'x'. This means Siyam's share can be represented as 2x, and since he received 180 taka, I can set up the equation 2x = 180 to solve for x, which gives x = 90.

Now that I know the value of one share is 90 taka, I can calculate Sami's share, which is 4 shares in total. By multiplying the number of shares by the value of each share, 4 * 90 = 360, I find that Sami will receive 360 taka.
</think>

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**
   - The total amount is divided among Labib, Sami, and Siyam in the ratio **5 : 4 : 2**.
   - This means that for every **5** parts Labib gets, Sami gets **4**, and Siyam gets **2**.

2. **Determining the Value of One Part:**
   - Siyam received **180 taka**, and his share corresponds to **2 parts**.
   - Let the value of one part be **x**.
   - So, \( 2x = 180 \) taka.
   - Solving for x: 
     \[
     x = \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ taka}
     \]

3. **Calculating Sami's Share:**
   - Sami's share corresponds to **4 parts**.
   - Therefore, Sami's total amount is:
     \[
     4x = 4 \times 90 = 360 \text{ taka}
